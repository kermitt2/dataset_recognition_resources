<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tet-controlled gene expression in vitro and in vivo</head><p><s>There are two complementary tetracycline (tet) inducible systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> which are based on three key components (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,b</ref>): (i) a tet transactivator (tTA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> or a reverse tTA (rtTA), <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> which are potent synthetic transcriptional factors, (ii) a unidirectional minimal tet promoter (P tet ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> or a bidirectional minimal tet promoter (P tet bi) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> to express multiple gene(s) of interest, when either tTA or rtTA binds to the tet operators (tetO)s located in P tet /P tet bi, and (iii) an inducer, doxycycline (Dox), a hydrophobic derivative of tet that controls gene expression and can rapidly distribute in different tissues in vivo, and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref></s><s>he operating principle of the tet systems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) is as follows: in the absence of Dox, tTA binds to the tetOs located in P tet /P tet bi to activate gene transcription, and in the presence of Dox, gene transcription can be switched-off, when the tTA/Dox complex unbinds the tet promoters (P tet /P tet bi).</s><s>The reverse tTA (rtTA) variants binds to P tet /P tet bi only in the presence of Dox (rtTA/+Dox) to activate P tet /P tet bi mediated gene transcription, and without Dox, rtTA is unable to bind P tet /P tet bi, thereby terminating gene transcription.</s></p><p><s>We have developed recombinant rAAVs to inducibly and reversibly control gene expression in the mammalian brain.</s><s>With our two-virus approach, we placed tTA or rtTA under control of a pan-neuronal specific promoter (human synapsin or hSYN) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,b</ref>).</s><s>For quantifying gene expression, we placed the firefly luciferase (fLUC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> and the tdTomato (tdTOM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> genes under control of a P tet bi (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>With P tet bi, these two genes were coexpressed for (1) live fluorescence imaging of neurons with tdTOM and (2) quantitative recording of luciferase (LUC) activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,b</ref>).</s><s>To normalize for the variability in gene expression, which is largely due to variability in virus infection of cells, we included a "tracer" virus to express the renilla luciferase (rLUC) in neurons.</s><s>The use of specific light-emitting substrates for fLUC and rLUC, D-luciferin and coelenterazine, respectively, enabled us to quantify gene expression in a ratiometric manner (fLUC/rLUC) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>), which are displayed here as relative light units (RLU) ± SEM.</s></p><p><s>First, we infected hippocampal organotypic slices with a cocktail of two rAAVs: tTA system (rAAV-hSYN-tTA2 + rAAV-P tet bi-fLUC/tdTOM) and rtTA system (rAAV-hSYN-rtTA2-nM2 + rAAV-P tet bi-fLUC/tdTOM).</s><s>Two weeks after virus infection, we detected robust Dox-induced, rtTA-dependent and tTAdependent tdTOM expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, middle and right panels).</s><s>Expression of tdTOM was undetectable without Dox (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, left panel).</s><s>Because the half-life time of the tdTOM protein is about 24 hours, it takes several days to deplete the tdTOM signal, when using the tTA system after Dox treatment (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>The fLUC on the other hand has a half-life time of only a few hours, enabling determination of Dox-controlled, tTA/ rtTA dependent gene expression time course, both in vitro and in vivo.</s><s>To quantify gene expression, we performed the LUC assays using a cocktail of three viruses; the tTA system (rAAV-hSYN-tTA2 + rAAV-P tet bi-fLUC/tdTOM + rAAV-hSYN-rLUC) and the rtTA system (rAAV-hSYN-rtTA2-nM2 + rAAV-P tet bi-fLUC/tdTOM + rAAV-hSYN-rLUC).</s><s>With the tTA system, RLU activity was about 18-fold higher over the baseline (without tTA or with tTA/+Dox).</s><s>In the case of the rtTA system, the RLU activity without Dox was near the baseline levels, and RLU activity increased by about 20-fold by Dox (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>We further demonstrated by NeuN immunostaining that the hSYN promoter allows for neuron-specific gene expression both in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The raw firefly luciferase (fLUC) activity values in brain tissue (both in vitro and in vivo), infected with the rAAV-P tet bi-fLUC/tdTOM alone (without tTA), were roughly 10 times higher than the background values (lysate without virus infection) (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, raw fLUC activity values with the rtTA system in the absence of Dox were roughly 10 times higher than the background fLUC activity (without virus infection) (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>The observed basal fLUC activity in the uninduced state is thus most likely due to the intrinsic leakiness by the tet responder virus (rAAV-P tet bi-fLUC/tdTOM), and leakiness increases with increasing number of rAAV-P tet bi virus particles in infected cells.</s><s>Consistent with our previous observations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> intrinsic leakiness by rAAV-P tet bi module is likely mediated by the rAAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR) enhancer-like activity onto the P tet bi. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>To reduce leakiness, we had to lower the rAAV-P tet bi virus titers</s></p><p><s>We also performed noninvasive bioluminescence imaging with the tet inducible systems using the enhanced firefly luciferase (eLUC), but the eLUC activity was not detected in the mouse brain through an intact skull (data not shown).</s><s>However, strong bioluminescence signal was detected through an intact skull, skin and fur with the mouse cortex injected with rAAV-hSYN-eLUC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>We further determined that the maximum eLUC activity from brain samples infected with the rAAV-hSYN-eLUC was quite similar to brain samples infected with the Tet-inducible systems (rAAV-hSYN-tTA2 + rAAV-P tet bi-eLUC/Venus, -Dox and rAAV-hSYN-rtTA2-nM2 + rAAV-P tet bi-eLUC/Venus, +Dox) (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>).</s><s>In the case of the inducible systems, the low virus titer (rAAV-P tet bi-eLUC/Venus) hindered signal detection from the intact skull.</s><s>However, the eLUC signal was detected, when the skull was removed (data not shown).</s><s>We propose that in future studies long-term regulated gene expression in mouse brain should be feasible by noninvasive in vivo bioluminescence imaging.</s><s>We further suggest that noninvasive in vivo bioluminescence imaging using the rAAV-hSYN-eLUC can serve as a reliable tool to control for the variability in virus injection and will help to identify properly rAAV-injected animals.</s></p></div>
