they are consistent with both the underlying condition of SBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and with the known intestinotrophic mechanism of action of teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) analogue that promotes intestinal adaptation and intestinal growth and increases absorptive capacity in patients with intestinal failure associated with SBS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> However, because GI complaints were recorded in patients randomized to active drug and those who received matching placebo, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref> it is not clear to what extent they were attributable to teduglutide or narcotic agents, especially considering that a large number of patients in both treatment groups were receiving narcotic agents.</s><s>This post hoc analysis was undertaken to explore the correlations between the incidence of narcotic use and abdominal complaints reported by patients with SBS during the phase III clinical studies of teduglutide, with the aim of understanding better the possible origins of these GI symptoms.</s><s>clinical trials, the pivotal STEPS study (ClinicalTrials.gov,</s><s>NCT00798967;

teduglutide and placebo were identical in appearance.</s></p><p><s>Both studies enrolled adult patients with SBS resulting from major intestinal resection secondary to vascular ischemic disease, volvulus, cancer, Crohn's disease, or injury.</s><s>Patients with a history of Crohn's disease were required to have been in clinical remission for at least 12 weeks before dosing.</s><s>All patients were required to have been dependent on PS for at least 12 months and to be receiving infusions at least 3 times per week for fluids, electrolytes, or nutrients.</s></p><p><s>Major exclusion criteria included active inflammatory bowel disease, history of significant systemic diseases (eg, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, infectious, endocrine, hepatic, or central nervous system), or radiation enteritis; prior use of native GLP-2 or teduglutide; use of growth hormone or growth factors within the past 3 months (NCT00081458) or 6 months (NCT00798967 [STEPS]); cancer within the past 5 years (not including resected cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma or in situ nonaggressive and surgically resected cancer); and premalignant or malignant change in colonoscopy biopsy or polypectomy (untreated condition for NCT00798967 [STEPS]; any condition for NCT00081458).</s></p><p><s>Local institutional review boards or medical ethics committees approved the protocols for both studies, which were conducted in accordance with applicable International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments concerning medical research in humans.</s><s>All study patients provided informed consent.</s></p><p><s>For this statistical analysis, data were pooled and analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression.</s><s>The dependent variable of GI complaints was identified by treatmentemergent AEs of abdominal pain, nausea, abdominal distension, vomiting, constipation, intestinal obstruction, appetite disorders, and GI stenosis and obstruction.</s><s>Independent variables were teduglutide treatment, narcotic use, and the interaction between teduglutide treatment and narcotic use.</s><s>Duration of narcotic exposure was not included as a parameter (narcotic usage captured as a binary yes/no response).</s><s>Narcotic agents assessed in this analysis were those captured in the concomitant medication record and included opium alkaloids, derivatives, and expectorants; opioid anesthetics; other opioids; drugs used in opioid dependence; benzomorphan derivatives; diphenylpropylamine derivatives; and phenylpiperidine derivatives.</s><s>Loperamide was classified as an antipropulsive agent and was not included in this analysis.</s></p></div>
