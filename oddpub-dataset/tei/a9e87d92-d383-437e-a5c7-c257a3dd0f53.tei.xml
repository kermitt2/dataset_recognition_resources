<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method which can detect metabolites and quantify their concentrations and other characteristics as well as any pathological changes in these parameters.</s><s>Recent development and optimization of non-water suppressed spectroscopy for in vivo experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> has expanded the range of measurable peak characteristics to include exchange rates.</s></p><p><s>The use of water suppression causes exchanging peaks to be suppressed, complicating quantification.</s></p><p><s>Using a non-water suppressed sequence allows not only for improved quantification, but also for exchange rate measurements using methods such as inversion transfer.</s><s>In particular, several peaks on the downfield side of water (typically between 5.0 -10.0 ppm) have protons which exchange with water.</s><s>In contrast, no peaks on the upfield (right) side of the water peak have direct chemical exchange with water, although there is some evidence of magnetization transfer effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>As yet, the downfield peaks remain mostly unlabeled, although previous studies on in vivo human downfield brain spectroscopy have investigated exchange rates or relaxation rates at a range of field strengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Exchange rates are of interest not only for optimization of spectroscopy experiments and sequence parameters, but also for pathology where concentrations may vary with the degree of disease severity or metabolic activity, or where exchange rates may vary with changes in pH.</s><s>Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) experiments in particular take advantage of exchange to measure the enhanced signal from exchanging species <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, and have thus far been able to investigate tumour severity and treatment, for example, using amide proton transfer as well as dynamic glucose-enhanced experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>CEST can measure exchange from a range of species with varying exchange rates, and mostly investigates species downfield of water; increased knowledge of the downfield resonances is therefore also of interest for the CEST community.</s></p><p><s>Although suggestions of labels for several downfield resonances have been made <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>, most remain unlabeled.</s><s>Additional characterization of downfield peaks and comparison to upfield concentrations in different brain locations may aid in determining peak labels.</s><s>Furthermore, ultra-high field strengths may aid due to the advantage of improved peak separation and increased signal to noise ratio (SNR), leading to acquisition of smaller, more homogeneous voxels within reasonable measurement times.</s><s>However, as field strength is increased, the shorter T 2 values of the peaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref> require sequences with short echo time (TE) in order to minimize signal loss.</s><s>In addition, at 9.4 T, even more so than at 7 T, B 1 radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity and power drop-off within the brain may render it difficult to achieve sufficient transmit power in the areas of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore for these experiments, performed at 9.4 T for improved peak separation, a home-built coil with appropriate power distribution and phase increment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, and a short-TE sequence, STimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> were used for enhanced acquisition.</s><s>In order to perform exchange rate measurements, the metabolite cycling (MC) (1) non-water suppressed sequence was used in combination with inversion transfer to investigate in vivo brain metabolites.</s><s>Furthermore, both upfield and downfield data were acquired in two different brain locations to compare known metabolite concentrations to downfield peak concentrations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Eleven healthy volunteers (mean age: 28 ± 3 years, 8 males and 3 females) were scanned for the occipital region study, and another eleven healthy volunteers (mean age: 27 ± 5 years, 7 males and 4 females) were scanned for the left parietal white matter (WM) study.</s><s>Written informed consent was given by all subjects before the examination, and the study had been approved by the local ethics board.</s><s>Spectra from two volunteers from the WM group were not included in analysis due to excessive motion artifacts in one or more of the data sets.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hardware setup and RF coil</head><p><s>All measurements were carried out on a Siemens 9.4 T whole-body MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a SC72 gradient system with a maximal nominal amplitude of 40 mT/m and a maximal slew rate of 200 T/m/s.</s><s>A home-built proton coil with eight transmit and sixteen receive channels was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Available peak power from the amplifiers was 8 kW with 50% line loss.</s><s>The coil was tuned and matched for each volunteer individually before the beginning of the experiment using a homebuilt tuning and matching box <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and a portable probe tuning device (Morris Instruments Inc., Canada), ensuring minimal reflected power.</s></p><p><s>For this work, we used a 16-channel phased array consisting of 8 overlapped transceiver loops (10 cm square loops) placed on an elliptical holder (clearance 23 cm height x 20 cm width) parallel to its surface, i.e. "horizontal" loops, and 8 receive-only loops each located at the center of the "horizontal" loops perpendicularly to the surface of the holder, i.e. "vertical" loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>To increase the amount of RF power delivered to local surface coils we used 2-way and 3-way splitters with 90° phase shift between the channels.</s><s>More details on the array design are published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Acquisition</head><p><s>High-resolution images from 2D FLASH scans (in-plane resolution: 0.7x0.7 mm 2 , slice thickness: 3.5 mm, 25 slices) were acquired in axial, sagittal and coronal orientations to facilitate the placement of spectroscopic voxels.</s><s>For the study on a region of interest (ROI) in left parietal white matter (subsequently referred to as the WM ROI) a 4.0x2.0x1.5 cm 3 voxel was placed in the left cerebral white matter (average composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>: WM: 78.6%, GM: 19.3%, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): 2.0%).</s><s>For the study on a slightly more grey matter-enriched area (subsequently referred to as the occipital ROI), a 2.0x2.0x3.0 cm 3 voxel was selected in a mixed gray and white matter area in the occipital lobe (average composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>): WM: 54.8%, GM: 41.5%, CSF: 3.6%).</s><s>Both voxel positions are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1:</ref> .</s><s>In particular, for the voxel located in the occipital lobe, only the three bottom coil elements were utilized, while in the case of the left cerebral white matter, the two left lateral coil elements were driven.</s><s>For both voxel placements, first and second order B 0 shimming was performed using FASTESTMAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and voxel-based power calibration was executed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Localized single voxel downfield (NEX: 96) and upfield spectra (NEX: 64) were acquired from each volunteer for both brain regions using MC STEAM (TE/TM/TR: 10/50/5000 ms).</s><s>In particular, a STEAM sequence was incorporated with an asymmetric adiabatic inversion pulse <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> during the mixing time optimized for MC at 9.4 T <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>For the selection of the three orthogonal slices, a hamming-filtered 90 degree sinc pulse with a bandwidth of ~8 kHz was used.</s><s>The asymmetric adiabatic inversion pulse had a duration T p : 22.4 ms and it was constructed of the first half of a sech pulse (HS 1/2 , R = 31.415)</s><s>for 0.9 T p and the second half of a tanh/tan pulse (R=100) for 0.1 T p.</s><s>The detailed nomenclature and the pulse parameters are described in the study of Hwang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, the asymmetric inversion pulse was applied with a minimum B 1 + : 22μΤ and Tx frequency: ± 350 Hz.</s><s>Moreover, the frequency sweep range of the frequency modulation extended from -22.7 kHz to 0.24 kHz <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the measurement of magnetization transfer between water and protons from downfield resonances, the MC STEAM localization scheme was preceded by a frequency selective pulse of duration</s></p></div>

<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Peak concentrations from FiTAID were scaled by the appropriate average water scaling factor: 75% (41056 mM) for GM <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and 69%</s></p><p><s>(38348 mM) for WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> based on previous work using the same voxel placement.</s><s>In order to obtain these average water scaling factors in the prior publication, average GM, WM, and CSF percentages for each examined voxel were calculated using a homebuilt MATLAB script which utilized segmentation (voxel size: 1x1x1 mm3) that had been acquired for each volunteer at 3 T.</s><s>In particular, the 9.4 T MPRAGE image from each volunteer was registered on the corresponding 3 T image assuming a rigid body

basis set consisting of 19 metabolites (alanine, aspartate, creatine, GABA, glucose, glutathione, glutamate, glutamine, GPC, glycine, lactate, myo-inositol, NAA, NAAG, phosphocholine, phosphocreatine, phosphorylethanolamine, scyllo-inositol, taurine) was simulated with PyGAMMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> based on experimentally measured chemical shifts and J-coupling values <ref

1.1-1.8</s><s>ppm from the χ 2 fit range (using the PPMGAP parameter) 2 in order to prevent a potential artifactual influence on the estimation of the macromolecular content.</s><s>For the upfield spectrum, absolute metabolite concentrations in mM ([Met] mM ) without correction for relaxation were calculated using LCModel water normalized concentrations ([Met] Nwater ) through the following equation:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[Met] mM = [Met] Nwater • W SF • 2 1 + 𝐹 𝑠</formula><p><s>where W SF is the mean water content as described earlier, and the factor scaling (acquired last), the upfield GM concentrations showed large inter-subject variations.</s><s>In order to remove the effects of the variable water reference on the occipital ROI upfield data, the upfield occipital ROI metabolite concentrations were rescaled based on the total creatine (tCr) peak. 1   For WM ROIs and for downfield occipital ROIs, the water variances were smaller and therefore the concentrations were left relative to water.</s><s>Spearman correlation coefficients and statistical significance were calculated between several downfield peak areas and upfield metabolite concentrations; Spearman testing was used due to the small sample size (N = 20).</s><s>The 6.8, 7.0, 7.3, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5 ppm peaks were compared to glutathione, GABA, glutamine, glutamate, or total glutamine/glutamate (Glx), which were several of the suggested assignments for those downfield peaks.</s><s>Correlation coefficients were also calculated between the overall upfield macromolecule concentration and the 6.8, 7.0, and 7.3 ppm peaks downfield.</s><s>For the WM ROI, where concentrations were not rescaled relative to tCr, comparisons were also made between the downfield peak at 6.8 ppm and tCr from the upfield spectra.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exchange fitting</head><p><s>Although up to fourteen peaks were fitted in the spectra, several did not evidence exchange in these experiments, or had such slow exchange that its quantification was not possible.</s><s>Exchange rates and T 1 values were obtainable only through the Bloch-McConnell model used for fitting the exchanging peaks, and are therefore only presented for the exchange-modeled peaks.</s><s>It should be noted that many of the resonances downfield are quite broad, indicating a potential for several underlying components; even exchanging peaks may be composed of more than one component, with potentially different exchange rates for different components.</s><s>However, the required simplicity of the model led to fitting the visible resonances with single peaks, with the T 1 and exchange rates therefore corresponding to averages over the components.</s><s>It can also be seen that the occipital ROI and WM ROI provide very similar exchange rates and T 1 times for the fitted peaks, as demonstrated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">6 and 7</ref>, with only two significant T 1 differences between the two voxels, for the 8.2 and 8.3 ppm peaks.</s><s>Similar values are expected not only because of the fairly high percentage of white matter in the occipital ROI, but also due to the equal proportions of metabolites and macromolecular baseline for WM and occipital ROIs upfield <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, therefore supporting the results found in this study.</s><s>Of particular interest are the peaks that were not fitted at 3 T (2), such as the 5.8 ppm peak, or the peaks which have improved separation, such as in the amide region from 8.2-8.5 ppm.</s><s>The 5.8 ppm peak, which was previously suggested to originate from urea (4), has a mean exchange rate of 7.4 s -1 from the combined occipital ROI and WM ROI experiments;

however, in this case the combined NAA peak cannot give us a meaningful estimate of T 1 , and was of more interest for its exchange rate.</s><s>At 3 T, this peak was modeled as one peak only, due to the broader peaks at lower field strengths.</s><s>T 1 's for the faster exchanging peaks vary, although the low T 1 for the 8.3 ppm peak may have been partially compensated by the faster exchange rate.</s></p></div>
