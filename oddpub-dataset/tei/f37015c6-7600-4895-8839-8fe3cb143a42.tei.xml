<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and objectives</head><p><s>This was a non-interventional, observational, postmarketing surveillance study.</s><s>The primary objective was to assess the change of symptoms following treatment with a fixed combination of pepsin and amino acid hydrochloride when used as daily standard therapy over a period of approximately 6 weeks.</s><s>Secondary objectives were patients' assessments of the frequency and intensity of their gastrointestinal symptoms and tolerability of treatment.</s></p><p><s>The study was performed in the outpatient clinic of the department for Natural Medicine of Charité at Immanuel Hospital, University Medicine Berlin, Germany, between January 2012 and December 2013.</s><s>The study was brought to patients' attention by means of advertisements in the local press and on the hospital's website.</s></p><p><s>Patients were examined at baseline, after 3 and after 6 weeks of treatment for assessment of symptoms and tolerability.</s><s>In addition, they were contacted by telephone approximately 1 week after they had started the study.</s></p><p><s>The study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (according to GCP-V, 2004) and all applicable laws and regulations.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</s><s>The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of Charité, University Medicine Berlin, Germany, prior to the study.</s><s>The study sponsor was Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Uetersen, Germany.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>The study included male and female patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a diagnosis of acute or chronic FD, as verified by their medical history.</s><s>To be included, patients were required to have had at least 2 of the following gastrointestinal symptoms present during at least the previous 4 weeks with at least moderate severity.</s><s>The latter was defined as moderately severe and moderately troublesome on at least 5 days in the prior 2 weeks: bad breath, burping, nausea, heartburn, feeling of fullness, epigastric pain (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Patients were also required to be evaluated according to the Rome III criteria for FD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> prior to inclusion (the study was conducted prior to the introduction of the Rome IV criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to the study treatment, patients continued their usual therapy for FD during the study.</s><s>Patients with contraindications for the study treatment, such as known allergies against the active ingredients or any of the excipients, were excluded from the study.</s><s>Patients showing alarm symptoms, patients with significant accompanying gastrointestinal or other diseases, pregnant or nursing women were not considered eligible, and neither were patients with a change in medication over the last 6 weeks or previous intake of pepsin and amino acid hydrochloride.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The aim of this observational study was to explore the effects of a fixed combination of pepsin and amino acid hydrochloride on symptoms in patients with FD.</s><s>The primary outcome was change in GIS© with treatment.</s><s>The GIS© sum score as well as the majority of its component scores were reduced significantly after 3 weeks treatment, with further changes observed after 6 weeks.</s><s>There were no statistically significant score reductions for the GIS© vomiting and nausea items; however, few patients reported these two symptoms and the scores for these were also very low both before treatment initiation and after 6 weeks.</s><s>In addition, in the subgroup of patients with symptoms meeting the Rome III criteria for FD, the reduction from baseline in GIS© was significant after 3 and 6 weeks.</s></p><p><s>Treatment tolerability in this study was good to moderate, with documented adverse reactions that were mostly related to gastrointestinal symptoms.</s></p><p><s>The patient population recruited for this noninterventional, observational study reflected the typical patient population with FD, with regard to age and gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Patients with FD, and those included in this study, show a variety of different symptoms such as bloating, early satiety, epigastric pain, nausea, sickness vomiting, retrosternal discomfort, heartburn, loss of appetite and abdominal pain, with these symptoms are present either alone or in combination <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>A broad spectrum of factors have been implicated as causes of FD, ranging from Helicobacter pylori infection through inflammation to psychosocial issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, and its management can be challenging once causes such as Helicobacter pylori have been excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Validation and retrospective studies have previously shown that GIS© is a reliable and sensitive tool for the follow-up of FD-related symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, enabling accurate differentiation of non-responders and responders.</s><s>Furthermore, scores documented by gastroenterologists and general practitioners showed strong correlations, and a strong correlation to the symptomspecific components of the validated Nepean Dyspepsia Index has also been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>With regards to interpretation of GIS©, a sum score of ≤10 corresponds to mild symptoms, where some symptoms may not be present at all and are thus impossible to improve <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, the mean baseline overall score was &gt;10, but decreased to &lt;10 for the whole study population as well as the large Rome III subgroup (74.2%).</s><s>Placebo response in this field may affect up to 20% of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>; however, in this study, FD patients meeting the Rome III criteria, for example, improvements in GIS© were observed in about one third of patients after 6 weeks.</s></p><p><s>The fixed combination of pepsin and amino acid hydrochloride evaluated in the present study has traditionally used as a mild agent for support of gastric function in FD <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Its precise mechanism of action is, however, unknown, although it is thought that the combination of pepsin and the acidic component should support digestion by aiding the stomach's proteolytic activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Further studies using in vitro  or animal models could shed light on the mechanism of action.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Firstly, this study had an observational design and was not a randomised clinical trial, the strength of the evidence obtained should therefore be weighted accordingly.</s><s>Patients with acute or chronic FD symptoms were included and perhaps a larger study is warranted where these two groups can be evaluated separately.</s><s>The study treatment was administered to individual patients at different dosages according to their treating physicians' judgement.</s><s>Therefore, although doses were within a dose range in the usage information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, there may have been variations between patients in the dosages taken for a given level of symptoms.</s><s>Finally, only 72 of 97 patients completed the study, with patients discontinuing mostly because of gastrointestinal symptoms, perceived as insufficient treatment and/or even possible worsening.</s><s>Patients with a long history FD should be advised in future studies as well as in clinical practice, that their condition needs long term treatment as the beneficial effects may not become apparent for several weeks.</s></p></div>
