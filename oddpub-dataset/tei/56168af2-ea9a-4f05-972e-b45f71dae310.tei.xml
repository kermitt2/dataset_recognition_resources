<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>While the sample sizes have the same order of magnitude (5,632 respondents for 1998 and 7,264 respondents for 2015), there are significant differences in the rates of internet accessibility, which could affect the compositions of the samples (Supplementary Information S2 for descriptive statistics) and the following analyses.</s><s>In Japan, personal accessibility to the Internet significantly increased from 13.4% in 1998 to 83.0% in 2015 (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 2017).</s><s>While company employees account for the largest share of respondents in both 1998 and 2015, which is consistent with population characteristics, there are certain differences between the years.</s><s>For instance, university students with internet access accounted for 14% of the respondents in 1998 but only 6% in 2015.</s><s>Part-time workers, the unemployed, and housewives with internet access accounted for 3% of the respondents in 1998 and 36% in 2015.</s><s>We calculated confidence intervals using the Krinsky-Robb technique in the following analysis on welfare changes and temporal transferability.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protest responses RQ 1: share of protest responses</head><p><s>The share of protest responses is greater in 2015 than in 1998 and larger for non-coastal residents compared with coastal residents for all three plans (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The analysis of variance shows that these differences in the shares by year and geographical origin are statistically significant at the 10% level for all projects.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protest responses</head><p><s>Protest response analyses are generally beyond the scope of WTP practices and benefit transfers.</s><s>However, our study revealed that it provides non-negligible information on successful conservation projects that are implemented in the real world, not in a vacuum.</s><s>Changes in the share and composition of protest responses demonstrated those in preferences for other aspects of a conservation project rather than the value of ecosystem services measured in WTP.</s></p><p><s>Overall, these shares are larger than the average share of protest responses in previous studies (mean: 17.69%; standard deviation: 11.30; median: 16.13; min.: 0; max.: 59.28)  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Meyerhoff &amp; Liebe, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The shares increase in 2015, which indicates the growing importance of protest response analyses as a source of information for conservation projects.</s><s>In addition to the possibility of an actual increase in the protest responses in the 2015 population, the drastic changes in internet accessibility resulted in biased samples with varying population attributes.</s><s>However, since there appears to be no study on temporal changes in the share of protest responses, we are still unaware if an increase in the share of protest responses is a general trend and of the factors influencing the increase.</s></p><p><s>We leave this to further study.</s><s>The analysis of the reasons for protest highlights the need for policymakers to be adaptive and rethink the manner in which projects are implemented.</s><s>More specifically, there is a growing dislike for payment methods (i.e., establishing a fund) (Reason 1).</s><s>In addition, respondents who do not want to personally take responsibility for funding (Reason 2) account for the highest number of protestors, suggesting the reconsideration of the payment method along with a reflection of those responsible for the past destruction of ecosystems and project beneficiaries.</s><s>Failure to account for these reasons could lead to policymakers facing unexpected oppositions at the time of actual project implementation, even if the WTP estimates that do not include protest responses indicate the projects as valuable.</s><s>The choice of payment method is an important aspect of a project scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Freeman, Herriges &amp; Kling, 2014)</ref> and this choice should be sensitive to the social context <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fischhoff &amp; Furby, 1988)</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the method of payment, the recipient of these payments is an important aspect warranting consideration given that, according to protest responses, some non-coastal residents prefer spending money on a similar project closer to their place of residence (Reason 2).</s></p><p><s>The protest response analysis was also informative in correcting systematic differences caused by the exclusion of the protest responses from the WTP estimate.</s><s>The logit models identified place of residence, income, and year as a source of systematic differences.</s><s>While place of residence and year seem to be straightforward, further study is recommended to explain why income can be a significant explanatory factor for why respondents cast protest votes to draw larger implications.</s><s>To obtain an accurate WTP estimate, we recommend the protest response analysis, especially when the share is not as small as that in our case study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Welfare</head><p><s>The confidence intervals showed that the welfare obtained from the projects measured in WTP was stable over the 17 years, except for non-coastal residents in the case of Project 2 (conservation of seagrass beds as cradles of the sea).</s><s>Because studies of long-term evolution of WTP for a specific site are lacking, it is difficult to determine whether our finding is unique or conforms to other sites as well.</s><s>However, these changes have the same order of magnitude as global estimates by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Costanza et al. (2014)</ref>, who used the world database for valuation studies on ecosystem services: the unit value of estuaries decreased by 8.2% (from 31,509 USD/ha per year in 1997 to 28,916 USD/ha per year in 2011) and the unit value of seagrass or algae beds increased by 10.1% (from 26,226 USD/ha per year in 1997 to 28,916 2007 USD/ha per year in 2011).</s><s>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pendleton et al. (2016)</ref> conducted a closer examination of the data compiled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Costanza et al. (2014)</ref> and highlighted the lack of accuracy and comprehensiveness, especially for marine and coastal areas.</s><s>For example, the database includes estimates from more than 20 years ago by assuming the temporal stability (or non-changing) of a unit value.</s><s>This supports the importance of primary studies on the temporal valuation of marine and coastal ecosystem services.</s></p><p><s>The changes in WTP can be explained by factors affecting demand or supply of the ecosystem services <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Skourtos, Kontogianni &amp; Harrison, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Factors affecting demand could include income, prices of other goods, and socioeconomic profile, while those influencing supply may be the amount and quality of ecosystem services.</s></p><p><s>There are three possible reasons for a higher WTP for Project 2 among non-coastal residents.</s><s>First, while Project 2 was the same in both 2015 and 1998, the context was different.</s><s>The 1998 survey presented the possibility of the seagrass bed being destroyed: "Moreover, 50 hectares of the largest remaining seagrass bed are currently proposed for reclamation as airport and harbor construction progresses."</s><s>However, since the seagrass bed was destroyed by 2015, the corresponding survey addressed it as actually destroyed.</s><s>This can be considered a scarcity signal.</s><s>Previous studies also show the sensitivity of WTP to changes in the supply of ecosystem services in the SIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tokiyoshi et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Second, the first reason may attract attention from those who do not live in coastal zones because they benefit from the airport and harbor construction.</s><s>Finally, the restoration of the seagrass bed became a national agenda, and the Fisheries Agency launched an investigative committee for seagrass beds and mudflats around six months prior to our survey.</s><s>There is no significant difference between Project 2 on one hand, and Project 1 and 3 on the other regarding the changes in protest responses probably because other factors, such as income and the various temporal factors shown in the logit models (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>) outweigh the three reasons mentioned above.</s></p><p><s>The PTEs were not large compared with those in previous studies: the mean of the mean PTE was 140 for the value transfer and 65 for the function transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosenberger &amp; Loomis, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The performance of a transfer is considered to depend on contextual similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosenberger &amp; Loomis, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Since these previous studies are about a spatial transfer (i.e., between spatially different sites) and not a temporal transfer (i.e., between temporally different but spatially same sites), the contextual difference resulting from the 17-year gap is smaller than the spatial differences in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosenberger &amp; Loomis, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>It is difficult to judge whether these transfer errors are small among long-term temporal transfer studies since such studies are limited.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zandersen, Termansen &amp; Jensen (2007)</ref> conducted a study on forest ecosystem services in Denmark and reported a PTE of 25 for 52 forests across a 20-year period.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boman et al. (2011)</ref> estimate this value at 17 for Sweden.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to general tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rosenberger, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rosenberger &amp; Loomis, 2017)</ref>, in this study, the value transfer performs better than the function transfer: of the six transfers, four are better as value transfers.</s><s>There are two possible explanations: temporal contextual similarity and insufficiency of the function transfer.</s><s>First, as <ref type="bibr">Bateman et al. (2011, p. 383)</ref> argued, "the choice of (value vs. function transfer) depends crucially upon the degree of similarity of the sites under consideration."</s><s>As the comparison of previous studies on spatial transfer revealed, study sites during 1998 and 2015 seemed similar.</s><s>Second, our function transfer did not sufficiently capture changes because in general, function transfers perform better than value transfers as the former can increase transfer accuracy by reflecting site characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosenberger &amp; Loomis, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>In technical terms, there are two types of changes that affect WTP estimates.</s><s>First are changes in the WTP estimate model's arguments and the second are those in the coefficients of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Whitehead &amp; Hoban, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>The function transfers in our study adjusted only income, an argument, and assumed that the coefficients are constant over the 17 years.</s></p><p><s>In addition, it is notable that non-coastal residents' mean PTE and its range for Project 2 are the highest for both value and function transfers.</s><s>This is reasonable because neither the value nor function transfer reflected the loss of the seagrass bed, a change in the supply side.</s><s>This indicates that, while welfare was not as sensitive to time even in the long term, it was sensitive to changes in the supply of ecosystem services (i.e., loss of seagrass beds for Project 2).</s><s>This calls a further study on contextually relevant research with particular focus on supply-side changes.</s><s>However, since Japan has been relatively stable in the socioeconomic sense, our findings do not rule out the importance of other contextual changes that affect the supply and demand of ecosystem services, such as income, demographics, perceptions of nature, and the preference structure of individuals, through learning procedures or cultural transmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Skourtos, Kontogianni &amp; Harrison, 2010)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future research</head><p><s>Our study is subject to two major limitations in terms of its implications for conservation projects: a biased sample and context-dependent results.</s><s>First, because of the significant changes in internet accessibility from 1998 (13.4%) to 2015 (83.0%), the sample attributes may differ enough to influence the results (see Supplementary Information S2 for descriptive statistics).</s><s>Second, the overall stability of WTP could be attributed to the specific context of Japan, where there is little drastic social-ecological change affecting the supply and demand of ecosystem services.</s><s>Therefore, the stability level found in this study might not be applicable to other areas characterized by drastic social-ecological changes, such as developing countries.</s></p><p><s>To derive more general implications for conservation projects, further studies on the evolution of preferences and development of methodology for protest response analyses are encouraged.</s><s>Further, given the asset of previous one-time studies on WTP estimates in various contexts and time periods across the world (e.g., Ecosystem Services Valuation Database (ESVD); Van Der Ploeg &amp; De Groot, 2010), a similar temporal study should be conducted by exploiting the asset to elicit more general findings about the long-term evolution of preferences for nature.</s><s>The accumulation of such studies would allow us to construct a more temporal-sensitive database for the valuation of ecosystem services and conduct a better temporal and spatial benefit transfer.</s><s>A caveat, however, is the availability of raw data used for past studies.</s><s>In particular, data for protest responses may be limited in their availability.</s><s>Priority should, thus, be given to cases in which drastic social-ecological changes and adaptive conservation projects are expected.</s><s>Furthermore, while our study used CVM, conjoint analysis, another stated preference method to measure WTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Louviere, Hensher &amp; Swait, 2000)</ref> may be promising.</s><s>A conjoint analysis uses profiles of a conservation project with various attributes (e.g., degree of conservation, development, and cost) and elicits respondents' preferences for trade-offs among these attributes.</s><s>This could be particularly useful when a project faces serious trade-offs such as conservation vs. development.</s><s>In addition, a conjoint analysis can capture marginal changes in WTP caused by changes in attributes such as quantity of ecosystem services supplied, and thus, could better capture factors affecting supply and demand for ecosystem services.</s></p><p><s>As our study showed, protest responses could provide non-negligible information for a conservation project in a real-world context.</s><s>Protest responses are by no means residual information.</s><s>In fact, several attempts have been made to use them (García-Llorente, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Martín-López &amp; Montes, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cunha-e-Sá et al., 2012)</ref>, although such analyses remain underdeveloped <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brouwer &amp; Martín-Ortega, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tobarra-González, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although beyond the scope of this paper, the readers should note that being based on economic theory, our study has a narrow focus relative to the broader spectrum of individuals' preferences for nature and their approaches to it.</s><s>What WTP can capture is limited in scope and economics is not the only approach to capture the preferences regarding nature.</s><s>First, WTP captures assigned values, not held ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brown, 1984)</ref>.</s><s>While held values represent certain types of behavior (e.g., loyalty), end states (e.g., freedom), and quality (e.g., beauty) that individuals value, assigned values are what individuals assign to a given change over alternative outcomes based on their preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Segerson, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Second, economic theory is silent regarding the motivations underlying individuals' preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Flores, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>However, exploring the motivations behind their preferences may be insightful for designing and managing conservation projects.</s><s>One promising approach is Schwartz's (2012) human value theory (HVT), which explains the motivational basis for both attitudes and behavior.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hicks et al. (2015)</ref> applied HVT to explore the motivations behind fishers' preferences for marine ecosystem services.</s><s>Finally, while WTP captures individual preferences, assuming consumer sovereignty with short-term focus, sustainable values assuming community sovereignty with long-term focus should also be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Costanza, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Norton, Costanza &amp; Bishop, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Since conservation projects typically involve long-term horizons, the preference inconsistencies between short-and long-term horizons should be eliminated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Norton, Costanza &amp; Bishop, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Norton, Costanza &amp; Bishop (1998)</ref> propose a two-tiered decision structure to eliminate such inconsistencies.</s></p></div>
