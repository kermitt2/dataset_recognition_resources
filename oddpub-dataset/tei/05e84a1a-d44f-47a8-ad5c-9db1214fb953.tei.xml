<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p><s>Susceptibility to obesity is linked to genes regulating neurotransmission, pancreatic β-cell function, and energy homeostasis.</s><s>Genome-wide association studies identified an association between body mass index and two loci near Cell Adhesion Molecule1 (CADM1) and Cell Adhesion Molecule2 (CADM2), genes encoding membrane proteins mediating synaptic assembly.</s><s>We show these respective risk variants associate with increased CADM1 and CADM2 expression in the hypothalamus of human subjects.</s><s>Expression of both genes is elevated in obese mice and induction of Cadm1 in excitatory neurons facilitated weight gain while exacerbating energy expenditure.</s><s>Loss of Cadm1 protected mice from obesity and tract-tracing analysis revealed Cadm1-positive innervation of POMC neurons via afferent projections originating from beyond the arcuate nucleus.</s><s>Reducing Cadm1 expression in the hypothalamus and hippocampus promoted a negative energy balance and weight loss.</s><s>These data identify roles for Cadm1-mediated neuronal input in weight regulation and provide insight into the central pathways contributing to human obesity.</s></p><p><s>Obesity is one of the leading global health threats with a projected burden on public health that appears interminable1.</s><s>Numerous reports support a crucial role for genetic susceptibility to the risk for obesity and related metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes2,3,4.</s><s>Recent studies have now identified ~100 susceptibility loci, which associate with body mass index and map near genes known to function in the central nervous system5,6,7.</s><s>Among the genes identified in these studies are CADM1 and CADM2 (also known as SynCAM1 and SynCAM2, respectively)7, which encode two immunoglobulin domain-containing, adhesion proteins that mediate synaptic assembly in the central nervous system8,9,10.</s><s>In this study, we illustrate how increased expression of both Cadm1 and Cadm2 in regions of the brain facilitates weight gain and how targeting their expression can provide new insight into the mechanisms leading to human obesity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SNPs associate with increased CADM genes</head><p><s>Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs12286929) and (rs13078807) in proximity to CADM1 and CADM2, respectively, which associate with increased body mass index (BMI) in human subjects6,7.</s><s>The SNP rs12286929 is located in an intergenic region 17 kb downstream of the 3' end of CADM1 and the SNP rs13078807 is located in the second intron of CADM2.</s><s>We analyzed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from 10 distinct regions of the brain available from the GTEx consortium and observed that both risk alleles (the alleles associated with increased BMI) are associated with increased mRNA expression of their proximal genes in the hypothalamus and cerebellum of human subjects: CADM1 (hypothalamus (Allelic effect: 10% s.d., P=0.05) and cerebellum (Allelic effect: 17% s.d., P=0.02)) and CADM2 (hypothalamus (Allelic effect: 19% s.d., P=0.05) and cerebellum (Allelic effect: 30% s.d., P=0.004)) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>,b and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,b</ref>)11.</s><s>Cadm1 and Cadm2 have been shown to interact via their extracellular domains (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>)9,12 and thus might act synergistically.</s><s>We therefore evaluated how altered expression of these genes contributes to the regulation of body weight using rodent models.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with our eQTL analysis, we observed increased Cadm1 and Cadm2 protein levels in isolated synaptosomes from hypothalamus, cerebellum, and hippocampus of obese and insulin-resistant Lep ob/ob mice compared to lean littermate controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>,c and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>Since administration of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and random blood glucose levels in Lep ob/ob animals13, we tested its impact on neuronal Cadm1 expression.</s><s>Feeding 16-weekold Lep ob/ob animals this diet for 60 days reduced the expression of Cadm1 in the hippocampus (hpc) and cerebellar regions, whereas the diet elicited no change in wild-type (WT) mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>-g and 10-14).</s></p><p><s>These results show that increased neuronal expression of Cadm1 and Cadm2 in the human and mouse brain associates with elevated body weight and indicate that these two genes may play a significant role in maintaining energy balance.</s><s>The reduction of Cadm1 expression in multiple brain regions of Lep ob/ob mice on a ketogenic diet also underscores the highlyregulated nature of Cadm1 and suggests it may contribute to adaptive or homeostatic plasticity within neuronal networks in accordance to nutrient state.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cadm1 regulates energy homeostasis</head><p><s>To understand the endogenous function of Cadm1, we first characterized a global loss-offunction mouse model (Cadm1KO) and observed a reduction in body weight compared to littermate controls starting by post-natal day 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b-d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3a</ref>).</s><s>A concomitant decrease in Cadm2 expression independent of changes on its mRNA level indicates Cadm1 may contribute to the stability of Cadm2 and its function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>), consistent with their physical association.</s><s>Cadm1KO mice had a lower proportion of body fat compared to controls but indistinguishable random glucose and insulin levels (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>Body length was slightly lower in KO mice (9.1±0.1 WT vs. 8.5±0.1 cm Cadm1KO mice, P-value&lt;0.05</s><s>at age 12 weeks) in addition to the body weight to length ratio suggesting the decrease in body mass was due to both reduced growth rate and adipose mass (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3b</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>We performed insulin, glucose, and pyruvate tolerance tests (ITT, GTT, and PTT, respectively) and observed lower glucose levels in Cadm1KO mice compared to controls suggesting systemic insulin sensitivity was improved (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3c-e</ref>).</s><s>We next tested sensitivity to leptin, another potent regulator of energy homeostasis.</s><s>Intraperitoneal administration of leptin resulted in a greater decrease of both body mass and food intake in Cadm1KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3f,g</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, consistent with improved sensitivity to leptin, basal plasma leptin levels were significantly lower and plasma adiponectin levels were elevated in mutant animals compared to controls (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As insulin and leptin signaling within the brain both influence body mass and energy homeostasis14,15,16, we next addressed whether energy expenditure rates were altered in Cadm1KO animals.</s><s>O 2 consumption, CO 2 production, energy expenditure and locomotor activity were all higher in Cadm1KO mice, while food intake, core body temperature and nutrient partitioning (based on respiratory exchange rate (RER)) were normal (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3h-k</ref>).</s><s>Evaluation of energy expenditure using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), as plotted in relation to lean body mass, confirmed the increased rates in Cadm1KO animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>)17.</s><s>When energy expenditure was plotted in relation to locomotor activity, this comparison confirmed Cadm1KO animals maintain increased energy expenditure and this elevated rate is directly correlated to increased activity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">3l,m</ref>).</s><s>Similar to Cadm1KO mice, global deletion of Cadm2 in mice (Cadm2KO) also resulted in lower body weight, and increased insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and energy expenditure without any change in food intake;
