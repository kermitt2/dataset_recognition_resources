<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>This study is a retrospective secondary data analysis using electronic medical records (EMRs) of pregnant women presenting to UMMC for antenatal care from January 1 to December 31, 2016.</s><s>A list of women presenting for antenatal care was generated by a Current Procedural Terminology code query, and their EMR records were examined.</s><s>Visits reviewed included their first antenatal visit until termination of pregnancy, delivery, cessation of care at UMMC, or December 31, 2016, whichever came first.</s><s>Records from outside hospitals and outpatient clinics were not reviewed.</s><s>Some women had more than 1 pregnancy that began or ended in 2016.</s><s>Each pregnancy was considered individually in analysis.</s></p><p><s>Data were collected from the problem list and medical notes on the number of antenatal visits at UMMC, history of IVDU, transplant, or blood transfusions before 1992, long-term hemodialysis, tattoos, piercings, and receipt of clotting factors or IgG before 1987, and whether each mother was tested for HCV.</s><s>Our definition of HCV testing was any testing for anti-HCV antibodies and qualitative or quantitative HCV RNA.</s><s>Among women tested for HCV, additional information was gathered on their HCV status, whether they were diagnosed during this pregnancy, and whether they previously had a diagnosed HCV infection.</s></p><p><s>Means, standard deviations, and proportions were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2013.</s><s>Associations between HCV testing and risk factors were calculated using 2-tailed Fisher exact tests.</s></p><p><s>The University of Maryland, Baltimore, Institutional Review Board formally reviewed this study and determined the analysis of this de-identified data set to be exempt.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Medical records from 1426 pregnancies were reviewed.</s><s>On average women had 6.6 (SD, 4.8) prenatal visits at UMMC.</s><s>Of the 1426 pregnancies, 100 (7.0%) were tested for HCV.</s><s>None of the women had received clotting factors or IgG before 1987, or had a transplant or blood transfusion prior to 1992.</s><s>Forty pregnancies occurred in women with a history of IVDU, 35 occurred in women with HIV, 6 occurred in women with tattoos or piercings, and 1 occurred in a woman with long-term hemodialysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Among 78 pregnancies in women with any risk factor, the majority (50/78, 64.1%) were not tested.</s><s>Of these 50 women, 17 had a history of IVDU, 22 were HIV+, 5 had tattoos, 1 was on long-term hemodialysis, 1 had previously had a positive HCV test, and 4 had multiple risk factors.</s><s>The association between having a risk factor and being tested (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) was statistically significant for pregnancies in women with IVDU or with HIV or any risk factor.</s><s>There was no statistically significant association between having a tattoo/piercing or being on long-term hemodialysis and being tested.</s></p><p><s>Of the 100 pregnancies in which women were tested for HCV, 10 (10%) were positive (0.7% of the 1426 pregnancies).</s><s>Eight were women with histories of IVDU (1 was also HIV+).</s><s>One pregnancy was in a woman who had a tattoo/piercing, and 1 pregnancy (10%) was from a woman with no known risk factors for HCV.</s><s>Five (50%) of these cases were newly diagnosed during this pregnancy.</s><s>Among these women, 4 were HIV+ and 1 had no known risk factors.</s><s>Three women previously known to be HCV positive were not tested this pregnancy (women with a history of HCV were retested for viral load).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>We found that 7% of pregnant women receiving prenatal care at UMMC were tested for HCV and 5% had risk factors for HCV.</s><s>However, among women with known HCV risk factors, nearly two-thirds were not screened for HCV.</s><s>We found that 10% of HCV+ pregnancies occurred in women with no reported risk factor.</s><s>However, the presence of tattoos or piercings was rarely recorded in the EMR unless the tattoos were extensive, or if piercings could interfere with breastfeeding or vaginal delivery.</s><s>History of IVDU is likely higher than identified.</s><s>Women may not divulge prior IVDU due to fear of legal retribution or discrimination from health care providers.</s><s>For these reasons, we believe that the actual number of women with risk factors was likely higher than reported here.</s><s>This finding of targeted screening being ineffective is not surprising.</s><s>Limited efficacy of risk-based screening in baby boomers has led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend universal screening in those born between 1945 and 1965 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We argue that universal HCV screening should be introduced during pregnancy.</s><s>Knowledge of HCV status changes how obstetricians manage patients in order to reduce the risk of vertical transmission (eg, avoiding invasive testing and use of fetal scalp electrodes).</s><s>Universal screening is logistically feasible and can identify new cases of HCV at a time when women regularly encounter the health care system and can be referred for treatment.</s><s>This approach has been successful for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</s><s>HIV screening in pregnancy is universal even though HIV-positive mothers account for only 8500 (0.02%) of births per year in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In our sample, 0.7% of the women were HCV-positive, which is likely an underestimation as only 7% were tested.</s><s>Additionally, HIV treatment is lifelong whereas HCV treatment is a 1-time 12-week curative course that will prevent the woman from transmitting infection to her future children or other adults.</s><s>Universal HCV screening with repeat screening in the third trimester for high-risk women, as done for HIV, should be implemented.</s></p><p><s>There has been resistance to HCV screening during pregnancy because of the significant side effects of past treatment with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin, and the teratogenic effects of ribavirin.</s><s>However, new highly effective direct acting antiviral agents are curative, have far fewer side effects, and may be approved for use in pregnancy once clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov</s><s>#NCT02683005) are completed.</s><s>Until then, they can be used to treat postpartum women after they have completed breast-feeding.</s></p><p><s>We were surprised by the number of women screened for HCV with no recorded risk factors.</s><s>It is possible that busy clinicians did not document risk factors they identified, were not clear about current screening guidelines, or had a high suspicion for HCV despite patient denial of risk factors.</s><s>It is also likely that some women were tested as part of a hepatitis panel that is often ordered following unexplained elevated liver function tests.</s><s>Also, despite national guidelines, many clinicians included HCV when patients requested STD screening.</s><s>Future studies of physician attitudes toward HCV screening may elucidate this.</s></p><p><s>Our study has several limitations.</s><s>As this is a retrospective analysis of EMRs, there may be missing data due to insufficient documentation of HCV test results or risk factors; or HCV screening conducted at another center.</s><s>Our data are from 1 center and may not represent findings at other hospitals or the nation at large, although similar results were found in a prospective study in Cleveland <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, we were unable to follow children born to these women and cannot comment on vertical transmission.</s><s>While future studies would benefit from a multicenter prospective design with standardized protocols for determining HCV risk factors at first antenatal visit and long-term follow-up of mother-infant pairs, we do not believe that this should delay potentially life-saving policy changes.</s></p><p><s>HCV is a promising target for eradication; it is curable, only transmitted by humans, and has a low infection rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The largest obstacle is identifying cases-individuals are often unaware of their status and have infrequent contact with the health care system.</s><s>Universal screening is already being rolled out in baby boomers.</s><s>Expanding universal screening to pregnancy could be an important tool in HCV control and ultimately eradication.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .
