<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Cell-based therapies started as a regenerative modality from pre-clinical analyses and now entered clinical phase analyses in various application fields.</s><s>Especially mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed for clinical application in cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and musculoskeletal disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Besides the therapeutic benefits of MSC treatment, a clear mode of action yet has to be resolved.</s><s>In addition, it remains unclear if the modes of action that are discussed are identical for all cell types in various clinical applications.</s><s>MSCs seem to improve among others (a) symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases by secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, (b) functional regenerating of myocardial tissue by a pro-angiogenic stimulation of the hosting tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and (c) functional regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue by means of a fiber type shift which results in higher contraction forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, it remains unclear at what moment after application and by which specific modes of action (a cell-cell interaction or mainly a paracrine stimulus or an immune-modulatory effect) the MSCs by themselves modulate the situation at the site of injury and thus enable regenerative cascades.</s><s>Evaluation of cell based strategies rely primarily on analysis of the tissues at specific time points after explantation e.g. by means of histology, gene expression analysis and characterization of the immunological statuses or functional testing of tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>So far, time course analyses of cellular recruitment, the validation of cellular survival or even the analysis of MSC engraftment into host tissues cannot be observed satisfactorily <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>To follow the time course or even characterize cells in the in vivo setting, modalities for live cell imaging and tracking are mandatory to enable non-invasive, temporal imaging of cellular kinetics as well as evaluation of cell viability after transplantation.</s></p><p><s>Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) may be a technique that could enable such in vivo imaging: the technique becomes more and more popular in pre-clinical analysis to address the above-mentioned aspects.</s><s>Apparently it allows non-invasive imaging over a longer period in vivo and in addition gives information on the viability of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Approaches on stem cell tracking in vivo have been reported, e.g. for the treatment of myocardial infarction (see review of de Almeida, 2011) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, in ischemic brain or spinal cord injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and in muscle injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In a rat model of ischemic brain injury human neural stem cells were labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles and tracked via MRI.</s><s>A major drawback is that a considerable loss of signal due to dilution of iron oxide nanoparticles by means of e.g.</s><s>cell division or possible artifacts due to uptake of particles by phagocytes challenges the precision of this approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>To investigate the in vivo distribution of MSCs transplanted into a crushed skeletal muscle, a study by Winkler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> using MSCs labeled with very small iron oxide nanoparticles (VSOPs) was initiated.</s><s>In vivo visualization was done using MRI after cell transplantation until day 42.</s><s>Clear MRIsignals of the VSOPs could be obtained over the observation period.</s><s>However, histological staining also showed that VSOPs were taken up by macrophages that reside in the crushed soleus muscle.</s><s>Even though MRI has a very high resolution that allows spatial analysis of transplanted cells as well as anatomic features it does not give any information about the viability of the MSCs.</s><s>Thus it can only be estimated how long MSCs survive in the highly inflammatory environment of a crushed skeletal muscle.</s><s>In a spinal cord injury model in mouse, Ozedmir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>tracked bone marrow mononuclear cells and MSCs labeled with luciferase.</s><s>The authors report a drastic reduction of the bioluminescence signal within the first week for various cell types.</s><s>The most promising approach was reported by Evereart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>They reported an MSC visualization that aimed at monitoring the homing of these cells to ischemic tissue in a hind limb mouse model using BLI after different injection strategies.</s><s>The bioluminescence signal was detectable until day 8 after transplantation though ischemiadirected homing of MSCs after systemic application could not be observed.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the approaches reported above, an in vivo imaging using luciferase has so far not been realized to document cellular behavior or survival in a severely crushed soleus muscle.</s><s>In vivo imaging using luciferase allows realtime monitoring of survival and migration/homing of MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a conclusion about the viability of the transplanted MSCs can be drawn, since bioluminescence can only be detected if these cells are able to produce ATP, hence are viable <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Even though some studies were conducted tracking stem cells using in vivo BLI in various animal models, no BLI imaging has been done of MSCs transplanted into an injury model such as a crushed skeletal muscle.</s></p><p><s>The aim of our project was to track MSCs in vivo after local as well as intra-arterial (i.a.) transplantation into an injured skeletal muscle, and to evaluate viability and migration behavior using these different administration routes of cells.</s><s>Furthermore we wanted to analyze if luciferase transduction altered the in vitro characteristics of the cells in terms of their differentiation, proliferation and migration potential.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study aims at investigating how long MSCs are viable and traceable after transplanting them into a traumatized skeletal muscle in vivo.</s><s>We used luciferase transduced cells and compared local and i.a.</s><s>TX of these cells.</s><s>A severe crush trauma of the soleus muscle in rat was used, that has previously been established as a standard animal model to monitor muscle regeneration with and without stem cell transplantation.</s><s>In previous studies we could show that both ways of cell administration lead to an increase of muscle force after 3 weeks of transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>In the presented study we used bioluminescence imaging to track MSCs in vivo and to gain information about their viability after transplantation.</s><s>Transplanted MSCs, independently of their administration route, could only be tracked until day 7 after transplantation.</s><s>Furthermore, the bioluminescence signal declined rapidly after day 1 in both groups.</s><s>However, bioluminescence signals in the local transplantation group were significantly lower compared to the i.a.</s><s>transplantation group (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4, 5</ref>).</s><s>This might be due to the different surroundings the MSCs had been transplanted into.</s><s>Direct transplantation into an inflamed tissue, i.e. the traumatized muscle, might result in increased cell death, since there was a phase of progressive destruction of the muscle tissue.</s><s>The blood stream might be a more favorable environment for MSC injection, since cell survival was higher even though half the cells had been cleared from the blood stream within 3 days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>Thus, a decline in the signal is presumably due to decrease in viability or number of MSCs.</s><s>Regarding the survival of stem cells in vivo, similar observations have been made in other studies.</s><s>In a recent study of Nakabayashi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> MSCs were locally transplanted into an injured tibialis anterior muscle and a rapid decline in bioluminescence signal was observed after 3 days as well as very little signal after 7 days.</s><s>Min et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> found a diminished bioluminescence signal within 8 days after transplantation of cord blood derived MSCs into the intact myocardium in rats.</s><s>Also, Zhuo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> found a decline of the bioluminescence signal of MSCs until day 7 in rats investigating an ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute renal failure model.</s><s>However, the survival of stem cells seems to be highly dependent on the environment they are transplanted into and also on the cell type.</s><s>Daadi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> could detect bioluminescence signals from embryonic stem cells in an ischemic rat brain until 8 weeks after transplantation.</s><s>Also the animal model itself has a major impact on the outcome of cell therapy.</s><s>Geuze et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> showed very impressively that after ectopic transplantation of MSCs in mice a bioluminescence signal was observed over the whole period of the study of 42 days in comparison with rats in which the bioluminescence signal declined rapidly after day 14 even though the transplantation setup remained the same.</s><s>The reason for this contradictory outcome remains unclear.</s><s>A decreased signal due to a detection limit can be ruled out, since skin and muscle have the highest transmission and penetration depth of the bioluminescence signal is up to 2 cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results indicate that MSCs are more likely to contribute to an improved functional outcome only within the first week.</s><s>Results from this present study as well as increased muscle force after MSC -TX, as shown before, support the hypothesis that MSCs contribute to an improved healing of tissue rather through a secretory effect, since differentiation does not take place within one week as also shown in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we could see in the present study that after i.a.</s><s>TX MSCs rather get trapped in the capillaries of the paw than actively migrate to the site of inflammation; in this case the traumatized soleus muscle.</s><s>These observations also favor the hypotheses of a secretory effect of MSCs that contribute to a better physiological outcome.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, tracking MSCs in vivo by using luciferase is a valuable tool for investigating cell based therapies.</s><s>The bioluminescence signal allows assessing the survival and viability of MSCs since the conversion of the substrate Dluciferin is dependent on the intrinsic ATP of the cell.</s><s>If ATP is not available D-luciferin will not be processed.</s><s>Thus, no photons will be released <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>However, using this method one has to consider the species as well as the model that is used, since bioluminescence signals seem to decline more rapidly in rat models than in mice models.</s><s>This has to be taken into account especially when comparing different animal models or transferring cell transplantation strategies from one animal model into the other.</s><s>Furthermore, the application strategy of cells has to be chosen carefully.</s><s>Cells are cleared differently when injected into the blood stream or transplanted locally, which could possibly influence the outcome of the therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>To our knowledge the presented data could show for the first time that transplanted MSCs can be tracked via bioluminescence imaging signal until day 7 irrespective of local or i.a.</s><s>TX following a skeletal muscle trauma.</s><s>The in vitro results prove that the transduction of MSCs with luciferase does not alter their characteristics regarding differentiation, proliferation and migration capacity.</s><s>Thus, these cells should bare the same properties in vivo as nontransduced MSCs, making bioluminescence imaging a suitable method for in vivo tracking of MSCs in skeletal muscle trauma in rats.</s></p></div>
