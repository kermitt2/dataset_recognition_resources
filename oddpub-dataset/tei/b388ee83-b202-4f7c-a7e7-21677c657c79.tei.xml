<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Perspective</head><p><s>The analysis was performed from the societal perspective, which included direct costs within the healthcare system [National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS)] and indirect costs falling outside this (i.e.</s><s>productivity costs).</s><s>A scenario analysis considered the cost utility of omalizumab from the NHS/PSS perspective.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Time Horizon and Discounting</head><p><s>The starting age of patients in the model was 43 years, corresponding to the mean age of patients in the GLACIAL trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The base-case model was run over a 20-year time horizon as it was anticipated that the majority of patients would have entered spontaneous remission by 20 years following symptom onset.</s><s>In determining maximum potential disease duration from the literature, a systematic literature review (see electronic supplementary material) found no primary studies providing estimates of remission probabilities beyond 10 years; however, the assumed time horizon was based on information from a review article by Beltrani which provided estimates up to 25 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Both costs and health effects were discounted at a rate of 3.5 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Model Structure</head><p><s>A de novo Markov model consisting of eight states that captured the major characteristics of CSU was constructed in Microsoft Ò Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).</s><s>In all three phase III trials of omalizumab, disease activity was measured using the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), a patient daily diary capturing severity of itch and number of hives.</s><s>This score was calculated over 7 days (UAS7), giving a score from 0 (urticaria-free) to 42 (maximum itch and number of hives).</s><s>Five model health states were defined on the basis of UAS7 disease activity: 'severe urticaria' (UAS7 = 28-42), 'moderate urticaria' (UAS7 = 16-27), 'mild urticaria' (UAS7 = 7-15), 'well-controlled urticaria' (UAS7 = 1-6) and 'urticaria-free' (UAS7 = 0).</s><s>UAS7 is a recommended outcome for assessing disease activity and is highly correlated with HRQoL measures in CSU <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, previous research has demonstrated that these UAS7 score ranges represent an efficient way to describe CSU health states <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The three additional model states consisted of a 'relapse' state, a 'spontaneous remission' state and an absorbing 'death' state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The model applied SOC as background therapy in both model arms.</s><s>In the omalizumab arm, patients received omalizumab as add-on therapy; no additional therapy was applied in the SOC arm, reflecting the phase III study designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Model cycle length was 4 weeks, consistent with the administration schedule of omalizumab.</s><s>During the initial treatment period of the model, patients could move from their beginning 'severe urticaria' and 'moderate urticaria' states to any of the five UAS7 health states every cycle, depending on treatment response.</s><s>A half-cycle correction was not applied as it was considered uninformative due to the short cycle length and the unpredictability surrounding patient transitions between health states.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Response Assessment</head><p><s>At the week 16 assessment point, patients receiving omalizumab could be classed as either non-responders or responders (response defined as UAS7 B6).</s><s>Non-responders at week 16 (those in 'severe urticaria', 'moderate urticaria' or 'mild urticaria' health states) stopped receiving omalizumab and subsequently received background SOC treatment only for the remainder of the time horizon.</s><s>Responders at week 16 ('well-controlled' or 'urticaria-free' health states) continued receiving omalizumab until week 24.</s><s>Between weeks 16 and 24, the proportion of responders to non-responders was held constant at the week 16 level; responders were redistributed among the response health states over this 8-week period according to data from the GLACIAL trial.</s><s>Therefore, week 16 responders were assumed to maintain a state of response until at least the end of the 24-week treatment course.</s><s>Patients in the SOC comparator arm were not assessed for response at 16 weeks and were instead treated with 24-week courses of background medication throughout the model time horizon.</s></p><p><s>At 24 weeks, all patients still receiving omalizumab (i.e.</s><s>responders) were assumed to stop treatment with omalizumab and receive only background SOC.</s><s>These prior responders were then retreated upon relapse.</s><s>This treatment schedule reflected the unpredictable nature of CSU, which may spontaneously resolve over time; in clinical practice omalizumab would be administered for 24 weeks and then withdrawn to monitor for potential spontaneous remission (remaining symptom-free with no active treatment).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">Relapse and Retreatment</head><p><s>The model incorporated relapse, defined as UAS7 C16 in the base-case analysis, as per inclusion criteria used in phase III trials of omalizumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Patients in the 'mild urticaria' (UAS7 = 7-15), 'well-controlled urticaria' (UAS7 = 1-6) and 'urticaria-free' (UAS7 = 0) health states were at risk of relapse from week 24, when active treatment with omalizumab was stopped and only SOC was continued in all patients.</s><s>Although classed as non-responders, patients in the 'mild urticaria' state were modelled to be at risk of relapse because they had derived some benefit and it could not be assumed that this would be maintained upon discontinuation of omalizumab.</s></p><p><s>Upon relapse, prior responders to omalizumab (UAS7 B6 at 16 weeks) were assumed to be retreated with a 24-week course of omalizumab; prior non-responders were not retreated and stayed on SOC for the model time horizon.</s><s>Patients undergoing retreatment were assumed to respond in the same way as in their initial 24-week treatment course.</s><s>This was based on a retrospective analysis, which showed that 25 CU patients had the same response rate and adverse event rate upon retreatment with omalizumab as during their first course <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, for patients who continued to exhibit a pattern of response to omalizumab followed by relapse, omalizumab treatment was modelled as intermittent 24-week courses, with length of treatment break varying depending on time to relapse.</s><s>Patients in the SOC arm who relapsed after an initial response continued to receive SOC and were subject to the same probability of response as on initial treatment.</s><s>As patients in the model are continuously on SOC, the model reflected this through a structural assumption of repeated 24-week SOC treatment cycles without treatment breaks.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3">Spontaneous Remission State</head><p><s>In addition to relapse, patients were also subject to a treatment-independent probability of entering a 'spontaneous remission' health state (defined as UAS7 = 0).</s><s>Patients experiencing spontaneous remission were modelled to remain disease-free and in a 'spontaneous remission' health state for the duration of the model time horizon or until death.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4">Discontinuation of Omalizumab</head><p><s>The model accounted for discontinuation of omalizumab due to lack of efficacy, adverse events or physician/patient choice.</s><s>Patients discontinuing omalizumab were treated with background SOC only, and it was assumed that they would not be retreated with omalizumab throughout the model time horizon.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Clinical and Data Inputs</head><p><s>The distribution of patients across health states for the first six model cycles was determined directly from GLACIAL patient-level data.</s><s>Three datasets using different imputation methods were available for the GLACIAL trial: the base-case analysis was based on observed data; baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and last observation carried forward (LOCF) datasets were explored in scenario analyses.</s><s>Health-state distributions for each model arm over the 16-week period up to the assessment point are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> (data previously unpublished).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1">Relapse Probabilities</head><p><s>Relapse probabilities for patients receiving SOC (those in the SOC arm or those who had discontinued omalizumab) were determined for each health state from patient-level data sourced from the 16-week follow-up period (weeks 24-40) of the GLACIAL trial (cumulative relapse proportions are presented in the electronic supplementary material; data previously unpublished).</s><s>Patients entering spontaneous remission during this time were excluded from the denominator of the relapse probability calculation.</s><s>In the base case, a linear extrapolation of cumulative relapse probabilities was used to calculate relapse rates for model cycles beyond 40 weeks; under this extrapolation, all responders had relapsed by 16 months.</s><s>Exponential extrapolation was explored as a scenario analysis.</s><s>Under this extrapolation assumption, some patients were not predicted to have relapsed at 16 months after omalizumab discontinuation.</s><s>These patients were forced to transition to the relapse state based on the longest duration of symptom absence with omalizumab use in CSU reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s></p></div>
