<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the Central Province of Sri Lanka, the crude prevalence rate of UC was 5.44/100 000 and CD was 2.33/100 000.</s><s>Traditionally, the highest occurrence of both UC and CD was found in the developed and industrialized countries of North America and Europe. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref></s><s>Although there is a relatively stable incidence in Europe, IBD has become more prevalent in previously lowincidence areas including Asia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> There are no national level studies in Sri Lanka on IBD, but the prevalence in the current study tallies with the previous hospital-based study done in two districts of Sri Lanka 7 years ago, except for a slight increase in UC and CD prevalence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> As there are not many population-based studies done in Asian countries, exact prevalence rates for IBD are not yet known for Asia.</s><s>Hospital-based studies would detect only the treatment-seeking IBD patients, which would leave out defaulted patients who are asymptomatic and those who take alternative (ayurvedic) medicine.</s><s>The increasing prevalence of IBD in Asia could be partly due to physician and patient awareness, increased availability of better diagnostic facilities; however, environment and lifestyle changes could have contributed to this.</s><s>Sri Lanka is undergoing socioeconomic change where hygiene is improving and dietary habits are changing.</s><s>A study done in 2014 in the Asia Pacific region to find the environmental risk factors for IBD revealed a more "westernized diet" and smoking were associated with high IBD risk but inverse relationship with antibiotic use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref></s><s>e gender distribution of this study was similar to previous Asian studies done in China, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong where the equal gender distribution for UC and male predominance for CD were found. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref></s><s>This is in contrast to Western studies, which show equal or moderate female predominance for CD.</s><s>Male predominance of CD may be partly due to the gender difference in smoking.</s><s>However, more studies need to be done to confirm this.</s></p><p><s>The mean age at diagnosis of IBD in the study was similar to Western studies where CD is diagnosed most frequently in early thirties, but UC tends to be diagnosed most frequently in the 30-40-year-old age group.</s></p><p><s>The disease locations of UC and CD patients were generally similar to the Asian, Australian, and Western populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref></s><s>arlier studies suggested a relatively benign disease course for UC and CD in Sri Lanka in relation to Western countries.</s><s>In addition, this study had a high proportion of CD patients with nonstricturing and nonpenetrating disease in contrast to Chinese <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> and European populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref></s><s>he remission induction treatment for IBD was similar to Asian and European studies, however, in this study, all the patients were managed medically.</s><s>This may be partly due to less disease severity compared to the West and treatment with biologics is the rescue treatment in severe diseases.</s><s>The use of biological treatment for CD was 23% and, as a developing country, the use of biological treatment for IBD being broadly similar to the West (22%) was a striking finding in this study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref></s><s>But, surely it would have improved the outcome of the disease.</s><s>The patients were given biological , Distal disease;
