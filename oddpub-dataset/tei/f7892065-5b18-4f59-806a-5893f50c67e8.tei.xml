<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In patients with compromised health, bone repair and remodeling present a clinical challenge for orthopedic surgeons, with the most common complication being non-union <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Treatment of bone non-union is critical in preventing progressive deformity, relieving persistent pain and subsequently achieving a total functional recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Consolidation of fracture depends on mechanical as well as biological factors, ranging from local cell proliferation and differentiation to vascularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Over the last several decades, intensive research efforts have focused on developing new approaches and technologies to enhance these biological factors for fracture healing and successful spine fusion.</s><s>Electrical stimulators, bone morphogenetic proteins and adult cellular tissue-based products harvested from cadaver bones have gained prominence in the treatment of bone non-union as alternate therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years, cell and gene therapies have garnered much interest from the scientific community.</s><s>The field of musculoskeletal regenerative medicine has been revolutionized through a better understanding of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>MSCs have extensive therapeutic application because of their ability to differentiate into structural tissues like bone and secrete trophic factors like osteogenic biomolecules that stimulate bone repair and regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The beginning stages of fracture healing are often associated with local inflammation, followed by MSC recruitment, differentiation and angiogenic activation phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Apart from mobilizing the patient's own stem cells to the site of bone injury with pharmacologic interventions, clinicians often use 'nonmanipulated' cell preparations that are likely to contain a healthy pool of MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>In the last couple of decades, several researchers have reported that umbilical cord blood (UCB) contains multipotent MSCs, which can differentiate into connective tissue with demonstrable clinical benefits in diseases not only limited to hematopoietic disorders [13-19].</s><s>There are several advantages for using UCB as a source for MSCs, such as the harvesting procedure of postnatal cord blood is noninvasive and does not pose ethical concerns, UCB cells have relatively low immunoreactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> and UCB-derived MSCs have high osteogenic potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Although often overlooked, UCB is also a rich source of cytokines and growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Some studies have attempted to correlate the presence of specific cytokines in UCB with neonatal disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Other studies have identified cytokines like PDGF, GM-CSF, etc., in the UCB plasma that may have therapeutic benefits during transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Cytokines are involved in different stages of bone repair.</s><s>Interleukins, such as IL6, MCP-1 and MIP-1, help in the inflammatory phase.</s><s>Specific cytokines act as 'homing factors' to recruit endogenous MSCs at the site of injury.</s><s>VEGF, PDGF, FGF-2, etc., also play important roles in proliferation, migration, and differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>However, there have been no in-depth studies to determine and quantitate the cytokines present in UCB-derived products (UCBps) that are currently available for clinical applications.</s><s>It is important to note that without the specific cytokines that can help in neovascularization and/or recruitment of progenitor cells, even UCB-derived MSCs cannot deliver on the promise of successful tissue repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>This is more relevant for bone non-union, which is commonly associated with damaged vascular supply with impaired access to important mediators at the site of injury.</s><s>Cytokines send specific signals to the resident bone marrow (BM) MSCs (BM-MSCs), which are then stimulated to leave their niche to be recruited within the vasculature of the tissue for transmigration across the endothelium (homing) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>Homing of exogenous and endogenous MSCs at the site of injury is a major cornerstone in tissue regeneration, which is followed by proliferation and differentiation into mature bone cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the full potential of UCB for bone regeneration can only be harnessed if both multipotent stem cells and cytokines derived from UCB are efficiently formulated in a cryopreserved allograft for therapeutic interventions.</s></p><p><s>Cord blood banking has guidelines to ensure donor suitability and quality of cord blood used for transfusion/transplantation.</s><s>Total nucleated cells and CD34 + cell population are the key parameters for selection and eligibility of cord blood units for transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the current industry standard for manufacturing clinically usable products derived from cord blood is not well defined and involves procurement of cord blood, followed by recovery and collection of the nonerythroid subsets of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, which are cryopreserved until application <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>The quality of the final cord blood-derived product is therefore dependent on two major factors: donor variability (maternal factors) and processing methods used to manufacture, package and store the product.</s><s>Mononucleated cell (MNC) count of the final product is a generally accepted parameter to determine overall quality of such commercially available products <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>However, the lack of any other reliable parameters to determine regenerative potential and biological efficacy makes it extremely difficult to predict the clinical outcomes of such products.</s></p><p><s>The current study is aimed at determining the bone regenerative potential of a cellular allograft uniquely processed from UCB to optimize high MNC count and to enrich cytokine content.</s><s>We hypothesized that if optimally processed, the final UCB-derived product could be significantly enriched with a broad array of cytokines.</s><s>Subsequently, after application to the site of bone injury, the product could alter the tissue microenvironment and activate the residing host cells to participate in various stages of bone regeneration.</s><s>We performed a first-of-its-kind profiling of 33 donors to determine the mean concentration of 44 cytokines present in this UCB-derived product.</s><s>Using in vitro model systems, we further provide evidence to establish the pro-proliferative, pro-migratory, proangiogenic and pro-secretory potential of conditioned media (CM) obtained from a UCB-derived product.</s><s>Taken together, our data provide insights into the molecular mechanism of action of this UCB-derived product currently undergoing clinical studies (NCT03064802 and NCT03077256) and being used for treating spinal fusion or bone non-unions.</s></p></div>
