<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Massive sequence-based analyses of genomic all-versus-all DNA-interactions (HiC-chromosome conformation capture) have revealed that the human genome is organised into megabase-sized topologically associating domains (TADs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Cis-regulatory interactions predominantly occur within a TAD, and these interactions are mediated by chromatin looping <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>TADs are separated by boundaries, enriched in transcriptional start sites, housekeeping genes, binding sites for CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulator factor, and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) elements.</s><s>The majority of TADs are identical in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and terminally differentiated cell types.</s><s>However, the Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene on chromosome 14 is located within a 2 Mb TAD in IMR90fibroblasts, which is split into two TADs (Domains A and B) by a hESC-specific TAD boundary (hESCb_2291) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>FOXG1 encodes a winged-helix transcriptional repressor critical for early telencephalon development, and FOXG1 intragenic point mutations cause a congenital variant of Rett syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Chromosomal structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions, insertions, deletions and duplications) may interfere with TAD structure by disrupting/fusing domains or boundaries, which may dysregulate genes with potential pathogenic consequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Due to long-range position effects (LRPE), chromosomal breakpoints 3 to FOXG1 lead to a congenital variant of Rett syndrome, similar to FOXG1 intragenic point mutations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Intergenic deletions have defined an ~430 kb (chr14:29,875,672-  <ref type="bibr">[5-7, 16, 23]</ref> and red bars indicate patients in the present study (P1-P6).</s><s>DGV: deletions/duplications present in the Database of Genomic Variants in healthy individuals indicated by brown area.</s><s>Striped deletions are those that were used in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to exemplify enhancer adoption by deletion of hESCb_2291 (vertical arrow between Domains A and B).</s><s>The black bar exemplifies one of several additional reported deletions that remove the distal enhancer hs433 and also hESCb_2291.</s><s>The orange region indicates the SRO-region as defined by ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, encompassing enhancer hs598 and the VISTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> negative elements HCNE1-4.</s><s>The SRO is further refined (darker shade) by the deletion in Patient 5 with only mild ID, but no other features of the FOXG1 syndrome.</s><s>The elements coloured in blue overlap with DNase l hypersensitive sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">303,</ref><ref type="bibr">083)</ref> smallest region of deletion overlap (SRO), more than 600 kb distal to FOXG1 in the distal part of Domain A, which defines a critical region with several conserved regulatory elements, deletion of which causes the FOXG1 phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, this SRO also spans hESCb_2291 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and it has been proposed that deletion of hESCb_2291 may lead to enhancer adoption <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, whereby regulatory elements in Domain B (e.g., enhancer hs433) are brought into ectopic physical contact with FOXG1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Whether the phenotypic effects of FOXG1-LRPE is due to loss of enhancers or silencers, gain of enhancer(s), deletion of the hESC-specific boundary, or a combination of these mechanisms, is yet to be answered.</s></p><p><s>Herein we have mapped three additional translocations associated with the FOXG1-LRPE, with breakpoints in the distal part of Domain A, providing further support for the proximal boundary of the SRO.</s><s>This is also supported by deletions and duplications proximal to the SRO region in presumed healthy individuals.</s><s>In addition, we identified a new deletion within Domain B associated with a different clinical phenotype, which narrows the distal SRO-boundary towards the highly conserved non-coding elements within this region, the loss of which has been proposed to be critical for the FOXG1 syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, we provide clinical evidence against the role of enhancer adoption as a major contributor to the FOXG1 syndrome.</s><s>We also included small deletions that remove either neighbouring TADs or TAD boundaries.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, we used the available virtual 4C and HiC DNA-DNA interaction data sets to show that the FOXG1 regulatory landscape in most human cell lines and tissues involves both Domains A and B. This may be even more evident in the mouse cell lines, where the human pattern of two (embryonic) TADs is fused into a single domain.</s></p><p><s>The proximal part of the FOXG1 regulatory domain is also enriched for the recently described frequently associating regions (FIREs), including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and neuronal progenitor cell specific FIREs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>However, the FOXG1-critical regulatory region does not overlap with FIREs, and apparently normal individuals may have deletions/ duplications of FIREs within the FOXG1 TAD.</s></p></div>

pregnancy resulted from in vitro fertilisation.</s><s>He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy, with a birth weight of 4100 g ( + 1 SD), body length of 56 cm ( + 1 SD), and head circumference (HC) of 36 cm ( + 0.4 SD).</s><s>Apgar score was 10/10.</s><s>At the age of 3 months, he developed generalised seizures.</s><s>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the age of eight months was normal.</s><s>At nine months, he was noted to have severe developmental delay, postnatal microcephaly and muscular hypotonia, especially in the upper part of his body.</s><s>Thus, the regression after a period of normal development which is one of the differential features between Rett Syndome and the FOXG1 syndrome was not present.</s><s>Ophthalmological examination revealed convergent strabismus and hypermetropia.</s><s>He had tongue protrusion, constipation and hypersalivation.</s><s>He had undescended testes on the left side; therefore, at the age of one year orchidopexy was performed.</s><s>At the age of 19 months, he had poor head control, could not sit independently, and had no speech development.</s><s>He showed behavioural anomalies including inappropriate laughter, bruxism, stereotypic hand and head movements, high pain tolerance and increased sensitivity to noise.</s><s>He had a 2 cm café-au-lait spot on his trunk.</s><s>He did not have any dysmorphic features.</s><s>Chest X-ray at the age of 2 years showed broad ribs.</s><s>At the age of 4 years, his height was 103 cm (−0.5 SD), HC was 45 cm (−4.5 SD), and weight was 15 kg (−0.8 SD).</s><s>He still had severe muscular hypotonia but better head control.</s><s>He did not show any breathing abnormalities.</s><s>Chromosomal analysis revealed a de novo apparently balanced translocation, 46,XY,t(9;14) (q22.3;q11.2)dn</s><s>(Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>No gain or loss of chromosomal material was detected at the translocation breakpoints by aCGH, but maternally inherited duplications at 15q21.12(47292250-47309868)x3 and Xp22.31 (6451676-8115124)x3 of unknown clinical significance were revealed.</s></p><p><s>Patient 2 (P2), a 5 year-old-girl, was the second child of healthy non-consanguineous Brazilian parents.</s><s>She was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy; she developed respiratory distress, and was admitted into the intensive care unit, where she remained hospitalised and intubated for the first nine months of age, with nutrition being provided through a nasogastric tube.</s><s>She presented with cystic adenomatoid malformation involving part of the left lung, laryngotracheomalacia and several episodes of pneumonia.</s><s>At the age of 2 months she had two convulsive episodes, and since then has been on anticonvulsant therapy.</s><s>At three months of age, the patient had a cardiorespiratory arrest due to accidental endotracheal extubation.</s><s>Tracheostomy was performed at the age of 4 months.</s><s>Her brain MRI demonstrated agenesis of the corpus callosum, with parallel appearance of bilateral lateral ventricles, dilated superficial blood vessels and occipital and temporal horns.</s><s>She was diagnosed with quadriplegic cerebral palsy with axial hypotonia and distal spasticity.</s><s>At 1 year and 10 months of age, her length was 84 cm (−0.19 SD), her weight was 11 kg

However, this SRO also involves the hESCspecific boundary (hESCb_2291) between Domains A and B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The deleted region in Patient 5, who does not present features of classic FOXG1 syndrome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), refines the SRO region to chr14:29,875,672-30,173,942 (darker shade in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, the five regulatory elements and rs1191551 (a SNP that physically interacts with FOXG1 and regulates its expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>), are still retained within this refined SRO.</s><s>The proximal limit of the SRO is supported by two of our de novo translocation breakpoints (P1, P2) as well as by two recently mapped BPs (DGAP245, NIJ1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>The proximal limit of the SRO is also in line with a deleted/ duplicated region observed in several healthy individuals (Database of Genomic Variants, brown bar, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which removes an active enhancer (element_566).</s><s>Thus, removal of at least one experimentally proven enhancer is not clinically critical (assuming that these DGV-deletions are of meiotic origin and present in the brain).</s><s>Kortüm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> proposed two putative evolutionary highly conserved cisregulatory elements (hs556 and hs342) as main elements regulating FOXG1 expression.</s><s>Whereas hs566 is within the region deleted in healthy individuals, the forebrain-specific enhancer hs342 is at the proximal border of the SRO and might thus also be a good candidate for a phenotype relevant cis-regulatory element.</s></p><p><s>Patient 4 was one of the patients carrying a deletion used to exemplify the enhancer adoption hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>According to this hypothesis, regulatory elements in Domain B (i.e., hs433) are brought into physical contact with FOXG1, leading to ectopic regulation of the gene and consequently the FOXG1 syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, topological domain boundary disruption (TDBD) would be a better explanation for misexpression of FOXG1 than the removal of silencer elements.</s><s>However, this deletion and the two other described deletions remove the SRO and hence the five aforementioned regulatory elements.</s><s>Importantly, both Patient 4 and the translocation carriers (Patients 1-3) have clinical features similar to FOXG1 intragenic point mutation carriers.</s><s>Moreover, there is no clinical difference between Patient 4, invoked to represent enhancer adoption (of enhancer hs433), and a patient (case 1) reported by Ellaway et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> in which a microdeletion removed both the hESCspecific boundary and hs433 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These genotype-phenotype correlations are further supported by DNA-DNA interaction data.</s><s>Although Virtual 4C-profiles and HiC-heatmaps indicate that Domains A and B are two separate domains, with a stronger interaction between FOXG1 and Domain A, chromatin loops that link FOXG1 with Domain B are evident in several cell lines, supporting that Domain B is also a part of the normal FOXG1 regulatory landscape (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, the splitting into Domains A and B is only present in two (embryonic) out of 14 tissues and 7 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>This pattern is even more evident in the mouse cell lines.</s><s>The heterozygous Foxg1 +/− mouse model resembles the human FOXG1 syndrome, with postnatal microcephaly, hyperlocomotion and severe impairment of visual function <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>.</s><s>The four regulatory elements in the critical SRO region are conserved in the mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, whereas the mouse HiC-data support a fused domain with little evidence of the human hESC-specific TAD boundary (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, the deletion in P6, which is associated with a different phenotype than the FOXG1 syndrome, fits with the notion that TAD-boundaries are LRPE-boundaries as well (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Recently the enhancer-promoter interactions within a range of 500 kb reported by the ENCODE project <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> were used for the prediction of LRPE-associated chromosomal  breakpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Our study illustrates a limitation of the ENCODE interaction data for LRPE-prediction in very large regulatory landscapes such as the FOXG1 locus, where the SRO and several of the LRPE-associated breakpoints are located &gt; 500 kb from FOXG1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Also, factors outside of the SRO could be important for proper cis-acting regulation over long distances.</s><s>Recently, small regions with tissue-specific increased interactions (frequently associating regions (FIREs) were described, that are enriched for disease-associated SNPs and overlap with active enhancers in a tissue-specific manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>We note that the proximal part of the FOXG1 regulatory domain is enriched for FIREs, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and neuronal progenitor cell-specific FIREs, which are embedded within the chromatin loops (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>The FOXG1 critical regulatory region does not overlap significantly with FIREs, whereas the DGV-deletions/duplications in assumed healthy individuals involve several brain-specific FIREs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the consequences of mutating FIREs remain to be shown, e.g., by functional studies.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we provide clinical and molecular evidence against the enhancer adoption hypothesis suggested by Ibn Salem et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, both human and mouse virtual 4C and HiC-heatmaps indicate that the regulatory domain of FOXG1 includes both Domains A and B, arguing against the clinical importance of a selective loss of the hESC-specific TAD boundary.</s><s>The combined clinical and molecular evidence support that the loss of regulatory elements within the refined SRO is the main cause of the FOXG1 syndrome in patients with structural rearrangements associated with LRPE.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.
