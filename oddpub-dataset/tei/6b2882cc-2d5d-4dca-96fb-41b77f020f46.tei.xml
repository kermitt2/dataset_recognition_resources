<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Patients and control individuals</head><p><s>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (approval number 11-166) of the University of Lübeck and was conducted as a multi-center study.</s><s>Patients were enrolled by 12 Dermatology Centers in Germany and the Interdisciplinary Allergy Division, Departments of Internal Medicine of the Research Center Borstel and Lübeck University Clinic, Germany.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were allergy to meat/innards, anaphylaxis, and severe urticaria due to unknown causes (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2 and 3</ref>).</s><s>Healthy individuals with no history of MA and who declared to consume meat without symptoms were included as negative controls (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>IgE-mediated food allergy to meat/innards was diagnosed only if there was also a history of an acute systemic allergic reaction.</s><s>Food challenge tests were not performed in all allergy centers.</s><s>If performed, oral provocation tests were conducted according to open food challenge protocols, German version for physicians. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Immunohistochemistry on meat and kidney</head><p><s>Pork and beef muscle meat as well as porcine and bovine kidney tis-sue were fixed and paraffin-embedded by the HOPE technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>Briefly, after deparaffinization and blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity by 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 minutes at room temperature, slides were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and blocking was performed for 5 minutes in blocking solution (Zytomed Systems).</s><s>After washing in TBS, the primary antibody against the α-Gal epitope (monoclonal antibody M86, Enzo Life Sciences) was applied in a dilution of 1:5 in antibody diluent (Zytomed Systems).</s><s>After application of the blocking solution (1:2 dilution in antibody diluent) for 15 minutes, slides were washed in TBS (3×5 minutes).</s><s>After incubation with the secondary detection antibody anti-mouse IgM/IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch), tissues were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) polymer (1:2 diluted in antibody diluent) for 20 minutes.</s><s>(Zytomed Systems).</s><s>After washing in TBS (3×5 minutes), aminoethylcarbazole was applied as a chromogen and slides were washed, counterstained with Mayer's hemalum, and mounted.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| Detection of allergen-specific IgE antibodies by CAP-FEIA (ImmunoCAP®)</head><p><s>All patient sera were investigated for IgE binding to α-Gal-containing CTX. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>urthermore, specific IgE to the following commercially available test allergens were measured in order to characterize the individual sensitization patterns: bovine thyroglobulin (allergen Bos d TG), beef and pork meat extract, BSA (allergen Bos d 6), and pig urine protein (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific/Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden).</s><s>In addition, total serum IgE (normal &lt;100 kU/L) and baseline serum tryptase (normal range &lt;11 μg/L) were determined.</s><s>Some sera were diluted to obtain a sufficient volume for analysis.</s><s>The assays were performed on ImmunoCAP® 250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific/Phadia).</s><s>The instrument threshold for a positive signal was 0.1 kU/L according to the manufacturer (Phadia).</s><s>The cutoff commonly used for allergy diagnostics by clinicians is 0.35 kU/L, which is also used in our study.</s></p></div>

Bound IgE antibodies were detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (monoclonal mouse anti-human IgE Fc, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) after incubation for 2 hours in a dilution of 1:10 000 in TBST.</s><s>HRP substrate was added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clarity kit; Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) and signals were visualized by a luminescence readout system (Chemidoc; Bio-Rad).</s></p></div>

but so far unidentified meat-/innards-allergic patients in the IA patient group.</s><s>This characterization was performed by immunoblot analyses using different α-Gal-containing analytes and controls.</s><s>The carbohydrate α-Gal coupled to a nonimmunogenic protein carrier (HSA-α-Gal) was used to determine the α-Gal specificity along with the α-Gal-containing antibody CTX and the commercial ImmunoCAP® analyte Bos d TG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>As expected from the ImmunoCAP® analyses, a majority of MA patients has a strong IgE response against CTX (30/33), generally associated with IgE against the other α-Gal-containing analytes HSA-α-Gal and Bos d TG (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the IgE binding pattern associated with MA (parallel binding to CTX, HSA-α-Gal, and Bos d TG, eg, MA patients MA3, MA6, MA9, MA13, MA14, MA15, MA17, MA18, MA22, MA24, MA25, MA27-29, MA32, and the individual HC32, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2 and 4</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) is now interpreted as "α-Gal-dependent binding" and characteristic for α-Gal-associated MA patients.</s><s>However, distinct sensitization patterns and/or IgE affinity to different α-Gal-containing analytes are observable as IgE binding only to CTX (MA1, 5, 10, 16, 19, 21, 26, and 33) or Bos d TG (MA4).</s><s>Differences in IgE binding to HSA-α-Gal2 and HSA-α-Gal3 were also detected by dot blot: IgE binding to HSA-α-Gal2 was detected in 8 of 19 HSA-α-Gal3-binding sera (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Two sera from MA patients which were negative in ImmunoCAP® analyses were also negative in the dot blot assay (MA8 and 31).</s><s>The serum negative for

cross-react with human TG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>) which is 77% identical on the amino acid level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>This IgE against Bos d TG is not derived from an autoimmunity background as determined by analysis of thyroid autoimmunity parameters (Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>No IgE signals for the negative control analytes HSA or BSA (Bos d 6) were observed for any analyzed serum.</s><s>Sera HC25 and MA22 were found to bind to IFX, an antibody which is similar to CTX in amino acid sequence but different in glycosylation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2 and 4</ref>).</s><s>While IgE from serum HC25 is binding to CTX and IFX and does not bind to HSA-α-Gal and Bos d TG (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), IgE from serum MA22 also binds to the latter α-Gal-containing analytes.</s><s>Thus, patient MA22 seems to have a mixed sensitization profile: α-Gal-dependent (CTX/HSA-α-Gal/Bos d TG) as well as IgG peptide-dependent (CTX/IFX, HC25-like pattern).</s><s>IgE only against CTX was detected in IA patient sera IA12, 14, 21, 23, 24, and 32 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</s><s>For sera IA30 and 34, isolated IgE against Bos d TG was identified (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Most of the sera from the IA group show no IgE binding to α-Gal analytes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>However, for sera IA28 and IA33, the full α-Gal cross-reactivity spectrum which is typical for MA patients could be identified and was confirmed by oral challenge for patient IA28 (Table <ref type="table"

kidney in comparison with the respective muscle meat was performed, revealing a higher concentration of α-Gal in porcine kidney compared to muscle meat (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Thus,

has been provided for allergy testing during the course of our investigation (in 2014), the established immunoblot with the α-Gal-containing components CTX, HSA-α-Gal2/3, and Bos d TG provides enhanced immunological and diagnostic information regarding individual sensitization.</s><s>HSA-α-Gal was included with and without the GlcNAc monosaccharide because of the previous observation that HSA-α-Gal3 has a sevenfold higher affinity to α-Gal-specific antibodies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>omparison of the immunoblot-derived IgE cross-reactivity results from HC sera with the groups of MA and IA patients allows an identification of a typical "α-Gal-associated IgE binding pattern": CTX, HSA-α-Gal, and Bos d TG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>Having identified this pattern, IgE sensitization patterns associated with α-Gal shall be detected in sera of IA patients.</s><s>This analysis is of considerable interest, in particular where this is the only evidence for a potential (delayed) anaphylaxis to meat.</s><s>This MA-associated pattern was clearly determined for two IA patients with suspected MA: IA28 and IA33.</s><s>For IA28, the diagnostic result already was substantiated via oral food challenge (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>Of note, the one HC individual identified with this binding pattern (HC32) had reported regular meat consumption without any problems.</s><s>As dot test with his serum revealed the "MA sensitization pattern", it remains to be determined whether a clinical reaction in this individual may develop after ingestion of a very high amount of meat/innards.</s><s>Those MA patients negative for all parameters in both singleplex and dot blot analysis, but with clinical reactions to meat, may be IgE-reactive to meat allergens not available for allergy diagnostic tests so far (myoglobulin, hemoglobin, the 81-kDa protein, the 51-kDa phosphoglucomutase). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Sera IA12, 21, 30, and 34 were negative in ImmunoCAP® with CTX but positive in

cross-reactivity analysis, we could demonstrate that isolated IgE against Bos d TG without HSA-α-Gal and CTX association seems to be relatively frequent in the (healthy) population.</s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> This IgE is most likely not derived from an autoimmune background as confirmed by full thyroid autoimmune serum diagnostics (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5 and S2</ref>).</s><s>It is very important to mention that TG as a natural bovine protein is not defined in its glycan structure and contains not only α-Gal, but also the immunogenic nonhuman carbohydrate N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the high mannose N-glycan motif which may con-tribute to IgE binding (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Although it has been published that the monomer Neu5Gc bound to a hydrocarbon linker is not IgE binding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> natural Neu5Gc as part of an N-glycan attached to an allergen is structurally different and may be binding to IgE.</s><s>It has been shown that Neu5Gc is highly immunogenic so that it can be used to arm the human immune system for cancer treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>The origin of the signals detected in the dot blot assay for IgE against Bos d TG without apparent α-Gal cross-reactivity remains to be determined.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, in our study we show individual differences between the sensitization profiles of MA and IA patients to different α-Gal-containing analytes.</s><s>Whereas MA patients with a strong history of an α-Gal syndrome often can be confirmed in vitro by the commercially available singleplex ImmunoCAP® analysis, diagnostics of patients with IA and suspected MA is more challenging.</s><s>Having identified the IgE binding pattern associated with MA patients in dot blot, thorough analysis of sera from the IA patient group may lead to the identification of risk-associated IgE binding patterns via dot blot, which is already evaluated in many more IA patients attending our allergy outpatient clinic.</s><s>By a combination of different in vitro analysis techniques for the detection and characterization of IgE against alpha-Gal, such as the introduced dot blot assay system, a more differentiated ImmunoCAP® diagnostic as well as subsequent provocation tests, many more previously underdiagnosed patients with IA can be diagnosed correctly.</s><s>We could show that the CTX ImmunoCAP® provides enhanced sensitivity for some patients with low serum concentration of IgE against α-Gal.</s><s>Thus, it may be concluded that especially these patients (from the IA patient group) benefit from an additional analysis by ImmunoCAP® with CTX.</s></p></div>
