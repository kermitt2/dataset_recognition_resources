<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DiscUssiOn</head><p><s>We compared clinical characteristics and prehospital management between 73 non-resident and 2,378 resident stroke patients in Berlin, for whom a stroke dispatch was activated.</s><s>The main  findings of our study are that, compared to residents, nonresidents (1) were on average 7 years younger, had a lower burden of pre-stroke disability and less severe strokes; (2) had higher thrombolysis rates after adjustment for age, mRS, and NIHSS; and</s></p><p><s>(3) had a significantly shorter symptom onset/LSW-to-alarm time.</s></p><p><s>The different patient characteristics can be explained by a lower proportion of people aged over 65 to engage in tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref> or to commute, and the observation that older age is associated with stroke severity ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) and a higher probability of having had a prior stroke.</s><s>Additionally, due to reduced mobility, people with pre-stroke disability might be less likely to travel, irrespective of their age.</s></p><p><s>With regard to prehospital stroke management, the median difference of symptom onset/LSW-to-alarm times between both groups was 109 min in our cohort.</s><s>Accordingly, non-resident stroke patients were seen by the prehospital stroke team earlier after symptom onset than residents and had an almost twofold higher odds of receiving thrombolysis.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that younger age and higher NIHSS score are associated with shorter prehospital delays <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and non-residents were younger than residents in our study.</s><s>Indeed, considering the significance levels of our results obtained with and without adjustment, the between-group differences of symptom onset/ LSW-to alarm and symptom onset/LSW-to-treatment time are partly, but not fully, explained by age, stroke severity, and prestroke disability.</s><s>More residents than non-residents had an unknown time of symptom onset in our study, which explains the residual between-group difference.</s><s>This imbalance was not only due to differences in age and stroke severity (e.g., inability to respond to questions due to motor aphasia or reduced level of consciousness) but also might be reflective of the fact that non-residents have a higher level of planned activities and more witnessed time while away from home.</s><s>Especially since our study was mainly conducted during daytime (7:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.), non-residents can be expected to be often either at work or visiting Berlin.</s><s>Additional factors that have previously been found to be associated with prehospital delay and that are likely to be distributed unevenly between non-residents and residents are socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref> and the tendency to contact a general practitioner when stroke symptoms occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>We did not have the necessary data to explore the influence of these parameters in more detail.</s></p><p><s>The proportion of strokes with unknown time of symptom onset in our study was 21.9% for non-residents and 46.4% for residents.</s><s>Previous studies have reported rates of approximately 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Determination of time of symptom onset sometimes requires time for additional phone calls with patients' relatives and caregivers whose contact details may not be immediately known.</s><s>Therefore, the fact that our results are solely based on prehospital data may explain the slightly higher rate of stroke with unknown time of symptom onset in our cohort.</s></p><p><s>In agreement with the observation that most touristic trips in Europe are domestic (3), the great majority of non-resident patients (114 of 131) included in our registry lived in Germany.</s><s>Therefore, factors that could become relevant in the context of international travel, such as language barriers, unfamiliarity with the local health-care system, and reluctance to seek medical assistance due to lack of financial resources and/or health insurance, are less likely to have influenced our results.</s><s>Additionally, for residents of Germany, health insurance is mandatory and emergency medical care is free of charge at the point of service <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s><s>It has been estimated that comprehensive health insurance increases utilization of health-care services <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence, our results may not be generalizable to areas with higher proportions of international tourists or different health-care systems.</s></p><p><s>Some limitations have to be considered when interpreting our findings.</s><s>First, in the subgroup of patients with known symptom onset time, our study was limited by low statistical power (high risk of type II error).</s><s>Indeed, post hoc calculations in this subgroup suggested a power of respectively 10 and 11% to obtain statistically significant results in the comparisons of onset-to-alarm times and proportions of thrombolysis between non-residents and residents at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.</s><s>This low observed statistical power can not only be explained by the small number of patients in the non-resident group and the greatly unequal sample sizes (32) but also by the small between-group differences (thrombolysis rates: 35.2 vs. 31.5%,</s><s>median onset-to-alarm time: 25 vs. 26 min).</s><s>Second, we did not include information on vascular risk factors and comorbidities, which may be distributed differentially between non-residents and residents.</s><s>Third, a full set of time intervals was missing for approximately 20% of all patients; however, proportions of missing data were similar for non-residents and residents, and a non-random distribution of missing items between the two groups, which could have introduced bias (differential misclassification), seemed unlikely based on our study design.</s><s>Fourth, we only included patients with suspected stroke for whom an ambulance call was made between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. that were seen by the STEMO team; therefore, our results do not necessarily apply to all patients making an emergency call with symptoms suggesting an acute stroke.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>cOnclUsiOn</head><p><s>In summary, non-residents had a higher thrombolysis rate and shorter symptom onset/LSW-to-alarm time compared to Berlin residents.</s><s>These results can be explained by a lower proportion of patients with unknown time of symptom onset among non-residents, probably reflecting more witnessed stroke events during the daytime.</s></p></div>
