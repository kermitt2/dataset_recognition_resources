well as during regeneration after injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The IGF-I gene spans more than 90 kb of chromosomal DNA and generates three isoforms.</s><s>Alternative splicing of IGF-I pre-mRNA can produce three multiple mRNA species, depending on the inclusion of alternative leader and C-terminal exons <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>All mRNA splice variants contain exons 3 and 4, which encode the mature 70-amino-acid IGF-I peptide consisting of the B, C, A, and D domains.</s><s>All three mRNA splice variants encode C-terminal extensions termed E-domains to denote their positions relative to the BCAD domains of mature IGF-I: mRNAs containing exon 4 spliced to exon 6 are designated as IGF-IEa, mRNAs containing exon 5 spliced to exon 4 have been designated as IGF-IEb, whereas those containing exon 4 spliced to exon 5 and exon 6 are designated IGF-IEc in humans (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Rather than acting in an endocrine fashion, IGF-IEc produced in the body is more likely functioning in a paracrine/autocrine mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>For example, IGF-IEc produced in skeletal muscles in response to mechanical stimuli or damage, functions in skeletal muscles probably as a local muscle growth/repair factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>It has been further suggested that after injury or training locally produced IGF-IEc in muscles is required to activate muscle stem (satellite) cells to divide thereby providing extra nuclei necessary for muscle repair and hypertrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A single injection of MGF-cDNA containing plasmid vector (which corresponds to IGF-I Ec in human) resulted in a 25% increase in the mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area of the injected normal muscle within two weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, IGF-IEc represents a potential drug candidate for the treatment of several neuromuscular disorders.</s><s>However, its potential misuse as doping in sport games has been also identified and therefore the use of IGF-IEc have been prohibited according to the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2005 <ref type="bibr"

the terminal lysine and arginine residues by a histidine (See <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore this unknown substance has been denoted full-length MGF and can be considered as an analog of human IGF-IEc.</s></p><p><s>The insulin-IGF system includes at least four receptors: the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), the IGF-II receptor, the insulin receptor-A (IR-A) and the insulin receptor-B (IR-B).</s><s>Both the IGF-IR and the IRs belong to the family of ligand-activated receptor kinases.</s><s>Binding of a ligand to the extra-cellular alpha subunit of the IGF-IR or the IRs induces the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>When we tested in vitro potency with our in house IGF-IR KIRA assay, full -length MGF at equimolar concentrations in the lower ranges generated less IGF-IR stimulatory activity than recombinant human IGF-I, suggesting that the IGF-IR is less sensitive to full -length MGF than to recombinant human IGF-I.</s><s>However, despite a higher EC50 concentration, at high equimolar concentrations full-length MGF showed a similar maximal potency to activate the IGF-IR than IGF-I (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The IGF-I KIRA assay measures a physiologically meaningful parameter: quantification of the phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the ß-subunits of the IGF-IR.</s><s>Phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of the ß-subunits of the IGF-IR initiates the majority, if not all of the biological effects mediated by the IGF-IR.</s><s>On the other hand, the IGF-IR KIRA assay provides no direct information about intracellular post-receptor effects.</s><s>For example, we do not know whether activation of the IGF-I receptor by full-length MGF results (like human IGF-I) in more mitogenic as opposed to metabolic activity of the IGF-I receptor.</s></p><p><s>The molecular structure of full-length MGF shows considerable homology with IGF-1Ec, which is one of three known IGF-I isoforms, that are naturally occurring in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>.</s><s>The intact molecular weight of full-length MGF is 147, 2 Da lower than that of human IGF-1Ec.</s><s>This discrepancy in molecular weight is due to a slight structural difference between both substances in molecular structure.</s><s>Full-length MGF is one amino acid shorter and contains a histidine residue at the carboxy-terminus instead of arginine and lysine <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Full-length MGF can thus be considered as a pro-IGF-I with slight modifications.</s><s>Our finding that full-length MGF directly stimulates the IGF-IR, challenges the current concept that the E-peptide of pro-IGF-I has to be cleaved off from the IGF-I molecule to become biologically active <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The residence time in vivo of a given glycoprotein is often dependent on its glycosylation status <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, a lack of glycosylation may also reduce the ability of a ligand to activate a receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the glycosylation state of MGF may be an important factor and it has been suggested that glycosylated MGF directly associates with the extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby serving as an alternate additional reservoir of this growth factor: as such glycosylation may attribute to a delayed clearance, while cleavage of the entire E-peptide by extracellular proteases could release active mature IGF-I for receptor binding when needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>However, the full-length MGF molecule we studied appeared to be a pure peptide structure which is not glycosylated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>It also does not show any additional signals or indications for glycan residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Our results support previous observations that IGF-IR stimulatory activity of mature IGF-I and non-glycosylated MGF are similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The stimulatory effects on the IGF-IR in the KIRA assay occurred at relatively high molar concentrations of full-length MGF.</s><s>However, at present no information is available about the in vivo concentrations of MGF at the IGF-I receptor site.</s><s>In the physiological states in the human body MGF probably does not enter the bloodstream in any significant quantity, but remains in the muscular compartment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that the E-peptide may prevent release of MGF into the bloodstream by tethering MGF to the site of synthesis and/or administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>This would help to increase the local actions of MGF <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, the recently reported findings for polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated IGF-I are very interesting: it has been demonstrated that a single intramuscular injection of PEG-IGF-I was more efficacious than systemic administration of PEG-IGF-I or a single intramuscular injection of recombinant human IGF-I for hastening early muscle fiber regeneration and improving muscle function after injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>This latter effect was attributed to a delayed clearance of PEG-IGF-I after intramuscular injection and suggests that molecular modifications near the C terminus of the IGF-I molecule are very important to increase the actions of IGF-I at the tissue level <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Whether full-length MGF in this respect resembles PEG-IGF-I is not clear at present and should be studied.</s></p><p><s>It would be very interesting to determine whether full-length MGF and IGF-I differ in their kinetics of IGF-IR activation.</s><s>However, due to a limited availability of full-length MGF, we could not directly assess IGF-IR activation kinetics of full-length MGF to compare it with IGF-I.</s></p><p><s>It is well established that Human MGF and Goldspink-MGF are synthetic IGF-I E peptide analogues corresponding to the last 24 amino acids of the E domain of the IGF-IEc isoform <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that these E peptides may function as independent growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In our hands, human MGF and Goldspink-MGF in the IGF-IR KIRA assay induced no stimulatory activity of the IGF-IR.</s><s>In line with our findings, it has been found that the E-peptides do not directly induce IGF-IR phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Although in a rodent model, exposure to E-peptides has been shown to increase myoblast proliferation and migration, many of these effects were apparent even when IGF-IR was blocked via a neutralizing antibody, indicating that these E-peptide actions were independent of IGF-IR signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Long-R 3 IGF-I is derived from native IGF-I by replacing the third amino acid in the mature peptide, glutamine, with arginine <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>This substitution gives Long-R 3 IGF-I a &gt;100-fold reduced affinity for IGFBPs without compromising IGF-IR affinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>At both low and high equimolar concentrations, Long -R 3 IGF-I was less potent to activate of the IGF-IR than recombinant human IGF-I.</s><s>However, maximal stimulatory activity of the IGF-IR generated by Long-R 3 IGF (68-fold) was similar to that induced by recombinant human IGF-I and the doseresponse curve of Long-R 3 IGF-I was bell-shaped <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Despite our findings, Long-R 3 IGF-I may still act in vivo as a more potent growth factor than native IGF-I, due to its considerably reduced affinities for the IGFBPs in plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>It has been reported that Long-R 3 IGF-I demonstrated an increased bioavailability and potency at the target tissues due to its faster clearance from blood into the target tissues in comparison to native IGF-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The structures of the IRs and the IGF-IR resemble each other to such an extent that insulin and IGFs can interact with the respective other receptor, although with quite different affinities and actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>This may be also true for IGF-I isoforms.</s><s>Since full-length MGF shows considerable structural similarities with mature IGF-I, we also investigated whether full-length MGF may stimulate the IRs and observed that full -length MGF also stimulated the IR-A and IR-B.</s><s>The IR-A and the IR-B stimulatory activity started at higher concentrations of full-length MGF compared to those inducing IGF-IR stimulatory activity.</s><s>In addition, at equimolar concentrations in the lower range, sensitivity of the IRs to stimulation with full-length MGF was less compared to human insulin.</s><s>However, it is important to note that at high equimolar concentrations similar maximal IR-A stimulating effects were found for full -length MGF and human insulin, however, maximal stimulatory activity achieved for the IR-B was stronger after full-length MGF than by equimolar doses of human insulin.</s><s>In contrast to the above described effects for the IGF-IR, the dose-response curves of full-length MGF for both IRs showed no peak/plateau at the concentrations tested and the stimulation of the IRs progressively increased with higher concentrations of full-length MGF.</s><s>In addition, for both IRs the maximal stimulatory activity induced by full-length MGF apparently was not reached at the highest concentration of full length MGF tested (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A and 4A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although a limitation of this study may be that affinities of the IGF-IR and the IRs for fulllength MGF were not measured, biological responses do not parallel ligand binding and, therefore, are not exclusively determined by the affinity of a particular receptor for that ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the magnitude of a cellular response to a ligand is determined by summation of all the signals generated by each of the occupied receptors, and therefore is related to number of receptors that are activated rather than the fraction of the total receptor pool that is bound by the ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>With the KIRA assays the total amount of autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues of a particular receptor (IGF-IR, IR-A and IR-B) is measured which initiates most if not all of the biological effects of these receptors.</s><s>Therefore, the KIRA assays produce physiologically more relevant information than the assessment of the affinities of the IGF-IR and the IRs As previously discussed for the IGF-IR, both IR KIRA assays do not produce information about intracellular post-receptor events.</s><s>At present we do not know which metabolic and mitogenic responses are induced by activation of the IRs by full-length MGF.</s><s>While it is apparent from our study that full-length MGF induces a phosphorylation pattern of the IR-B, which is significantly different from that of insulin, the potential consequences of this different phosphorylation pattern for the human body in vivo are not yet obvious.</s></p><p><s>At present it is not clear to what extent our in vitro findings about full length MGF can be translated into biological responses of cells in vivo and whether this substance may improve skeletal muscle function and/or hypertrophy.</s><s>New studies in animals should be initiated to gather in vivo information about efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of full-length MGF.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, full-length MGF in vitro at equimolar concentrations in the lower range demonstrated lower activation of the IGF-IR than IGF-I.</s><s>However, despite a higher EC50 concentration, at equimolar concentrations in the higher ranges maximal IGF-IR stimulatory activity achieved by full-length MGF was similar (90-fold) to that after recombinant human IGF-I (82-fold).</s><s>No IGF-IR stimulatory activity was induced by human MGF and Goldspink-MGF, respectively.</s></p><p><s>At high equimolar concentrations similar maximal levels of IR-A stimulating effects were observed for full-length MGF and human insulin, but maximal stimulatory activity achieved for the IR-B was stronger after full-length MGF than after adding equimolar doses of human insulin.</s><s>Both the IRs showed no clear peak/plateau in stimulatory activity and the stimulatory activity of the IRs progressively increased with higher concentrations of full-length MGF.</s></p><p><s>Further research is needed to better understand the actions of full-length MGF in vivo and to place our in vitro findings into the context of the actions of full-length MGF in vivo.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig
