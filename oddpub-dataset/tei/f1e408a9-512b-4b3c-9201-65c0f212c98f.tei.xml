Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we determined to what extent our samples contributed to the discovery of eczema loci and asthma loci in previous GWAS.</s><s>Considering the cases in previous eczema and asthma GWAS, on an average only 10.8 and 11.0%, respectively, were included in the current atopic march study (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">10</ref>).</s><s>It is therefore unlikely that the prominent role of eczema loci in our study was due to a selection bias.</s></p></div>

<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">35</ref> .</s><s>Association between epilepsies and allergic diseases in childhood has recently been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">36</ref> , which may

by a recent study demonstrating selective inhibition of B(0)AT2 by the histamine H1 receptor antagonist loratadine <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">40</ref> , which is clinically used for the treatment of allergic disease.</s><s>Further studies will be necessary to elucidate a potential functional role of this genomic region.</s><s>Interestingly, both novel loci revealed no effect on eczema alone or asthma alone.</s><s>In agreement with these results, they were not found in previous GWAS on either trait and may represent novel disease mechanisms reinforcing the existence of a specific atopic march phenotype.</s></p><p><s>In our study, GWAS loci for eczema ranked significantly higher than asthma loci.</s><s>In addition, we observed a stronger effect of the atopic march loci on eczema alone than on asthma alone for four of the five established allergic disease loci.</s><s>These results suggest that genes triggering eczema are the predominant driver of the atopic march.</s><s>In contrast, the majority of the GWAS loci for asthma seem to be more involved in an eczema-independent phenotype, supporting genetic heterogeneity in asthma susceptibility.</s><s>This finding highlights the role of the skin as the interface between host and environment in shaping local and systemic immune responses that induce chronic inflammation and may affect distant organs in the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41</ref> .</s><s>In mice, it has been demonstrated that enhanced transcutaneous penetration of allergens promotes the formation of allergen-specific IgE antibodies <ref type="bibr"

genetic link between the loss of a skin-specific-protein, cutaneous barrier deficiency, eczema and subsequent asthma development.</s><s>Furthermore, the importance of infantile eczema in subsequent asthma susceptibility is underlined by epidemiological data in the ALSPAC cohort indicating that early eczema confers a 4.3-fold increase in asthma risk (OR 4.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.72-5.01,</s><s>Po0.0001).</s><s>A causal relationship between eczema and this asthma subtype would have important implications for interventional strategies.</s><s>Since no cure for asthma exists, one might speculate that modulation of skin integrity early in infancy could be an effective strategy to prevent not only eczema but also the atopic march in a subset of patients.</s><s>Recently, skin emollient therapy in neonates yielded promising results regarding eczema prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45</ref> .</s><s>However, a long-term effect on asthma in these children still remains to be demonstrated.</s><s>Epidemiological studies demonstrating an increased asthma risk in children with early eczema, clearly support the concept of the atopic march and the phenotype under study <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> .</s><s>In the largest study on the progression of multiple allergic diseases, 60.7% of allergic children developed eczema first <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Of all children with eczema, 86% had it as their first allergic condition, indicating that it is uncommon to develop eczema after asthma or allergic rhinitis.</s><s>The development of all three conditions, eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis was unusual occurring in only 2.3% of all children.</s><s>Therefore, defining the atopic march based on all three allergic diseases may underestimate its prevalence <ref type="bibr">50</ref> .</s><s>Among all children with multiple allergic diseases, the single largest group were those with eczema followed by asthma (38.3%), the phenotype used in our current study.</s></p><p><s>Other atopic march patterns exist as allergic conditions may occur in different orders.</s><s>In addition, since eczema and asthma are common diseases, they may also co-manifest coincidentally.</s><s>Thus, the identification of known eczema and asthma loci in this study may reflect the underlying association with each disease independently.</s><s>In addition, the role of less prevalent allergic manifestations in the atopic march still needs to be resolved.</s><s>For food allergy, mouse models point to a potential involvement in the atopic march <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52</ref> , but robust data from longitudinal cohorts are sparse <ref

study need to be discussed.</s><s>Although most of our study populations selected strict controls by the absence of eczema and asthma, others used population-based controls with unknown disease status.</s><s>Accordingly, the presence of affected individuals among controls may have decreased the power of these studies.</s><s>In addition, we did not use atopy status in our meta-analysis due to missing data in some populations.</s></p><p><s>Where available, atopy data were very heterogeneous between studies regarding age at testing, assay used, number of data points and allergens tested.</s><s>The inclusion of atopic controls may have reduced the power to detect atopy-related genes involved in the atopic march.</s><s>However, homogeneous effects of the atopic march loci across our study populations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) using selected and unselected (population-based) controls pointed to a minor effect of the selection process.</s><s>We did not investigate allergic rhinitis in our study because reliable phenotype data were not available for all study populations.</s><s>As a consequence, our results could be biased towards genes involved in eczema or asthma rather than allergic rhinitis.</s><s>However, the only significant locus identified in GWAS on allergic rhinitis, C11orf30/LRRC32 (ref.</s><s>57), is a known risk factor for eczema-associated asthma and hay fever <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , suggesting that similar mechanisms may be involved in the atopic march from eczema to asthma and from eczema to allergic rhinitis.</s></p><p><s>For the phenotype definition, we required early eczema to have manifested by 3 years of age and childhood asthma by 16 years.</s><s>However, in several populations phenotype data were not available for the complete time periods (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Thus, those individuals who developed eczema and asthma within the missing time window may have been lost as cases.</s><s>Their misclassification as controls is unlikely because this would require that both conditions, eczema and asthma, manifested within the respective missing period.</s><s>In addition, a recall bias in retrospectively collected data can give rise to a loss of cases.</s><s>Although most studies relied on actual or reported doctor's diagnoses, a few studies used a parental report of disease symptoms.</s><s>Again, a loss of power can be expected, but case misclassifications requiring false reports of both eczema and asthma in the same individual are unlikely.</s></p><p><s>Since we used a strict atopic march definition of early-onset eczema and childhood asthma, a relatively small number of cases fulfilled our case definition.</s><s>Using a wider definition of the atopic march (defined as eczema and asthma at any age up to 16 years) nearly doubled the number of cases in the discovery set and in the first replication to 2,075 and 1,591 cases, respectively (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Applying the same quality control criteria and selection thresholds as in the strict definition, identified only five of the seven loci without evidence of additional susceptibility regions (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our study demonstrates that the strict definition of a severe phenotype is a successful approach for studying complex diseases.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our study revealed two novel loci, which are specific for

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>Phenotype definition.</s><s>The term 'atopic march' refers to the sequential manifestations of different allergic diseases such as eczema, asthma and rhinitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58</ref> .</s><s>Typically, eczema is the first allergic disease in infancy, followed by asthma and/or rhinitis in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60</ref> .</s><s>More than 20% of the children with eczema develop asthma, making this the largest group among children with multiple allergic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Since complete longitudinal data were available only for a few study populations, we aimed to approximate the temporal component of the atopic march by using eczema up to the age of 3 years and asthma up to the age of 16 years (strict definition).</s><s>For a total of 12 study populations, six of the discovery set and six of the replication set, the corresponding phenotype data were available (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Another four study populations had no data on early eczema available.</s><s>They were included in a separate analysis using a wider definition of the atopic march (childhood eczema plus asthma up to the age of 16 years).</s><s>Controls were selected for the absence of eczema and asthma if phenotype data were available.</s><s>Four data sets included unselected, population-based controls.</s><s>The phenotype characteristics of each study population are summarized in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>All but one study population of the discovery set had participated in the previous GWAS on asthma performed by the GABRIEL consortium <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61</ref> .</s><s>All study populations were of European ancestry.</s><s>Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians, and all studies were approved by the local ethics committees as indicated in the Supplementary Methods.</s></p><p><s>Genotyping and imputation.</s><s>Genotyping and imputation of the study populations was performed in the context of the GABRIEL consortium or according to the methods described there <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61</ref> , if not otherwise stated.</s><s>Briefly, after genotyping, an ancestry analysis was carried out using EIGENSTRAT2.0</s><s>(ref.</s><s>62) and putative non-European samples were eliminated from subsequent analyses.</s><s>Genotyped SNPs for imputation had to fulfil the following quality control criteria: (1) genotype missing rate o3% in both cases and controls; (2) minor allele frequency Z1% in controls; and (3) consistency with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by a one degreeof-freedom goodness-of-fit test in unselected controls (for case-control study populations) or in the whole population before case-control selection (for study populations derived from population-based cohorts), respectively (P41 Â 10 À 4 ).</s><s>Imputation was carried out with MACH <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">63</ref> or IMPUTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">64</ref> using Hapmap 2 CEU SNPs (release 22, NCBI build 36) as reference.</s></p><p><s>Association analyses.</s><s>In each study population, association between SNPs and disease was analysed by logistic regression using an additive model for genotype dosage.</s><s>Imputed SNPs with a quality score of r 2 o0.8 were filtered out.</s><s>For data sets comprising unrelated and related cases and controls, we used a logistic regression model with robust sandwich estimation of the variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">65</ref> as implemented in the Stata logit function to model clustering of family genotypes.</s><s>A detailed description of the study populations, including phenotype characteristics and genotyping platforms, and software used for imputation and logistic regression analysis is provided in the Supplementary File.</s></p><p><s>Meta-analyses.</s><s>Meta-analyses were carried out with METAL 66 using the inverse variance fixed effects model.</s><s>Combined ORs and 95% CIs were calculated.</s><s>All SNPs with missing data in any of the study populations of the discovery set were excluded.</s><s>For SNPs with a minor allele frequency of o5%, a quality score of r 2 Z0.9 was required in all data sets, for all other SNPs one data set with r 2 o0.9 was allowed.</s><s>In addition, we tested for heterogeneity between cohorts using Cochran's Q statistic and excluded loci with evidence for effect heterogeneity (Po0.05).</s><s>The genomic inflation factor was calculated for each cohort and for the combined analysis.</s><s>We applied a threshold of Po5 Â 10 À 8 to declare an effect as genome-wide significant.</s><s>SNPs with Po1 Â 10 À 4 in the discovery set metaanalysis were selected for replication.</s><s>When multiple associated SNPs were located in the same region, we selected the best SNP per 1-Mb window.</s><s>In total, 54 SNPs were selected and analysed using data from five additional GWAS sets.</s><s>Two of these SNPs, which were significant after correcting for the number of SNPs in the replication set (Po0.05/54 ¼ Po9.3 Â 10 À 4 ;
