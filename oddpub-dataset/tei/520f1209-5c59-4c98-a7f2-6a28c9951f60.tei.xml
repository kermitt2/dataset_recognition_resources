<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Tunga penetrans (Insecta, Siphonaptera, Tungidae) causes severe morbidity among heavily infected humans and animals in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.</s><s>The clinical pathology of tungiasis in animals has never been studied systematically.</s><s>Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January to March 2015, aimed at describing tungiasis-associated clinical pathology in 121 and 20 T. penetrans-infected pigs and dogs, living in nine and five endemic rural villages respectively located in Bugiri District, Busoga, Uganda.</s><s>Results: The parasite load of infected animals ranged from one to 246 (median 8) and one to eight (median 2) in pigs and dogs, respectively.</s><s>In pigs 99.3 % and in dogs 100 % of the lesions were located on feet.</s><s>In pigs, hind legs were significantly more affected than front legs (90.9 % vs. 57.9</s><s>%; p = 0.002) and also had more lesions than the front legs (median 5 vs. 1; p = 0.0001).</s><s>However, in dogs localization of lesions between front and hind legs never differed significantly (front, 50 % vs. hind, 65 %; p = 0.51) and so were the number of lesions (median front = 0.5 vs. median hind = 2; p = 0.7).</s><s>Acute and chronic clinical pathology coexisted.</s><s>The most common disease manifestations in pigs were hoof wall erosions (68.6 %), tissue necrosis of hoof wall and skin (66.1), pain at infection sites (47.9 %), hoof deformity (45.5 %), fissures (44.6 %) and edema (44.6 %).</s><s>In dogs, tungiasis mainly presented with pain at attachment site (80 %), ulcers (55 %), necrosis (30 %) as well as hyperemia and edema (both 15 %).</s><s>One pig had lost dew claws while two had loose detaching claws.</s><s>Despite a lower number of sand fleas, a higher proportion of infected dogs (20 %) than pigs (5.8 %) exhibited functional limb use difficulties (p = 0.05).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>The pattern of clinical manifestations in pigs and dogs were very similar to those reported from affected humans and rats.</s><s>The important morbidity associated with animal tungiasis makes the disease a serious veterinary health problem in sub-Saharan Africa warranting treatment and control for optimal animal production.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study area</head><p><s>The study area has been described before in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly the study was carried out in 10 neighboring rural tungiasis-endemic villages from three parishes of Bulidha sub county, Bugiri District, South Eastern Uganda which were purposively selected because they were known to have a high prevalence of human tungiasis.</s><s>The villages sampled were Makoma 1, Masolya, Busindha, Isakabisolo, Matyama, Busakira, Namungodi, Busanoin Makoma Parish; Nagongera in Bulidha Parish and Kibuye in Wakawaka Parish.</s><s>The area has two rainy seasons which support subsistence arable agriculture among the communities.</s><s>All the roads and paths in the villages are made of murram and over 95 % of the households have non-concrete floors.</s><s>Animal rearing is also on subsistence scale, farmer education services are very limited and parasite control among animals is practiced only occasionally by a few farmers.</s><s>Livestock stay on earthen grounds with no formal housing infrastructures.</s><s>While domestic ruminants such as goats, sheep and cattle are tethered most of the time, pigs are only confined intermittently during the crop growing season and released most of the time during the dry season.</s><s>Dogs, cats and all poultry are left to roam freely throughout the year.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and study population</head><p><s>The principal study design has been described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In brief, this was a cross sectional study performed from January 23 to March 25, 2014 which coincided with the middle to the end of the dry season when tungiasis is particularly abundant.</s><s>All pigs and dogs in the 10 villages which had stayed in the area for at least four weeks and those born in the area (but below four weeks of age) were included in the study if their owners consented.</s><s>Tungiasis-associated morbidity was described for all pigs and dogs with at least one lesion.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical examination of pigs and dogs</head><p><s>All pigs were restrained physically but after temporal physical handling by the owner, some dogs were sedated with xylazine (0.5 mg/kg body weight intramuscularly) and ketamine (7 mg/kg body weight intramuscularly) used with atropine (0.02 mg/kg body weight intramuscularly) to control vomiting.</s><s>The whole body was examined systematically from the head, trunk, tail, ventral abdomen and limbs by parting the hairs, palpation and observation for tungiasis-associated lesions.</s><s>Emphasis was put on the predilection sites of sand fleas, i.e. legs, tail, mammary glands and the testes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The hooves of the pigs and paws of dogs were washed using a brush and water to permit efficient detection of the embedded sand fleas.</s><s>Lesions were staged according to the Fortaleza classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, counted and documented by description and photography.</s></p><p><s>All parasitological and biographical information of infected animals obtained by animal examinations, observations and information from animal owners were recorded on standardized forms.</s><s>Since there were no animal records, age and management related information was obtained by interviewing animal owners.</s><s>Furthermore, body condition score, breed and weight among other related information were obtained by observation and physical examination.</s><s>The body condition scores were determined using the systems described by Kimberly and associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Defra <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for dogs and pigs, respectively.</s><s>Weight of pigs was estimated using a girth tape.</s></p><p><s>Staging of T. penetrans lesions was based on the dynamic features of tungiasis as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Viable lesions of T.penetrans presented as a dark spot with or without pain surrounded by a hyperemic zone (stage 2) or as glassy nodular patches of 3-12 mm in diameter, with a central dark spot which exuded eggs or watery fluid on a gentle touch (stage 3).</s><s>Non-vital lesions were identified as either brown to black slightly raised patches surrounded by a necrotic area (stage 4) or as epidermal circular craters with or without necrotic tissue edges (stage 5).</s></p><p><s>All photographs of the lesions from all T. penetrans-infected pigs and dogs were reviewed daily to understand the morphological alterations at different topographic sites.</s><s>In any animal with at least one lesion, irrespective of size and severity, the clinical pathology was documented.</s></p><p><s>Only morphological changes in close proximity (≤5 mm) of the embedded sand fleas were attributed to tungiasis.</s><s>A cluster of lesions was defined as ≥3 lesions which were not more than 5 mm apart from each other.</s></p><p><s>For morphological identification of sand flea species at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Bio-security (CoVAB), ten and five sand fleas were extracted from 10 pigs and three dogs, respectively.</s><s>Fleas were preserved in 10 % ethanol in the field before morphological analysis in the laboratory.</s><s>Identification of the embedded females was based on features as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>All extracted sand fleas exhibited a clover leaf-like appearance of the chitin of the anterior neosomic abdomen when viewed cranially and hence were identified as T.penetrans <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Data was entered into excel sheets (Microsoft Office, 2007) and validated by checking all entries against all of the original data collection forms.</s><s>Then data was exported to Stata ® Software package, Version 13 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas 77845 USA, stata@stata.com)</s><s>for analysis.</s><s>Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between pairs of continuous groups of variables which were not normally distributed.</s><s>The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to establish if there were differences in the number of lesions in animals between two groups or predilection sites.</s><s>Mid p-exact tests were conducted using the rate2by2.test</s><s>function as implemented in the epitools package in R-software to establish the significance of differences between proportions.</s><s>Only p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical considerations</head><p><s>Study protocols were considered and ethical clearance was granted by the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Bio-security (COVAB) (Ref.</s><s>VAB/ REC/14/101) and the National Council of Science and Technology (Ref.1621).</s><s>The study was conducted in collaboration with the responsible local Veterinary Extension Officers.</s><s>Participation was optional and animal owners provided informed written consent.</s><s>In addition, affected households were briefed on the biology of T. penetrans and an insecticidal wound spray (Supona ® aerosol, Pfizer Laboratories (Pty) Ltd, South Africa) was applied on affected sites and associated wounds of animals.</s></p></div>
