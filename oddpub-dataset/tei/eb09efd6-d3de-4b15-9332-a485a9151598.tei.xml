<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND:</head><p><s>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) is realised in patients with critical or advanced disease of coronary arteries.</s><s>There are different pharmacotherapeutic approaches which are used as management, treatment and preventive therapy in cardiovascular disease or related comorbidities.</s><s>Performing a successful surgery, pharmacotherapy, and increase of bypass patency rate remains a serious challenge.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AIM:</head><p><s>This study aims to analyse the patient characteristics undergoing CABG and evaluation of their drug utilisation rate and daily dosages in the perioperative period.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIAL AND METHODS:</head><p><s>Data were collected from 102 patients in the period 2016-2017 and detailed therapeutic prescription and dosages, patient characteristics were analysed before the operation, after the operation and visit after operation in the Clinic of Cardiac surgery-University Clinical Center of Kosovo.</s></p></div>

target="#b3">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In atherosclerosis, the main mechanism of worsening of the disease remains to inflammatory processes during the atherogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Also, lipid deposits and oxidised phospholipids are involved in many processes such as endothelium dysfunction, activation of adhesive molecules, chemotactic factors which promote interactions between leukocytes and endothelium, tissue factor releases and activation of coagulation cascades up to atherothrombotic formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Epidemiologic studies provided that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and lifestyle with high lipid intake, stress, and sedentary life are the main triggers for the appearance of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Due to this pharmacotherapeutic approaches with antithrombotic, antiaggregant, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxant, antihypertensive, percutaneous coronary interventions and cardiovascular surgeries including coronary artery bypass grafting <ref type="bibr">(CABG)</ref> regarding prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction and critically advanced stages of coronary artery diseases are improving <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Patients with stenosed arteries that undergo CABG are mostly realized with saphenous vein (SV), mammary or radial artery grafts and provides improvement of angina symptoms, better quality of life and survival rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref>, while there is also difference between the type of grafts in terms of susceptibility to atherosclerosis, occlusion, and failure of grafts which mostly included SV as more sensitive to these pathophysiologic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore based on these facts among the main problems which are still appeared in patients undergoing CABG are graft failure and occlusion also related with the atherothrombotic formation, increased vasospastic agents which play a role in early and late phases of these interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The survival rate is higher in left internal mammary artery grafts and radial artery <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are different study approaches regarding management of perioperative symptoms and diseases by interfering in graft tissues pathophysiology which increase CABG patency rate and reduce operation complications.</s><s>These groups of patients are recommended to use multiple pharmacotherapeutic agents to prevent perioperative complications <ref type="bibr"

shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore the strategies for their standardised utilisation of these drugs in CABG are essential factors to reduce the risk of coronary diseases and improving the survival rate of the patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Use of antiaggregant in the early postoperative period have improved the life expectancy of coronary bypass and cardiovascular-related symptoms, reduced graft occlusion

our findings, excluding the lower rate of ACEi or ARBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Other reports after operation have shown similar trends in beta blockers, statin, with lower ACEi/ARBs which also potentiate the necessity for the optimisation of the drug use in the postoperative period <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[39]</ref>.</s><s>A possible explanation regarding lower rates of ACEi/ARBs utilisation may be the normal values of left ventricular ejaculation fraction, even though these values were not higher as previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, one retrospective study was observed by providing the recorded clinical data in the period when patients were admitted and also in the discharge.</s><s>In this study, the use beta blockers, aspirin, and statin were in similar range but with higher ACEi, lower ARBs (only before the operation) compared to our findings.</s><s>It is worth mentioning the fact that utilisation of beta blockers, ACEi, statins were decreasing in the analysed years, and ARBs were increasing in the period before operation whereas after operation beta blockers and statins were decreasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The antiaggregants such as aspirin was regularly used and in a standard dosage and not all patients were

type="bibr" target="#b52">[42]</ref>.</s><s>However, ACEi or ARBs are not used properly in all patients due to normal LVEF in our study.</s><s>Moreover, aldosterone antagonists need to be reevaluated due to their limited use in LVEF &lt; 35% or cardiac insufficiency II-IV patients.</s><s>Statin utilisation was not monitored properly and titrated in our study.</s></p><p><s>Approximate data regarding existing protocol and evidence for management of patients after CABG are also found in other guidelines from American heart association which also relies on the type of evidence and relevant

target="#b49">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Also, the use of amiodarone in the prevention of atrial fibrillation only 24 hours after operation intravenously and in lower dosages is another promising strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Cardiovascular pharmacotherapeutic approaches in diabetes mellitus consisted usage of insulin which was accompanied with a reduction in the period after the operation, probably due to the increased risk of clinical features in patients with CABG <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Also, the antiacids such as IPP or H2 blockers are mainly used as prophylaxis regarding the surgical intervention which is a common indication <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45]</ref> and decreases in the visit after the operation.</s><s>Other drugs such as analgesics including acetaminophen are indicated as needed mostly in postoperative period with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin, acetylcysteine dominated in the period after the

digoxin, trimetazidine, tamsulosin, doxazosin, levotiroksin, fluoxetine, metformin, and ipratropium-budesonide were also founded.</s></p><p><s>In the meantime with our study regarding utilisation and daily dosages, we have also performed experimental studies for the alternative in compounds (arctigenin) for vasorelaxation and decreasing inflammation level in SV tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to this omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were shown to be beneficial in inflammation and contractility in SV tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[48]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are undergoing similar approaches by other groups by investigating endothelin-1 antagonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[49]</ref>, levosimendan <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[50]</ref>, anti-ischaemic agents including ranolazine were shown to improve postoperative fibrillation in patients after CABG <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[40]</ref>, and additional pharmacologic agents which inhibit the vasospasm of coronary grafts <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[51]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The drug utilisation after CABG have shown to be an important factor regarding long-term management of the clinical outcomes, the adherence of this drugs were not satisfactory after the first year after the revascularisation period <ref type="bibr"

this study, the absence of official protocols which are in the procedure of establishment to maintain effective use of drugs may affect drug prescription and utilization, long-term monitoring (more than three months) after CABG, short period of study (for 1-5 years after CABG) and the adherence monitoring after discharge including also clinical outcomes and adverse events could be considered as a limitations of our study.</s><s>Taking this into consideration our work may set the stage for larger investigational studies aimed at evaluating the utilisation and also drug adherence, long-term monitoring including also the long period after the discharge and clinical outcomes and adverse events.</s></p><p><s>In summary in our study, we have found that therapeutic groups such as beta blockers, statins, aspirin, thiazides, nitrates (before the operation), furosemide and spironolactone are the most utilised drugs.</s><s>However, we found low utilisation rate for ACEi, ARBs, clopidogrel, nadroparin, warfarin, xanthines, amiodarone, calcium blockers.</s><s>Daily dosages were different compared to before CABG only in metoprolol, losartan, and
