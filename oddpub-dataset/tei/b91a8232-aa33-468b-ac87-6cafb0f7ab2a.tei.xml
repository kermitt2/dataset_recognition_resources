type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Childhood obesity is a particularly grave concern because obese children are substantially more likely to be obese as adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and to develop obesity-related disorders at earlier ages and of greater severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, once established, obesity is extremely difficult to reverse, underscoring the critical importance of primary prevention.</s></p><p><s>Although the contribution of obesogenic exposures (e.g., suboptimal diet, physical inactivity) to the development of obesity is well established, the magnitude of this effect only partially accounts for obesity risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>There are, for example, large individual differences in susceptibility for weight gain and fat mass accretion upon exposure to an identical degree of excess energy (caloric) intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>The conventional paradigm posits that such individual susceptibility is largely attributable to genetic makeup; however, it is now increasingly evident there is a lot more to this tendency than genetic variation alone [in fact, currently identified genetic variants account for only a very modest proportion of variation in body mass index (BMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>].</s><s>A rapidly growing and convergent body of epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence in humans and animals suggests that the origins of obesity can be traced, in part, to the intrauterine period of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(7)</ref>, at which time the developing fetus responds to suboptimal conditions by producing structural and functional changes in cells, tissues, and organ systems (i.e., the concept of developmental, or fetal, programming of health and disease risk) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(8)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In humans, adipogenesis, the process of adipocyte formation from stem cell precursors, occurs primarily during late fetal (third trimester of gestation) and early postnatal life <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9)</ref>, whereas the ability to form new adipocytes in adulthood is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10)</ref>.</s><s>Several intrauterine conditions have been identified as risk factors for obesity and metabolic dysfunction in the offspring, including maternal obstetric complications (diabetes, hyperglycemia), maternal under-or overnutrition, unhealthy maternal behaviors such as smoking, and exposure to various forms of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We and many others have suggested that glucocorticoids (GCs; cortisol in humans) may play a salient role in this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(16)</ref>.</s><s>First, cortisol, the end product of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, is known to play a key role in cellular differentiation and fetal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(17)</ref> and exert a wide array of metabolic, endocrine, and immune effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Second, the production, bioavailability, and intracellular activity of cortisol, one of the primary biomarkers of the physiologically stressed state, is altered by the same suboptimal conditions that have been shown to program obesity risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, although glucocorticoids play an essential role in normal growth and development, abnormal or inappropriate levels, particularly during sensitive periods, may induce permanent or long-term physiological changes associated with increased obesity risk in later life.</s></p><p><s>In animal models, fetal exposure to glucocorticoids has been experimentally modeled by administration of dexamethasone or by inhibiting 11 b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11b-HSD), an enzyme that regulates the interconversion between cortisol and its inactive metabolite cortisone, thereby protecting the fetus from maternal glucocorticoid overexposure.</s><s>The offspring of these animals have been shown to exhibit increased adiposity and symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance and glucose intolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(22)</ref>.</s><s>In humans, placental corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-a hormone that stimulates fetal and maternal adrenal cortisol production during pregnancy in primates-is positively associated with increased central adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(23)</ref>, as well as with increased catch-up growth velocity in early infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(24)</ref>, which, in turn, is associated with increased obesity risk in later life.</s><s>Moreover, several animal models of stress induction in pregnant females have found that their offspring were heavier and exhibited greater adiposity <ref type="bibr"

primary aim of the current study was to examine the prospective association between maternal cortisol production in early, mid, and late gestation with change in infant body composition (percent fat mass) over the first 6 months of postnatal life.</s><s>We used a state-of-the art ecological momentary assessment protocol to quantify cortisol production over time and across real-life (ecologically

of 60 samples per woman across pregnancy), with electronic verification of time of day of collection of each sample (using the Medication Event Monitoring System® cap device).</s><s>Based on the rationale discussed previously, and the consideration that the third trimester of gestation represents the period of maximal fetal fat accretion (9), we specifically hypothesized that the effects of maternal cortisol on infant adiposity would be most pronounced during the third trimester.</s><s>We focused on change in percent fat mass over the early postnatal period of life as the primary outcome of interest because several studies suggest that infant growth velocity, and particularly the magnitude of increase in fat mass during early infancy, is among the most reliable and valid predictors of subsequent childhood obesity risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref>.</s><s>We used dual-energy X-ray

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cortisol sample collection protocol</head><p><s>Pregnant women collected saliva samples using a Salivette sampling device (Salimetrics, Carlsbad, CA) for the assessment of cortisol concentrations immediately and 30 minutes postawakening, and at 1200 hours, 1600 hours, and 2000 hours, for 4 consecutive days in early (13 6 2.0 [mean 6 standard deviation (SD)]-week gestation, T1), mid (24 6 1.4-week gestation, T2), and late pregnancy (30 6 1.2-week gestation, T3).</s><s>Thus, each woman collected five saliva samples per day, on 12 days during pregnancy, resulting in a total of 60 samples per woman across pregnancy (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for cortisol-sampling scheme).</s><s>Because previous studies have shown there are weekend-weekday differences in the cortisol-awakening response (34), 2 weekend days and 2 weekdays were selected for sampling to capture a wide range of intraindividual variation in pregnant women's cortisol levels.</s><s>Exact time of saliva sampling was monitored using a Medication Event Monitoring System® (Aardex Group, Union City, CA).</s><s>Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating and drinking during the first hour after awakening, and, after each saliva sample collection, to store the swab in a plastic tube labeled with the designated sampling time.</s><s>Compliance with the saliva-sampling protocol was very high; only 2.1% of the 4080 samples (5 saliva samples/d 3 4 days 3 3 time points during pregnancy 3 68 subjects) were not collected.</s></p><p><s>For each sampling day, total cortisol output was estimated using the area under the curve (AUC) with respect to ground <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(35)</ref>.</s><s>AUCs were then adjusted for total time between the awakening sample and the last sample of the day [i.e., expressed as cortisol production per hour (mg/dL/h)].</s><s>Each of the 4-day AUCs was averaged and residualized for gestational age at collection (to account for effects of gestational age on cortisol production) for each of the three pregnancy assessments in early, mid, and late gestation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>Change in maternal cortisol AUCs from T1 to T3 was examined using repeated measure analysis of variance.</s><s>Separate linear regression models were run to examine the association between maternal cortisol and the following outcomes: %BF at birth, %BF at 6 months of age, and change in %BF from 1 to 6 months of age.</s><s>These outcomes were characterized from the DXA-based measures as well as from the weight-for-lengthbased measures.</s></p><p><s>To determine stage-of-gestation-specific effects of maternal cortisol on our primary outcome (infant adiposity), we used adjusted T2 and T3 cortisol AUC measures for the conditional effect of cortisol production in earlier gestation on cortisol production in subsequent stages of gestation.</s><s>We suggest this approach is more valid than the simpler alternative of considering the unadjusted cortisol values at the different time points across gestation because the unadjusted values do not account for the observation that cortisol production at later time points in gestation is, in part, conditioned by cortisol production at earlier time points.</s><s>Maternal cortisol production across the course of pregnancy exhibits three characteristics.</s><s>First, the state of pregnancy produces a progressive and approximately linear increase in maternal cortisol production over gestation.</s><s>The average cortisol AUCs in our study population in the late first (T1), midsecond (T2), and early third (T3) trimesters are 0.232 6 0.122, 0.258 6 0.099, and 0.317 6 0.101 mg/dL/h (6SD), respectively, indicating a ;1.37-fold increase from early to late gestation.</s><s>Second, there is substantial between-subject variability in cortisol production at and across the 3 time points in early, mid, and later gestation (as evident from the aforementioned SD estimates relative to the means).</s><s>Third, the cortisol measures at T1, T2, and T3 are not independent.</s><s>There is substantial, but not complete, withinsubject stability in cortisol production across gestation, with correlations ranging between r = 0.403 and 0.502 (all P values , 0.001).</s><s>The intraclass coefficient of cortisol production across gestation (proportion of total variation in cortisol that is attributable to variation between subjects, or the extent to which measures on the same subject across time are correlated after accounting for the gestational age effect) is 0.418, indicating greater between-subject variability relative to within-subject across time (gestation) variability.</s><s>This provides the basis for examining stage-of-gestation-specific effects of cortisol.</s><s>The T1 cortisol AUC effect is interpreted as the effect of cortisol production in early gestation on infant adiposity.</s><s>The T2 cortisol AUC effect is interpreted as the effect of cortisol production in midgestation accounting for cortisol production in early gestation on infant adiposity.</s><s>And the T3 cortisol AUC effect is interpreted as the effect of cortisol production in late gestation, accounting for cortisol production in early and midgestation on infant adiposity.</s></p><p><s>All analyses accounted for the potential effects of key pregnancy, birth, and postnatal maternal and child characteristics, including an estimate of maternal sociodemographic status (annual total household income), prepregnancy BMI, parity, presence of gestational diabetes, infant birth weight, gestational age at birth, infant sex, and infant feeding status.</s><s>Additional analyses stratified by infant sex were performed to examine whether effects differed in male and female infants.</s><s>Diagnostics were performed to assess the validity of standard linear regression assumptions.</s><s>No extreme departures from general assumptions were observed, and no observations were removed from the analysis.</s><s>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v22 (IBM, Armonk, NY), and the statistical significance level was set at a = 0.05.</s></p></div>

maternal cortisol production in the later stage of pregnancy (conditioned on prior early and midgestation cortisol concentrations) was positively associated with the magnitude of infant %BF change over the first 6 months of postnatal life.</s><s>The effect was significant after adjusting for the effects of other established pregnancy, birth, and postnatal maternal and infant factors associated with infant adiposity.</s><s>The effect was evident in female and male infants.</s><s>The magnitude of the effect was substantial, with the maternal third-trimester cortisol measure independently accounting for ;14% of the variance in infant body fat increase over the first 6 months of postnatal life.</s><s>The potential clinical significance of this finding is underscored by the fact that several studies suggest that growth velocity, and particularly the increase in fat mass during early infancy, is among the most reliable predictors of childhood obesity risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Infant weight-for-length-based estimate of body composition was unrelated to any of the maternal cortisol in pregnancy measures (and only modestly to DXA-based measures).</s><s>This finding underscores the importance, particularly in the context of fetal programming of childhood obesity, of using direct measures of infant body composition rather than relying on indirect proxy measures.</s></p><p><s>The observation that we found an effect of maternal cortisol concentrations on change in %BF from 0 to 6 months and on %BF at 6 months, but not on %BF at birth, suggests that in utero cortisol exposure may program adipose tissue development such that when exposed to ex utero energy substrate, adipocytes store a greater proportion of excess energy substrate as fat (rather than expend excess energy by heat production), which, in turn,  <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38)</ref>].</s><s>Cortisol, acting as a catabolic hormone, induces several processes leading to increased concentrations of blood glucose through the process of gluconeogenesis.</s><s>It is, therefore, possible that the hormonal changes in the fetal compartment induced by elevated levels of cortisol in the maternal and fetal circulation could contribute to increased glucose concentration that downregulates mitochondrial efficiency, resulting in a higher propensity to store excess energy rather than expend it.</s><s>Converging evidence from animal and human studies suggests that glucocorticoid exposure during fetal development may promote adipogenesis.</s><s>Glucocorticoids have both lipolytic and adipogenic effects, depending on the concentration, duration, and type of glucocorticoid exposure.</s><s>Short-term administration of synthetic GC induces adipose tissue lipolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40)</ref>.</s><s>However, prolonged exposure to GC promotes adiposity, as seen in patients with Cushing's syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(41)</ref> or in those receiving treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(42)</ref>.</s><s>During adipose tissue development, glucocorticoids stimulate the differentiation of adipose precursor cells and seem to enhance terminal differentiation of adipocytes, depending on the concentration of glucocorticoids and the presence of insulin <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44)</ref>.</s><s>A rodent study of adipogenesis that used both in vitro and in vivo glucocorticoid exposure reported that in vitro GC exposure induced an increase in the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner,  and that in vivo exposure (implantation of corticosterone pellets) produced greater visceral adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(45)</ref>.</s><s>Several porcine studies also have investigated the effects of hydrocortisone administration during fetal development.</s><s>Hypophysectomized pig fetuses were treated with hydrocortisone, and the proportion of preadipocytes in cell cultures derived from these fetuses was double that of untreated fetuses <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(46)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the responsiveness of preadipocytes to glucocorticoids increases progressively with fetal age <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(47)</ref>, suggesting that the later stage of gestationwhich also is the period in which fetal adipogenesis is at its peak-may be a particularly sensitive period for programming of adipocytes by glucocorticoid exposure.</s><s>Consistent with this notion, we found an effect of maternal cortisol on infant adiposity during only the third trimester, and findings of two studies that showed that maternal CRH concentrations are associated with increased child obesity risk also report this effect during the late second and third trimesters <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, the literature supports our finding that exposure to inappropriate concentrations of glucocorticoids, particularly during the sensitive developmental window in later gestation, may contribute to higher adiposity and subsequent obesity risk.</s><s>Implicit in human studies of maternal cortisol in pregnancy, including this study, is the premise that cortisol levels in the maternal compartment are an indicator of fetal glucocorticoid exposure.</s><s>This premise is supported by several plausible pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(48)</ref>, as follows: fetal exposure to maternal cortisol is regulated by the placental enzyme, 11b-HSD2, which oxidizes cortisol to its inactive form cortisone <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Because placental 11b-HSD2 serves as only a partial barrier, some proportion of active maternal cortisol does pass through the placenta into the fetal compartment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(50)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, many adverse intrauterine conditions that have been associated with impaired childhood obesity also have been associated with a downregulation of placental 11b-HSD2 activity, including maternal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(51)</ref>, infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(52)</ref>, and proinflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(53)</ref>.</s><s>Another plausible pathway by which maternal cortisol can produce elevations in fetal cortisol is by stimulating and thereby increasing the production of placental CRH <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55)</ref>, which is known to act on the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and stimulate adrenal steroid biosynthesis.</s><s>Finally, a small number of human studies that have obtained paired maternal and fetal plasma samples during gestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(56)</ref>, or paired maternal and cord blood samples at delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(57)</ref>, have reported significant correlations between maternal and fetal/newborn concentrations of cortisol.</s></p><p><s>Strengths of our present study include the prospective design with repeated measures of maternal cortisol over gestation (total of 60 samples per women), the assessment of free (biologically active) cortisol concentrations in saliva, and the assessment of infant adiposity with a reliable, validated method (DXA).</s><s>Replication in an independent cohort is warranted, along with future studies that incorporate measures of metabolic function, mitochondrial activity, and differentiation between white and brown adipose tissue depots and also perform longitudinal follow-up to quantify changes in adiposity from birth into infancy to childhood and beyond, along with the concurrent characterization of other infant and child phenotypes of interest.</s></p><p><s>To conclude, greater maternal cortisol concentration in the early third trimester of gestation (conditioned upon cortisol in early and midgestation) was significantly associated with higher infant adiposity.</s><s>Questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect and the nature of potential interactions with other biological and environmental processes.</s><s>However, the current finding represents an important advance because it adds evidence in humans to support the role of glucocorticoids in fetal programming of obesity risk.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
