<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P</head><p><s>ostoperative wound complications are a common occurrence after open abdominal surgery and include surgical site infections (SSIs), seroma or hematoma formation, and wound dehiscence.</s><s>Surgical site infections constitute 36% of all health care-associated infections in the United States alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and are directly attributable to more than US $1.6 billion in costs and 1 million extra hospital days in affected patients, 2 thus representing a substantial health economic burden.</s><s>Colorectal surgery is associated with the highest rate of SSI (â‰¤45%) 3 owing to the inherent contaminated nature of the surgery.</s><s>The net outcomes of SSI include prolonged hospital stays, delay in adjuvant treatment, potential development of incisional hernias, and ultimately a decrease in patient quality of life. <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref></s><s>The cause of SSI is multifactorial, resulting from an interplay between patient-related, environmental, and surgical factors.</s><s>As such, traditional care bundles aim to target these different components and include the use of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and aseptic surgical technique, maintenance of intraoperative normothermia, and preoperative optimization of patient risk factors. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s>However, these measures have failed to alter the incidence of SSI substantially. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref></s><s>aparoscopic surgery has been demonstrated to result in a significantly lower incidence of SSI compared with open surgery 9,10 ; however, not all patients are suited for this approach.</s><s>Therefore, novel preventive measures are needed to abrogate the development of SSI after open surgery.</s></p><p><s>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) consists of the continuous delivery of negative pressure to the wound bed via a vacuum device, thereby removing excess tissue edema and promoting granulation tissue formation. <ref type="bibr">11</ref></s><s>Although initially used solely in open wounds, 11 use of NPWT has recently been extended to include closed surgical incisions.</s><s>Numerous studies in orthopedic <ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> and cardiothoracic 14 surgery have demonstrated decreased SSI rates with the use of NPWT in closed incisions.</s><s>Commercially available NPWT devices include a vacuum-assisted closure device (VAC; KCI) and the more recent disposable incision management system (PREVENA; KCI) and pocket-sized NPWT device (PICO; Smith and Nephew).</s><s>The PREVENA and PICO devices have been simplified such that they consist of a single-use battery-powered device and an easy-to-apply wound dressing with or without a small portable canister to collect the absorbed fluid.</s><s>A recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">15</ref> showed that NPWT decreased wound infection rates and seroma formation compared with nonpressure, standard wound dressings.</s><s>However, most of the studies included in the latter study evaluated orthopedic procedures, whereas colorectal procedures were not assessed.</s><s>Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association of prophylactic NPWT in closed laparotomy wounds in general and colorectal surgery, compared with conventional surgical dressings.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. <ref type="bibr">16</ref></s><s>We did not publish a prior protocol for this review.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility Criteria</head><p><s>We searched for all studies that directly compared NPWT with standard dressings for closed laparotomy wounds in general and/or colorectal surgery.</s><s>Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies were eligible for inclusion.</s><s>Patients undergoing elective and emergency laparotomies were included.</s><s>We excluded unpublished reports and studies that examined NPWT (or standard nonpressure) dressings only, without a comparator group.</s><s>Studies that evaluated the use of NPWT in open abdominal incisions were excluded, as were studies that involved placement of foreign material (eg, mesh, drain) in the subcutaneous space, owing to these factors being confounding variables in the development of postoperative wound complications.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search Strategy</head><p><s>The online literature was searched using the following combination of medical subject heading terms: "laparotomy incisions" OR "closed laparotomy" AND "negative pressure wound therapy" OR "negative pressure dressings."</s><s>Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar were searched without any language restrictions.</s><s>The search was performed from inception until December 2017, with the last search performed on December 31.</s><s>The titles and abstracts of citations were individually reviewed by 2 authors (S.M.S. and K.M.), and full texts of suitable studies were retrieved.</s><s>Disagreement was resolved by discussion, and if the question remained unsettled, the opinion of the senior author was sought.</s><s>The bibliographies of recovered studies were further assessed for potential additional publications suitable for inclusion.</s><s>The primary end point for this review was SSI.</s><s>Secondary end points included seroma formation and wound dehiscence rates.</s><s>described, <ref type="bibr">17</ref> and the odds ratio (OR) was estimated with its variance and 95% CI.</s><s>The prevailing heterogeneity between ORs for the comparable outcomes between different studies was calculated using the I 2 inconsistency test that depicts the percentage of total variation across studies and reflects heterogeneity rather than chance.</s><s>The absence of statistical heterogeneity is indicated by a value of 0%, whereas larger values indicate increasing heterogeneity.</s><s>The methodologic robustness of included studies was determined using the Downs and Black scale, 18 a validated tool for assessing randomized and nonrandomized studies.</s><s>The scale consists of 27 items evaluating study reporting and external and internal validity and power, with a maximum assigned score of 32 (highest assessment).</s><s>However, we were unable to assess publication bias, because we included fewer than 10 studies in the final analysis.</s><s>Analyses were performed using RevMan software (version 5.3; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study demonstrates that the use of NPWT in closed laparotomy incisions for general and colorectal surgery is associated with a reduced incidence of SSI, with no difference in seroma or wound dehiscence rates, compared with nonpressure surgical dressings.</s><s>On sensitivity analysis, focusing purely on colorectal procedures and excluding general surgery proce-dures, the results still favored NPWT in regard to SSI development.</s><s>Our findings must be construed with caution, however, bec ause the studies have ant clinic al heterogeneity.</s><s>Most important, different NPWT devices with different pressure settings (range, âˆ’75 to âˆ’125 mm Hg) and dissimilar duration of application (4-7 days) were used across studies.</s><s>Although no evidence yet suggests that longer duration of NPWT therapy is superior with regard to wound outcomes, further research is warranted to investigate this possibility.</s><s>The use of perioperative antibiotic therapy also differed among studies, with some studies continuing therapy postoperatively when required <ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">33</ref> and others 36 only administering a prophylactic dose at induction.</s><s>Other studies <ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">38</ref> did not explicitly report use of antibiotics.</s><s>Mechanical bowel preparation was used in 1 study only 36 and may also have positively swayed the subsequent SSI rates.</s><s>Finally, in the study by Bonds et al, <ref type="bibr">35</ref> significantly fewer patients receiving NPWT underwent emergency surgical procedures compared with the control group.</s><s>Emergency surgery, together with immunosuppression, obesity, malnutrition, and malignant disease are associated with a higher risk of SSI 41 and a higher likelihood of stoma formation.</s></p><p><s>Inclusion and exclusion criteria

ries.</s><s><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">37</ref> However, in the nonrandomized study by Blackham et al, 36 significantly fewer clean wounds and more clean contaminated wounds were included in the NPWT cohort than in the control group because the authors used NPWT in patients who were at high risk for SSI, thus reflecting selection bias.</s><s>Wound complications remain common after laparotomy incisions, especially after emergency surgery. <ref type="bibr">42</ref></s><s>Various methods of wound closure techniques 43 (eg, delayed primary closure) have been described in an attempt to decrease SSI rates.</s><s>However, healing by secondary intention is labor intensive and costly.</s><s>Prophylactic NPWT has proved to have a positive association in open incisions but may also confer benefits in closed surgical incisions.</s><s>Negative pressure wound therapy provides stability to the closed incision by redistributing lateral tension and increasing the amount of force required for wound disruption. <ref type="bibr">44</ref></s><s>In addition, porcine models of incisional NPWT have demonstrated enhanced lymphatic clearance from the subcutaneous dead space and an associated reduction in hematoma and seroma formation. <ref type="bibr">45</ref></s><s>Although standard occlusive wound dressings effectively separate the incision from the hospital environment, they lack the additional benefits of wound stability and improved lymphatic clearance.</s><s>Animal models of NPWT have demonstrated an enhanced microvascular blood flow and an improved partial pressure of oxygen in the wound environment. <ref type="bibr">46</ref></s><s>Furthermore, the distinct molecular mechanisms through which NPWT improves wound healing are also being unraveled.</s><s>Local concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1Î² are significantly reduced with NPWT application, 47 whereas concentrations of interleukin-8, a proangiogenic factor, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor are increased. <ref type="bibr">48</ref></s><s>Negative pressure wound therapy appears to promote a shift to an anti-inflammatory phenotype at the molecular level, culminating in neovascularization, extracellular matrix regeneration, and deposition of granulation tissue. <ref type="bibr">49</ref></s><s>he optimal duration of therapy for NPWT as well as the optimal suction pressure on a closed incision has yet to be determined.</s><s>Different devices harbor varying recommendations regarding duration of application and pressure settings (eg, VAC and PREVENA recommend a pressure setting of âˆ’125 mm Hg, whereas that of PICO is âˆ’80 mm Hg).</s><s>Further research is required to investigate these factors.</s></p><p><s>The major drawback associated with NPWT use is cost.</s><s>These costs could be justified if NPWT use reduced SSI rates by at least 15%, according to Heard et al. <ref type="bibr">50</ref></s><s>With regard to length of hospital stay, the new disposable, user-friendly, pocketsize devices allow patients to be safely discharged home with the device, without the cumbersomeness associated with conventional NPWT canisters.</s><s>Although not reported as an end point in our study, length of stay was significantly shorter in the NPWT cohort on pooled analysis of data from 4 studies (mean, âˆ’0.76 days; 95% CI, âˆ’1.16 to âˆ’0.37 days; P &lt; .001).</s><s>Although NPWT application to closed wounds is largely associated with minimal unwanted effects, minor skin irritation, discoloration, and/or ecchymosis may be sometimes encountered.</s><s>However, these effects resolve with discontinuation of the treatment.</s><s>Polyurethane foam, which forms part of the VAC and PREVENA systems, may cause excoriation and blistering if applied directly to the skin; however, the NPWT dressings come with a nonadherent layer for application between the foam and the skin to abrogate these adverse effects. <ref type="bibr">51,</ref><ref type="bibr">52</ref></s><s>mitations Our study is not without limitations.</s><s>Most studies assessed were nonrandomized, with an inherent risk of bias.</s><s>Different NPWT devices were used, each with varying recommendations regarding optimal pressure settings and duration of application.</s><s>However, all of them were included together in this quantitative meta-analysis.</s><s>Also, we did not perform an economic evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard surgical dressings.</s><s>In addition, we were unable to evaluate elective and emergency surgery outcomes separately owing to insufficient data reported in the studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Colorectal surgical procedures endure the highest rates of SSI, reported to be as high as 45%, 3,6 despite established prophylactic measures such as wound protectors, maintenance of normoglycemia perioperatively, and appropriate antibiotic selection.</s><s>Moreover, the presence of a stoma has been shown to be an independent risk factor for postoperative SSI development. <ref type="bibr">53</ref></s><s>herefore, NPWT use in the colorectal surgical population may be beneficial in the setting of a stoma, not only by isolating the wound but also by promoting effective wound healing.</s><s>Two RCTs 28,29 are currently investigating the role of NPWT in elective, open colorectal surgery but have not been published yet.</s><s>Further research is required to determine the wound category (clean vs clean contaminated vs contaminated vs dirty) in which NPWT has the greatest benefits before recommending its routine use in surgical practice.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Meta-analysis of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Rates Between Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) and Standard Dressings</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
