<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>SMTP-7 (Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol-7) is a small molecule that promotes thrombolysis and suppresses inflammation possibly through plasminogen modulation and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibition, respectively.</s><s>Here, we demonstrate an efficacy of SMTP-7 in a severe embolic stroke model in monkeys.</s><s>The middle cerebral artery was embolized by an autologous blood clot.</s><s>Saline, SMTP-7, or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 5 in each group) was given after 3 hours, and neurologic deficit scoring and infarct characterization were performed after 24 hours.</s><s>Hemorrhagic infarct-accompanied premature death was observed for two animals in t-PA group.</s><s>SMTP-7 treatment significantly reduced the sizes of infarct by 65%, edema by 37%, and clot by 55% compared to saline treatment.</s><s>Plasma levels of the products of plasminogen activation (plasmin-α 2 -antiplasmin complex) and sEH reaction (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid) in SMTP-7 group were 794% (P &lt; 0.05) and 60% (P = 0.085) compared to saline group, respectively.</s><s>No significant changes in the plasma levels of MMP-9, CRP, MCP-1, and S100B were found.</s><s>There was an inverse correlation between plasmin-α 2 -antiplasmin complex level and infarct volume (r = 0.93, P &lt; 0.05), suggesting a role of thrombolysis in the SMTP-7 action to limit infarct development.</s><s>In conclusion, SMTP-7 is effective in treating severe embolic stroke in monkeys under conditions where t-PA treatment tends to cause hemorrhagic infarct-associated premature death.</s></p></div>
