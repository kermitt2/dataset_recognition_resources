<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Bone is a unique organ able to regenerate itself after injuries.</s><s>This regeneration requires the local interplay between different biological systems such as inflammation and matrix formation.</s><s>Structural reconstitution is initiated by an inflammatory response orchestrated by the host immune system.</s><s>However, the individual role of T cells and B cells in regeneration and their relationship to bone tissue reconstitution remain unknown.</s><s>Comparing bone and fracture healing in animals with and without mature T and B cells revealed the essential role of these immune cells in determining the tissue mineralization and thus the bone quality.</s><s>Bone without mature T and B cells is stiffer when compared to wild-type bone thus lacking the elasticity that helps to absorb forces, thus preventing fractures.</s><s>In-depth analysis showed dysregulations in collagen deposition and osteoblast distribution upon lack of mature T and B cells.</s><s>These changes in matrix deposition have been correlated with T cells rather than B cells within this study.</s><s>This work presents, for the first time, a direct link between immune cells and matrix formation during bone healing after fracture.</s><s>It illustrates specifically the role of T cells in the collagen organization process and the lack thereof in the absence of T cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>inTrODUcTiOn</head><p><s>Bone is capable of regeneration, but the process that leads to scarless restoration of form and function is highly complex and prone to failure (1).</s><s>Even today delayed and non-union following bone injury represent a clinical problem that results in strongly reduced quality of life for affected patients (2).</s><s>Despite the progress in characterizing molecular and cellular elements of the bone regeneration cascade, the distinct aspects that are altered in compromised patients remain so far unclear.</s><s>The need to understand the correlation of systemic diseases that influence the immune reaction to bone healing remains.</s></p><p><s>Only recently the tight interplay of the skeletal and immune system has been described and recognized as a key element of the bone healing cascade (3).</s><s>The current understanding of this interplay, however, is rather controversially discussed.</s><s>On one hand, lymphopenic mice display a seemingly better healing after injury (4).</s><s>On the other hand, several studies attribute either a positive or negative role to T and B cells in bone biology, autoimmunity, and fracture repair.</s><s>Activated T cells are responsible for causing bone loss during rheumatoid arthritis (5) and postmenopausal osteoporosis (6), and CD8 + memory/effector T cells have been linked to delayed bone healing <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is also known that fracture repair starts with a proinflammatory reaction which is essential for triggering the healing cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(8)</ref>, that macrophages are essential for successful bone regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(9)</ref>, that osteoblast maturation is triggered by T-lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(10)</ref>, and that regulatory T cells cause higher bone mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(11)</ref> and enhance bone repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(12)</ref>.</s><s>B and T cells are producers of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) influencing the osteoclastogenesis, and they are present in high numbers during the remodeling process that reorganizes bone structure toward its final mechanical strength and competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(13)</ref>.</s><s>The above-described detrimental or beneficial effects address different phases of bone formation and healing, but their detailed interplay remains so far unknown.</s><s>Specifically, the distinct role of T and B cells during bone healing appears to be unclear.</s><s>From previous experiments, we could identify that the absence of mature B and T lymphocytes accelerated fracture healing (4).</s></p><p><s>In this work, we ascertain whether such changes in bone repair are dependent on either T or B cells.</s><s>Furthermore, we analyzed the implications of a changed matrix formation on the quality of newly generated bone and on the underlying osteoblast activity.</s></p></div>
