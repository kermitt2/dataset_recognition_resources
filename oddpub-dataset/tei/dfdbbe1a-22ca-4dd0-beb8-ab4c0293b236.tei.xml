<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge of correct HBV infection status</head><p><s>Self-reported and laboratory-tested HBV infection status were concordant in 71% (n = 1463), indicating correct knowledge of their own HBV infection status.</s><s>Among study participants, 9.3% (n = 190) stated that they did not know their HBV infection status.</s><s>Among the participants who had a past or current HBV infection, 41% (n = 209/511) were unaware of their infection.</s><s>Among all study participants, 11% (n = 233) thought they had been or were currently infected with HBV, although their laboratory results indicated neither previous vaccination nor contact with HBV (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors associated with HBV infection status</head><p><s>In the UVA, participant age !25 years (reference: &lt;25 years), injecting drugs for more than 10 years, using stimulant drugs in the past 30 days, and ever having been incarcerated or in opioid substitution therapy (OST), were significantly associated with current/past HBV infection (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the HBV   infection status differed significantly between the study cities.</s></p><p><s>Participants injecting drugs in Munich and Hanover more often had a current/past HBV infection compared to participants from the other cities.</s><s>Migrant status, ever having been homeless, and condom use during the last vaginal/anal intercourse were not associated with HBV infection status in the UVA.</s><s>Participants who stated either unsafe use or no intravenous drug use in the past 30 days (reference: no unsafe use) had significantly lower odds of having a current/past HBV infection.</s></p><p><s>In the MVA, study participant age !40 years (reference: &lt;25 years), injecting drugs for more than 10 years, having used stimulant drugs in the past 30 days, being a first-generation migrant (reference: non-migrant), and having ever been homeless was associated with higher odds of having a current/past HBV infection.</s><s>As in the UVA, the study city was also significantly associated with the HBV status.</s></p><p><s>Incarceration, unsafe use, OST experience, and condom use during the last vaginal/anal intercourse were not significantly  associated with being or having been infected with HBV in the MVA (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge of correct HBV vaccination status</head><p><s>Among participants with no laboratory-confirmed current/past HBV infection, 45% (n = 702) of self-reported and laboratory-tested HBV vaccination status results were concordant, indicating correct knowledge of their HBV vaccination status.</s><s>Among participants, 13% (n = 205) stated that they did not know their HBV vaccination status.</s><s>Falsely assuming not being vaccinated against HBV was the case for 15% (n = 239) of participants.</s><s>Among participants with neither vaccine-induced nor infection-induced detectable antibodies against HBV, 26% (n = 407) stated that they had been vaccinated against HBV (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting of last HBV vaccination</head><p><s>Among participants who reported having been vaccinated against HBV (n = 938), 641 answered the question about the setting or place of their last vaccination.</s><s>The most frequently reported settings were medical doctors without addiction therapy, e.g.</s><s>general practitioners (34%), OST services (23%), and hospitals (17%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors associated with HBV vaccination status</head><p><s>The UVA showed that injecting drugs in Berlin, belonging to age group 25-39 years, having a high education level, ever having been incarcerated, and never having been in OST, were significantly associated with testing negative for vaccine-induced HBV antibodies (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</s><s>In the MVA, participants who injected drugs in Berlin, belonged to the age group 25-39 years (reference: &lt;25 years), and had a high education level (reference: low education level) were significantly associated with not having vaccineinduced HBV antibodies.</s><s>No association was found in the MVA for incarceration and OST (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The HBV seroprevalence among PWID in this study was about five times higher than that in the general population in Germany, confirming PWID as an important risk group for HBV <ref type="bibr">(Poethko-Muller et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, despite the existing recommendations of STIKO for the vaccination of PWID against HBV, neither vaccine-induced antibodies nor any natural immunity from past HBV infection were detected in 43% of participants, therefore leaving them at risk of infection.</s><s>This suggests that the German vaccination recommendation for PWID and other groups at increased risk of HBV infection has not been reaching this group sufficiently.</s><s>It is noteworthy that the study participants often had several indications for HBV vaccination besides intravenous drug use, e.g.</s><s>HIV infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, or incarceration experience.</s><s>However, young study participants (&lt;25 years of age) showed a higher proportion of vaccine-induced immunity and a lower prevalence of HBV infection than those in the older age groups, indicating that they had already been covered by the general vaccination recommendation for infants implemented in 1995.</s><s>Catch-up campaigns for older children were conducted to immunize children &lt;19 years of age, but they were not systematically implemented and conducted on a large scale.</s><s>In line with this, a higher proportion of vaccine-induced immunity among those aged 25-39 years was not observed; this age group represents a population that might have benefited from the general vaccination recommendation in childhood.</s></p><p><s>In this study, age !40 years and duration of intravenous drug use of more than 10 years was significantly associated with current/past HBV infections.</s><s>This finding is biologically plausible, as it correlates with longer lifetime exposure to HBV and is in good agreement with several other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Removille et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edeh and Spalding, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Further, first-generation migrants have higher odds of current/past HBV infection than non-migrants, similar to the results of the national German children and adolescents survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cai et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This could be explained either by a higher prevalence of HBV or less effective HBV vaccination programmes in the country of origin, or limited access to HBV vaccination in Germany due to language or other barriers or lack of health insurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lutgehetmann et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Ever having been in OST was not significantly associated with HBV infection status in the MVA and indicates that opportunities to vaccinate OST recipients against HBV are currently not optimized.</s><s>Reasons might be that awareness is low, because medical doctors offering OST are often not trained in infectious diseases and the dogma that people receiving OST are supposed to stop their injecting drug use.</s><s>The use of stimulant drugs in the past 30 days might be associated with riskier sexual and unsafe use behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tavitian-Exley et al., 2015)</ref>; however, not using a condom during the last sexual intercourse did not seem to be associated with HBV infection status.</s><s>This might indicate that the last intercourse is not a good proxy for life-time sexual risk behaviour or that sexual transmission is not the main route of HBV transmission in this group.</s></p><p><s>PWID aged !25 years or with a higher education level were less likely to have detectable vaccine-induced HBV antibodies.</s><s>An association with high education level was not expected, although scepticism towards vaccination has been observed in persons with higher levels of education in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wei et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, drawing strong conclusions regarding whether different socio-demographic and behavioural factors are the cause or effect of HBV infection and vaccination is not possible.</s></p><p><s>Neither having been incarcerated nor being in OST was significantly associated with showing vaccine-induced HBV antibodies in the MVA, although these could be appropriate settings to target PWID for HBV vaccination.</s><s>Most participants had received their last HBV vaccination from medical doctors not offering addiction therapy, and few had been vaccinated at low-threshold drug services, during rehabilitation/long-term addiction therapy, or in prison, indicating that these settings should be better utilized to improve HBV vaccination rates among PWID in Germany.</s><s>The completion of a vaccination schedule would be easily feasible, e.g. during OST, due to the regular contact with medical staff.</s></p><p><s>The MVA revealed a strong association of the study city particularly with HBV vaccination, and less with infection status, indicating an effect of the local setting.</s><s>In a setting where the proportion of HBV-infected PWID is low (and the proportion of vaccinated PWID high), the transmission of HBV is less likely to occur.</s><s>Furthermore, local differences in practices of medical doctors offering OST, local HBV vaccination, and information campaigns/programmes, e.g. in low-threshold drug services, may also play a role here and need to be examined in further studies to evaluate the differences in the study cities and their impact.</s></p><p><s>Options to increase vaccination coverage among PWID, as recommended by the WHO and EMCDDA, include the immediate availability of on-site vaccination during information and vaccination campaigns targeting PWID, prison-based vaccination programmes, cash incentives, and accelerated immunization schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Campbell et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Sutton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Weaver et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Shah et al., 2015)</ref>; however, these are not routinely implemented in Germany.</s><s>Integrating vaccination campaigns into needle exchange programmes may also be a cost-effective option <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hu et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The self-reported HBV infection and vaccination status had limited validity, with 71% of participants reporting their HBV status and only 45% reporting their HBV vaccination status in concordance with the laboratory tests.</s><s>This discordance between selfreported and tested results has been reported in previous studies among PWID <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Topp et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, among those with a chronic HCV infection, 73% reported their correct HCV status <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Nielsen et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Discordant results also included participants falsely assuming an HBV infection, probably due to confusing HBV with HCV.</s><s>About 20% of study participants assumed that they were vaccinated against HBV, but showed neither vaccine-nor infection-induced antibodies, most probably leaving them at risk of HBV infection.</s><s>Explanations for this might be confusing HBV vaccination with other vaccinations, or insufficient protection due to incomplete vaccination schedules.</s><s>Furthermore, primary (nonresponse) or secondary (waning of antibodies) vaccination failure cannot be excluded as possible explanations for the lack of detection of vaccine-induced HBV antibodies.</s><s>This would lead to an underestimation of the vaccination prevalence, but might also reflect the problem of inadequate immune response to HBV vaccination previously described among PWID <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kamath et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Although all methodologies were validated, a limitation in the direct comparability of test results from the pilot cities and the remaining six cities cannot be excluded due to the change of the laboratory and the methodologies used for testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Zimmermann et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The assessment of all serological test systems for HBV showed good accordance between directly tested serum samples in comparison to DBS, except for anti-HBs in weakly positive sera.</s><s>Weakly anti-HBs-positive samples could have been missed with this procedure.</s><s>Thus the prevalence of anti-HBs antibodies, e.g. of HBV vaccinated individuals, based on the DBS technique must be considered as a conservative estimate, especially in HIV-positive persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ross et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, the anti-HBc results demonstrated high accuracy of the test systems and yielded comparable validation results.</s><s>Furthermore, natural boosting with HBV can be expected among PWID, and choosing a low threshold for the detection of anti-HBs should help minimize the underestimation of HBV vaccination.</s></p><p><s>Although data were anonymized, participants might have been reluctant to report sensitive data such as unsafe use and sexual behaviours correctly, and answers might have been influenced by social desirability bias.</s><s>RDS is an adequate sampling method to reach PWID.</s><s>However, after evaluating the method in this study, it was decided against presenting RDS-weighted results, as some of the necessary assumptions for weighting were not fulfilled in all study cities <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wenz et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Selection bias due to oversampling of persons with communicative competence and who understood the study flow cannot be excluded.</s></p><p><s>This study indicates that despite national vaccination recommendations including both the recommendation of universal infant and child vaccination (since 1995) and risk group vaccination (starting in 1982), many PWID are still at risk of HBV in Germany.</s><s>Targeted information campaigns on HBV and HBV prevention for healthcare and community workers and medical doctors in contact with PWID, as well as for the PWID themselves, need to be intensified.</s><s>PWID should be tested and counselled regularly for HBV, and if tested positive, linked to clinical care to assess the indication for treatment.</s><s>Testing should be followed by a discussion of the results in more detail with the patients, and differences between HBV and HCV should be elucidated.</s><s>Knowledge of the exact status is further important to avoid risk-taking behaviours.</s><s>As the self-reported HBV vaccination status is not reliable, pre-emptive HBV vaccination should be considered if no vaccination record is available.</s><s>Other options with promising results in other countries and recommended by the WHO and EMCDDA include a contingency management approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Weaver et al., 2014)</ref>, a 'don't ask, vaccinate' strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Day et al., 2010)</ref>, and the importance of on-site availability of the vaccination being critical for uptake in a low-threshold setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Campbell et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order to avoid primary vaccination failure, the STIKO recommends control testing of anti-HBs antibody titres at 4-8 weeks after the last vaccination dose, and if titres remain too low (&lt;100 IU/l), further booster vaccinations should be applied (Robert Koch-Institut (RKI), 2014).</s></p><p><s>Many study participants had been incarcerated (city range 73-86%) or were currently or previously in OST (city range 55-89%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wenz et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Ensuring routinely offered HBV vaccination to PWID in these settings would likely improve HBV vaccination rates among PWID in Germany.</s><s>An additional advantage of vaccinating during OST and incarceration is that in these settings, the completion and documentation of a vaccination course are more feasible than in the low-threshold system.</s><s>Nonetheless, vaccination campaigns in low-threshold drug services are important to raise awareness and to reach those people not in contact with medical services, and should also be scaled-up.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
