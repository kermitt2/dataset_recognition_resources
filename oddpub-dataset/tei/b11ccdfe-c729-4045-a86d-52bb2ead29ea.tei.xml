<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Consistent with the third and eighth hypothesis, Stress and TEI accounted both for unique portions of variance in multiple health behaviors over and above mindfulness.</s><s>This contributes to prior research showing that TEI and emotional distress are important factors that are related to how well a person is able to maintain a healthy lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gardner &amp;

Malouff, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, the assumption that mindfulness causally impacts on TEI (and not vice versa) needs further research with longitudinal and experimental data.</s><s>Secondly, content overlap among the scales might limit the validity of the results.</s><s>To preclude artifacts, we created modified scales with nine emotion related items (KIMS) and six well-being related items (TEIQue-SF) removed (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Petrides et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>When the mediation analyses were re-run, all previously significant effects remained significant.</s><s>Thus, controlling for content overlap did not render the results different, which corroborated the validity of the results.</s><s>Thirdly, the web-based design of the survey might impair the quality of the data.</s><s>However, prior evidence suggests that online methods and traditional methods yield basically equivalent data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Davidov &amp; Depner, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Fourthly, only 5.1% of the study participants were male which precluded the ability to examine whether the findings hold across both genders.</s><s>Similar low frequencies of male occupational therapists were also reported elsewhere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gupta et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lloyd et al., 2005)</ref> and may reflect the low base-rate of men in this profession.</s><s>Finally, participants likely differed in their familiarity with the mindfulness concept.</s><s>These differences may lead to differential understanding of mindfulness items, especially of Observe items <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bergomi et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This may bias the 4. Discussion effects of mindfulness.</s><s>More research using experimental or case control designs (compare persons with and without meditation experience) is needed to evaluate this potential bias in the context of the suggested serial two-mediator model.</s><s>Despite these limitations, the present study permitted important insights into the links between mindfulness facets, global TEI, distress, and multiple health behaviors.</s><s>The results have also important clinical implications.</s><s>Given that meditation practice increases mindfulness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Falkenström, 2010)</ref>, TEI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chu, 2010)</ref>, and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Keng et al., 2011)</ref>, the results provide a basis for how to implement mindfulness based interventions aimed at reducing distress and sustaining and increasing health in occupational therapists.</s><s>More generally, since premature mortality and many contemporary health problems are largely preventable by regularly performing multiple health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Loef &amp; Walach, 2012)</ref>, TEI and mindfulness are important individual differences that promote such a healthy lifestyle.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p></p></div></figDesc></figure>
