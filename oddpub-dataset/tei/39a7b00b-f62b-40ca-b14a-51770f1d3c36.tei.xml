<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p><s>The impact of NK cells for solid allograft survival remains elusive.</s><s>As illustrated by accumulating data, NK cells, apart from their role as early effector cells during acute rejection, are also involved in antibody-mediated rejection in the long term.24,25</s><s>Recently, a model of augmentation of host-adaptive alloimmunity by passenger lymphocytes was proposed, illustrating that donor-derived CD4 + T cells can provoke a marked and longlasting augmentation of cellular and humoral alloimmunity resulting in early allograft rejection.4</s><s>This augmentation is prevented by rapid NK cell killing of donor lymphocytes, supporting the role of NK cells as key mediators of tolerance by killing APCs.2,3</s><s>Our present data support this hypothesis, as we could not confirm published observations that a neutralization of NKG2D results in improved allograft survival.17,19</s><s>Consequently, 2 questions arise: first, why do these data contrast sharply with already published data, and, second, why is the deletion of NKG2D, an activating NK cell receptor, important for allograft survival although its functional importance for reactivity has been considerably illustrated in tumor models.</s><s>For instance, mice deficient for NKG2D or treated with an NKG2D-neutralizing antibody are more susceptible to primary tumorigenesis.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Direct comparison of our results with previous reports appears difficult, as we transplanted donor hearts cervically 21,22 and not heterotopically.17,19</s><s>Whereas others applied multiple dosages of CTLA4-Ig resulting in survival times of 30 or 60 days for cardiac grafts,17,19 we administered only 1 single application of CTLA-4 Ig at d2 posttransplantation, which led to a mean survival of 50 days.22</s><s>In our hands, multiple dosages of CTLA-4 Ig alone during the first week posttransplantation resulted in an overall allograft survival of &gt;100 days (data not shown).</s><s>A significant decrease in CD8 + , CD4 + T cells and macrophages was observed under co-stimulation blockade and NKG2D neutralization at day 60.19</s><s>However, we did not detect differences in the same experimental set-up already at day 20 posttransplantation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the same authors conclude that expansion of T REG is one of the main mechanisms contributing to prolonged graft survival following NKG2D blockade, whereas we observed induced T REG frequencies in Klrk1 -/recipients, thus illustrating accelerated graft rejection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Based on the strong alloreactivity in the acute model, we did not detect differences in graft survival (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Although Klrk1 -/--derived NK cells at d5 are impaired in their degranulation capacity, they retain their IFNγ production.</s><s>On the other hand, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells derived from Klrk1 -/mice showed significantly greater degranulation capacity and IFNγ production than did their wildtype counterparts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>This is surprising because NKG2D is thought to mediate co-stimulatory signals in NKG2D + T cells similar to CD28 by augmenting cytotoxic and proliferative responses of T cells, whereas NKG2D signaling directly induces NK cell-mediated cytolysis.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> The significantly stronger IFNγ production and CD107 expression of Klrk1 -/--derived CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is still maintained under co-stimulation blockade (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), suggesting that the lack of NKG2D does not impair the effector function of these cells.</s><s>In line with our findings, recent in vitro data illustrated that neutralization of NKG2D even promotes the differentiation of Th1 cells.</s><s>28 This supports our observations that NKG2D deficiency of NK cells might be compensated by the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, which is sufficient to mediate rejection.</s></p><p><s>Recent research highlights the fact that NK cells are also regulatory cells engaged in reciprocal interaction with dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, and endothelial cells,2-6 thus limiting or exacerbating immune response.</s><s>For instance, NK cells are important for tolerance induction in recipients given donor splenocyte transfusion and anti-CD40L mAb as NK cells may regulate monocyte activation and infiltration into allografts by a mechanism partially dependent on NKG2D receptor-ligand interactions between both cell types.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> We observed significantly greater frequencies of splenic NKG2D ligand-expressing DCs in the acute setting, although these cells were reduced in lymph nodes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Contrarily, in the co-stimulation model, frequencies of DCs and pDCs expressing RAE-1 g were significantly greater in both spleen and lymph nodes of Klrk1 -/recipients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>The potential bidirectional cross-talk between NK cells and DCs plays a relevant role as both cells form a stimulatory synapse, which allows the secretion of IL-12 and IL-15 by DCs.</s><s>These cytokines upregulate the cytolytic function of NK cells and their release of IFNγ and TNFα.30</s><s>Intragraft mRNA expression of IFNγ is the hallmark of both experimental setups as well as the enhanced IFNγ production by Klrk1 -/--derived T cells.</s><s>We can only speculate that NKG2D deficiency leads to a functional impairment of NK cells but is compensated by activated T cells and finally leads to accelerated rejection under co-stimulation blockade.</s><s>Although further studies are necessary, our data clearly emphasize that in models where NK cells are impaired or depleted, transplant tolerance of MHC-mismatched allografts would be difficult to achieve.2-6</s><s>This result overturns the general belief that NK cells should be regarded solely as "killers" and shows that they appear to have an important regulatory role.</s></p></div>
