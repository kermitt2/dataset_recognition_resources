Butlin, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This is the case for chromosomal rearrangements, including inversions, translocations and fusions/fissions.</s><s>Here, we focus on inversions where effective recombination is severely reduced or even completely suppressed in heterozygotes for two arrangements (i.e., heterokaryotypes), particularly near breakpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Coyne, Meyers, Crittenden, &amp; Sniegowski, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Navarro, Betrán, Barbadilla, &amp; Ruiz, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sturtevant 1921;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Sturtevant &amp; Beadle, 1936</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">, Schaeffer et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>It has been claimed that the recombination-suppression effect of inversions can contribute to adaptation and speciation with gene flow in various ways: (a) extending the impact of barrier loci (i.e., loci contributing to reproductive isolation) to linked loci over wider genomic regions and facilitating the accumulation of additional barrier loci within inverted regions despite gene flow between populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Navarro &amp; Barton, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rieseberg, 2001)</ref>, (b) preventing species merging after secondary contact and so paving the way for the accumulation of additional reproductive barriers (e.g., by reinforcement) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Noor, Grams, Bertucci, &amp; Reiland, 2001</ref>) and (c) protecting favourable combinations of locally adapted alleles from being lost, including stochastic loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kirkpatrick &amp; Barton, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rafajlovic, Emanuelsson, Johannesson, Butlin, &amp;

Rieseberg, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>A prediction underlying these different roles is that, in the presence of gene flow, inversions will tend to be enriched for barrier loci.</s></p><p><s>Empirical data from an increasing number of taxa support the role of inversions in adaptation and speciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hoffmann &amp; Rieseberg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hooper &amp; Price, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Wellenreuther &amp; Bernatchez, 2018)</ref>, although for historical reasons much of the evidence concerning the evolutionary genetics of inversions still comes from one genus; Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dobzhansky &amp; Sturtevant, 1938;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Krimbas &amp; Powell, 1992)</ref>.</s><s>However, the power to detect the genomic regions involved in adaptive traits and/or reproductive isolation is generally higher within rearrangements.</s><s>This is because the effects of selection extend to linked sites across large regions of the genome, thus increasing the probability of detection by genome scans <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ravinet et al., 2017)</ref> and potentially biasing evidence in favour of inversions.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, studies showing that adaptation and speciation in some taxa are not influenced by inversions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Davey et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rafati et al., 2018)</ref> may receive less attention than those with positive results.</s><s>In order to achieve an unbiased view of the occurrence and impacts of inversions, approaches are needed that allow for the detection of inversions without relying on pre-existing information either from cytogenetic evidence, which remains limited to taxa where high-resolution chromosome preparations can be obtained, or from genome scans for differentiation.</s></p><p><s>Hybrid zones offer a singular setting for investigating the genomic regions involved in reproductive isolation between natural populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barton &amp; Hewitt, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Harrison, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Harrison &amp; Larson, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Classic hybrid zone theory predicts that alleles at loci under divergent selection or loci involved in incompatibilities introgress less compared with other markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barton &amp; Hewitt, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rieseberg, Whitton, &amp; Gardner, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>This results in clines in allele frequency with the slope at the cline centre, relative to dispersal distance, increasing with the intensity of selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barton &amp;

Barton, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies of hybrid zones between taxa differing by inversions, translocations or fusions, have revealed greater differentiation at neutral markers in genomic regions within or near chromosomal rearrangements, suggesting a barrier to gene flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Giménez et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lee et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rieseberg et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Altogether, this suggests that hybrid zone studies can provide useful information about the presence of chromosomal rearrangements and their role in adaptation and speciation.</s></p><p><s>Although hybrid zones have been extensively studied, the opportunity that they provide to detect rearrangements de novo using genome-wide markers has not been widely exploited (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lee et al., 2017 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Westram et al., 2018 for exceptions)</ref>.</s><s>A wide variety of genotypes is produced by recombination in the central part of a hybrid zone, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) is continuously generated by dispersal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barton &amp; Hewitt, 1985)</ref>.</s><s>Inverted regions with suppressed recombination are expected to alter the balance between these forces, generating blocks of LD that stand out against the genomic background.</s><s>In a sample taken from a transect across a hybrid zone, LD will also be generated by differentiation between parental populations but the loci involved are expected to be spread across the genome, rather than gathered in blocks.</s><s>Therefore, patterns of LD among loci enable the de novo detection of inversions.</s><s>Importantly, the same data can then be used to estimate inversion clines, allowing simultaneous assessment of their role in divergence.</s><s>Candidate rearrangements can be validated by complementary approaches (e.g., linkage maps, genome synteny, BAC-FISH).</s><s>The sequence of events building up associations between adaptive alleles and inversions is not yet well known for most case studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jackson, Butlin, Navarro, &amp; Faria, 2016)</ref> and hybrid zone studies may help here as well.</s></p><p><s>The rocky intertidal encompasses steep gradients of several factors (e.g., wave exposure, temperature, salinity, humidity, predation, competition and facilitation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Raffaelli &amp; Hawkins, 1996)</ref>, providing a fertile ground to improve our understanding of adaptation and the origins of reproductive isolation.</s><s>The presence of locally adapted distinct ecotypes in the intertidal has been investigated in several gastropod species (Nucella lapillus, Littorina saxatilis and L. fabalis;

(2018)</ref> to suggest a component of balancing selection, rather than purely divergent selection.</s><s>Interestingly, balancing selection has frequently been documented for inversion polymorphisms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Butlin &amp; Day, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dobzhansky, 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr">reviewed by Wellenreuther &amp; Bernatchez, 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Using cytogenetic techniques, the karyotype of L. saxatilis has been established, with a haploid number of 17 chromosomes that appears to be conserved among ecotypes and closely related species <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Birstein &amp; Mikhailova, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Janson, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rolán-Alvarez, Buño, &amp; Gosalvez, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>However, the poor resolution of these techniques did not allow for identification of chromosomal rearrangements.</s><s>Here, we combine genomic resources and genetic data from laboratory crosses for L. saxatilis with LD information from a hybrid zone.</s><s>We test the proposal that the genomic blocks of outlier SNPs detected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Westram et al.
