<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dietary assessment</head><p><s>Details of the dietary assessment have previously been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In brief, a semi-quantitative Ghana-Specific Food Propensity Questionnaire (Ghana-FPQ) was developed to assess the usual dietary intake of 134 food items.</s><s>The Ghana-FPQ queries for the intake frequencies of food groups at pre-defined portion sizes in the preceding 12 months.</s><s>In a random sub-sample (n = 251), we also conducted 24-hour dietary recalls (24HDRs) in face-to-face interviews to collect information about recipes, foods that are representative for specific food groups, and site-specific portion sizes.</s><s>For the translation of food consumption (g/day) into energy (kcal/day) and nutrients intakes (g/day, mg/day, µg/day), Ghana-FPQ data were linked with the latest versions of the West African Food Composition Table <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and the German Nutrient Database (BLS 3.01, 2010) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food variety, dietary diversity, and dietary patterns</head><p><s>In the present study, between-food group variety refers to the number of different food groups that are consumed on a weekly basis.</s><s>The Food Variety Score (FVS) reflected this concept and was defined as the sum of all foods in pre-defined food groups that are usually consumed per week <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>For the construction of this count measure, food items of the Ghana-FPQ were collapsed into 20 food groups according to the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) food group classification guidance, which consider the similarities in nutrient profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The maximum achievable score points for the FVS was 20, and scoring criteria are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition, within-food group variety describes the daily diversification of broader food categories.</s><s>The corresponding Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was calculated as the sum of seven food categories, of which the composing food groups were consumed at least once per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, i.e., staples, dairy, meat and alternatives (protein), fruits, vegetables, fats and oils, and beverages.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the food groups of the FVS that contributed to DDS food categories</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of covariates</head><p><s>All participants underwent an anthropometric examination in light clothing and without shoes, including weight (kg), height (cm), and waist circumference (cm).</s><s>Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/(height) 2 (kg/m 2 ).</s><s>Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were recorded.</s><s>These comprised age (years), sex (male and female), and educational status (never been to school or elementary school, lower vocational schooling or lower secondary schooling, intermediate vocational schooling or intermediate/higher secondary schooling, and higher vocational schooling or university).</s><s>Physical activity was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor Surveillance (STEPS) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and was categorized as high, moderate, or low.</s><s>Smoking status was recorded as current, former or non-smokers.</s><s>The relationships of the FVS, the DDS, and the DQI-I variety component with exploratory DPs were examined.</s><s>Partial Spearman correlations were calculated for the constructed scores (FVS, DDS, and DQI-I) and the previously identified patterns, adjusted for age (years), sex (m/f), study site (5 sites), education (4 categories), energy intake (kcal/day), smoking status (current or former/nonsmoker), physical activity (MET-h/week), BMI (kg/m 2 ), and waist circumference (cm).</s></p><p><s>Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values for T2D were calculated per 1 score point and per 1 SD of the constructed variety scores using logistic regression.</s><s>Three models were constructed: model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and study site; model 2: model 1 + education, energy intake, smoking status, and physical activity; and model 3 accounted for an effect of diet on T2D independent of body composition: model 2 + BMI and waist circumference.</s><s>Participants who knew that they had T2D might have changed their diet because of the diagnosis.</s><s>To limit this potential of reverse causation, we calculated the associations with T2D among individuals with screen-detected T2D, i.e., excluding self-reported T2D (n = 3733).</s><s>Moreover, replication analyses were performed in an independent study population from urban Ghana (n = 1221) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The associations of the FVS, the DDS, and the DQI-I variety component with T2D were compared with those seen in the urban Ghanaian RODAM study site (n = 1364) (Online Resource 2).</s></p><p><s>The associations of DPs with T2D were calculated for each quintile of the pattern scores, using the first quintile as the reference category.</s><s>Also, for linear associations, we calculated ORs and corresponding 95% CIs for T2D per 1 SD increase of the pattern scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the FVS, the DDS, and the DQI-I variety component were included in the multiple-adjusted regression models, relating DPs with T2D, to examine a change in estimate.</s></p></div>
