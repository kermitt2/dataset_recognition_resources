and 2) disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR), or also named "closed-lock", in which the displacement of the disc is not reduced during mouth opening.</s><s>The mandible deviates to the affected side and the mandibular range of motion is limited.</s><s>Pain occurs in most patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Panoramic and transcranial radiographs show only bone changes of TMJ (asymmetries, tumors, fractures, degenerative disease in late stages), but they are limited due to the overlap of the zygomatic arch and base of the skull.</s><s>Cone beam CT is useful in the detection of morphological TMJ changes, but is not able to visualize the soft tissue structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>MRI is considered to be the reference standard in visualizing the disc-condyle relationship and the soft tissue structures of TMJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>.</s><s>The accuracy of the MRI in revealing the disc position is 95% compared to autopsy studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Its disadvantages are the high cost, low availability, and restricted use in patients with claustrophobia, pacemakers, and in patients with ferromagnetic metal implants <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>US was first used for TMJ exploration in 1991, by Nabeih et al, using a 3.5 MHz transducer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</s><s>It is a non-invasive, dynamic, inexpensive imaging technique which can be useful in diagnosing articular disc displacements.</s><s>Variable levels of sensitivity were reported in detection of disc displacement, therefore further studies are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>.</s><s>It is a technique that depends widely on the operator.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of US in the detection of TMJ disc displacements, compared to MRI.</s><s>An important goal of this research was to determine whether US could be a routine imaging technique in assessing the presence or absence of TMJ disc displacement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical examination</head><p><s>The diagnosis of TMD was based on the patient's history and physical examination.</s><s>The clinical evaluation was performed by an oral surgeon and included a comprehensive examination of TMJ, masticatory, and cervical muscles.</s><s>Occlusion analyze, both static and dynamic was performed.</s><s>Signs and symptoms associated with articular TMD could be represented by pain, presence of articular sounds, abnormal mandibular movement, jaw locking, and ear discomfort.</s><s>The diagnostic decision tree was done according to RDC/TMD.</s></p><p><s>Ultrasonography US examination was performed on a Hitachi EUB 8500 (Hitachi Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan) machine with L 54 M 6.5-13 MHz linear transducer.</s><s>The images were obtained using the 13 MHz frequency, by the same examiner, experienced in head and neck ultrasound for 9 years.</s><s>The examiner was blinded to clinical findings and    MRI results.</s><s>All the examinations were conducted in a dark room, with the patient in a supine position.</s></p><p><s>The probe was placed in the anatomical position of the TMJ, perpendicular to the zygomatic arch and parallel to the mandible ramus.</s><s>Both transverse and longitudinal scans were performed.</s><s>Once the transducer was placed in the right position and the TMJ was visualized, the probe was tilted out until the best view was obtained.</s><s>Bilateral images were stored, both with the mouth closed and maximal mouth opening positions.</s><s>During the examination also the dynamic movement of the disc was assessed.</s></p><p><s>At US examination, the non-displaced disc normally appears as a thin hyperechoic line surrounded by a hypoechoic halo (fig 1 a,b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In the closed-mouth position, the disc is placed between two hyperechoic lines, represented by the condylar surface and articular eminence (between the anterosuperior zone of the mandibular condyle and posterosuperior part of the articular eminence).</s><s>If the disc is located anteriorly to the anatomical position, the aspect is interpreted as anterior disc displacement (fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Opened-mouth US examination reveals the normal position of the disc between the mandibular condyle and the articular eminence.</s><s>Again, the anterior position of the disc is diagnosed as anterior disc displacement (fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>If the disc is anteriorly displaced when the mouth is closed and returns in the anatomical position when the mouth opens, the diagnosis is DDwR (fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>If the disc remains displaced at opened-mouth position, the US diagnosis is DDwoR (fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions</head><p><s>For an accurate diagnosis of internal TMJ disorders, the clinical examination is crucial, but not enough, therefore additional investigations are required.</s><s>MRI is considered to be the reference standard in visualizing the soft tissue of TMJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>US has been suggested by several studies as a useful diagnostic tool but the diagnostic value reported had contradictory results.</s></p><p><s>Not all clinically assessed disc displacements were confirmed by MRI.</s><s>Articular joint sounds could be common among adult population and could represent a transient condition of TMJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We found a significant sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of high-resolution US in the diagnosis of disc displacements, but low sensitivity for degenerative changes, compared to MRI.</s><s>US allowed a good visualization of the disc with mouth closed, but also during maximal mandibular range of motion.</s><s>In some cases, where the overlying structures were very thick, the visualization of the disc was difficult, but by asking the patient to open and close the mouth several times, the disc could be visualized.</s><s>Since the obtained specificity was slightly lower than sensitivity, further studies are recommended to reduce the proportion of false-positive interpretations.</s></p><p><s>A difficulty in our study, seen also in other papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, was to obtain high US quality images of TMJ, especially at mouth-opened position, due to the overlying bony structures.</s><s>It was necessary to adjust continuously the transducer orientation in order to assess the correct disc position.</s></p><p><s>In 4 cases with disc displacements not diagnosed by US, the discs were medially displaced and in these conditions, the condyle did not allow the visualization of the disc.</s><s>In other 5 cases, the disc displacements were minor and were not recognized by US.</s><s>Our belief is that continuously training for interpretation of the US findings could lead to the diagnosis even of these minor disc displacements.</s></p><p><s>A review published in 2009 by Manfredini D et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> showed an accuracy of 54-100% for diagnosing disc displacement and 56-93% for degenerative changes and the authors concluded that US is a useful imaging technique, but a better standardization is required and normal parameters must be set.</s><s>Another review published in 2013 by Kundu H et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> found a sensitivity ranging from 41% to 90% in the diagnosis of disc displacement.</s></p><p><s>The heterogeneous results of the reviews may be due to the fact that they depend on the skills of the examiner, on the equipment used (different US frequencies), and the difficulty of visualizing the articular disc because of the surrounded anatomical structures.</s><s>In our study, the examiner has been experienced in head and neck ultrasound for 9 years and quality US equipment was used.</s></p><p><s>Jank et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> showed also a high sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 84% and accuracy of 88% for disc displacements, with patient at rest and suggested that US is suited to detect disc displacements.</s><s>Habashi et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> found the estimated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosis of disc displacement based on high-resolution ultrasonography to be 74.3%, 84.2% and 77.7%, respectively.</s><s>It was concluded that ultrasonography is a potential imaging technique for the diagnosis of TMJ disc displacement.</s><s>Another study developed by Emshoff et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref> evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of US in TMD.</s><s>In detecting the disc position, US had a sensitivity of 31% and a specificity of 95%.</s></p><p><s>Compared to these studies, we found better statistical parameters, probably due to the higher number of patients and the use of a better US equipment.</s><s>Using high-resolution US (13 MHz in our study), the diagnostic efficacy of US in the diagnosis of TMJ disc displacement can be significantly increased.</s></p><p><s>In a previous prospective study, US yielded a sensitivity, specificity and an accuracy of 92% each, in the detection of disc displacements at closed-mouth position <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The same study design and inclusion criteria were used.</s><s>Our results showed similar statistical values.</s></p><p><s>Landes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> found a concordance of 83 % between US and MRI in the diagnosis of TMJ disc displacements.</s><s>In their work, the US examination was performed with the patient in vertical position, which is different from the MRI position.</s><s>This could influence assessing the correct position of the TMJ disc.</s><s>In our study, both US and MRI were performed with the patient in a supine position.</s></p><p><s>One article published by Emshoff et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref> calculated the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement of US in TMJ pathology.</s><s>Intra-observer agreement ranged between 87-93% and inter-observer agreement ranged between 82-90%.</s><s>Some authors suggested the use of indirect signs for disc displacements, such as lateral capsule-condyle distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>These measurements can only be used if the PPV -positive predictive value, NPV -negative predictive value, CI -confidence interval disc is displaced in an antero-lateral direction.</s><s>According to different studies, antero-lateral disc displacement is less frequent than antero-medial disc displacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We have not compared our results with the studies that have used only static high-resolution US.</s></p><p><s>This study presents some limitations.</s><s>One important limitation is that each imaging examination was performed by a single radiologist.</s><s>No intra-observer and inter-observer agreement was done.</s><s>Another limitation is that the accuracy of MRI (reference standard) is not 100%, therefore the statistical values obtained might be slightly different from the reality.</s><s>Also, the results of both US and MRI are influenced by the examiner's experience.</s></p><p><s>In our opinion, the clinical examination is the most important step in the diagnosis of TMJ pathology.</s><s>There is still no evidence when and which imaging technique should be indicated for TMD patients.</s><s>We recommend the use of US when a disc displacement is clinically presumed because of its high diagnostic accuracy, low cost and accessibility.</s><s>The new US techniques increase the capacity to detect the TMJ disc displacement.</s></p><p><s>US did not reach the diagnostic value of MRI, but it could be an acceptable alternative imaging technique in assessing the TMJ disc position and treatment follow up.</s><s>The protocol we recommend, based on our results, is to first perform the
