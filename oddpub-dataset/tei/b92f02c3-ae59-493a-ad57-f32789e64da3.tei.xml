<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Toll-like receptors (TLR) constitute a highly conserved class of receptors through which the innate immune system responds to both pathogen-and host-derived factors.</s><s>Although TLRs are involved in a wide range of central nervous system (CNS) disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular events leading from CNS injury to activation of these innate immune receptors remain elusive.</s><s>The stress protein heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) released from injured cells is considered an endogenous danger signal of the immune system.</s><s>In this context, the main objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of extracellular HSP60 on the brain in vivo.</s><s>Results: We show here that HSP60 injected intrathecally causes neuronal and oligodendrocyte injury in the CNS in vivo through TLR4-dependent signaling.</s><s>Intrathecal HSP60 results in neuronal cell death, axonal injury, loss of oligodendrocytes, and demyelination in the cerebral cortex of wild-type mice.</s><s>In contrast both mice lacking TLR4 and the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 are protected against deleterious effects induced by HSP60.</s><s>In contrast to the exogenous TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide, intrathecal HSP60 does not induce such a considerable inflammatory response in the brain.</s><s>In the CNS, endogenous HSP60 is predominantly expressed in neurons and released during brain injury, since the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from animals of a mouse stroke model contains elevated levels of this stress protein compared to the CSF of sham-operated mice.</s><s>Conclusions: Our data show a direct toxic effect of HSP60 towards neurons and oligodendrocytes in the CNS.</s><s>The fact that these harmful effects involve TLR4 and MyD88 confirms a molecular pathway mediated by the release of endogenous TLR ligands from injured CNS cells common to many forms of brain diseases that bi-directionally links CNS injury and activation of the innate immune system to neurodegeneration and demyelination in vivo.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Inflammation, neuronal injury, and demyelination are common hallmarks of most central nervous system (CNS) diseases.</s><s>Innate immunity activated through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) contributes to various forms of CNS injury.</s><s>TLRs are a highly conserved class of type 1 transmembrane receptors that are involved in regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Thirteen members of the TLR family (TLR1-13) have been identified so far in humans, eleven of which are expressed in mice.</s><s>Whereas some members of the TLR family including TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 locate to intracellular compartments, other TLRs such as TLR4 are membrane-bound.</s><s>TLRs detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns expressed by various infectious agents including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.</s><s>However, TLRs are not only activated by pathogen-associated molecules, but also by host-derived factors that are supposedly released during tissue injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>For example, TLR4 is activated by both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria and host-derived molecules such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) including HSP60 and HSP70, extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin extra domain A and soluble heparin sulphate, and other proteins including β-defensin and high mobility group box 1 protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Upon binding to their respective ligands, TLRs initiate signaling through their intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domains.</s><s>These interact with other TIR domains such that, upon activation, each TLR binds to a specific set of adaptor proteins that also contain TIR domains.</s><s>Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is the universal intracellular adaptor recruited by all known TLRs except TLR3.</s><s>In general, triggering of the well-described complex TLR-associated signaling pathway results in activation of various downstream effectors including NF-κB, in turn leading to an inflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or, occasionally, to cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>TLRs are widely expressed in innate immune cells such as macrophages and microglia in the CNS and dendritic cells, but also in non-immune cells such as neurons and epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Injured tissues release factors including HSPs, which represent a collection of evolutionarily conserved proteins induced in response to cellular stress such as heat shock, nutrient deprivation, or mechanical damage, and which are considered endogenous danger signals to the immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to serving as a cellular chaperone, extracellular HSP60 directly activates immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells through binding to TLRs and several other membrane receptors such as CD14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this finding, we observed in previous work that HSP60 provides a signal to microglia, the major immune cell of the brain, alerting to the presence of CNS injury through activation of a TLR4-dependent pathway in cultured CNS cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this study we systematically analyze the impact of extracellular HSP60 on the brain.</s><s>Intrathecal HSP60 results in CNS injury including neurodegeneration and demyelination.</s><s>These effects require both TLR4 and MyD88.</s><s>In contrast to intrathecal application of HSP60, intrathecal injection of the established pathogen-derived TLR4 ligand LPS does not affect neuronal or oligodendrocyte survival in vivo.</s><s>However, whereas intrathecal LPS leads to robust production of proinflammatory molecules in the brain, CNS injury induced by HSP60 is not accompanied by such an inflammatory response.</s><s>HSP60 is predominantly expressed in injured neurons and oligodendrocytes and is released during CNS injury such as focal cerebral ischemia in vivo.</s><s>Based on our findings we speculate that activation of the TLR signaling pathway triggered by endogenous ligands may serve as a damage-specific danger signal in the CNS.</s></p></div>
