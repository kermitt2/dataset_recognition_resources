<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Even after potentially curative R0 resection, patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a poor prognosis owing to high rates of local recurrence and metastasis to distant organs.</s><s>However, we have no suitable transgenic animal models for surgical interventions.</s><s>METHODS: To induce formation of pancreatic tumor foci, we electroporated oncogenic plasmids into pancreata of LSL-KrasG12D Â p53fl/fl mice; mutant Kras was expressed in p53fl/fl mice using a sleeping beauty transposon.</s><s>We co-delivered a transposon encoding a constitutively active form of Akt2 (myrAkt2).</s><s>Carcinogenesis and histopathologic features of tumors were examined.</s><s>Metastasis was monitored by bioluminescence imaging.</s><s>Tumors were resected and mice were given gemcitabine, and tumor recurrence patterns and survival were determined.</s><s>Immune cells were collected from resection sites and analyzed by flow cytometry and in depletion experiments.</s><s>RESULTS: After electroporation of oncogenic plasmids, mice developed a single pancreatic tumor nodule with histopathologic features of human PDAC.</s><s>Pancreatic tumors that expressed myrAkt2 infiltrated the surrounding pancreatic tissue and neurons and became widely metastatic, reflecting the aggressive clinical features of PDAC in patients.</s><s>Despite early tumor resection, mice died from locally recurring and distant tumors, but adjuvant administration of gemcitabine after tumor resection prolonged survival.</s><s>In mice given adjuvant gemcitabine or vehicle, gemcitabine significantly inhibited local recurrence of tumors, but not metastasis to distant organs, similar to observations in clinical trials.</s><s>Gemcitabine inhibited accumulation of CD11bþGr1intF4/80int myeloid-derived suppressor cells at the resection margin and increased the number of natural killer (NK) cells at this location.</s><s>NK cells but not T cells were required for gemcitabine-mediated antitumor responses.</s><s>CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine administration after resection of pancreatic tumors in mice activates NK cell-mediated antitumor responses and inhibits local recurrence of tumors, consistent with observations from patients with PDAC.</s><s>Transgenic mice with resectable pancreatic tumors might be promising tools to study adjuvant therapy strategies for patients.</s><s>2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Aggressive local tissue infiltrations including neural invasions and early metastasis are typical clinical features of PDAC.</s><s>Surgical resection is the only curative option for nondisseminated PDAC.</s><s>However, even after early complete resection the prognosis remains poor owing to recurrence rates of 80%-85%.</s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Despite advances in adjuvant chemotherapy, most PDAC patients die within 2 years after surgery.</s><s>In a large phase III study (CONKO-001), adjuvant gemcitabine achieved a 20.7% 5-year overall survival rate compared with 10.4% in the observation group and a prolonged median survival of 22.1 vs 20.2 months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>The development of new therapeutic strategies is needed urgently, but rapid advancements appear unlikely owing to long follow-up periods in clinical studies.</s><s>The choice for adjuvant therapies frequently depends on preclinical and clinical experiences from corresponding palliative studies.</s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> However, multifocal tumor growth and the presence of genetic alterations in the entire organ do not allow surgical R0 resection in these models.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we established novel R0 resectable transgenic mice models of PDAC.</s><s>For this purpose, we developed an in situ electroporation technique that facilitates rapid and cost-saving generation of genetically highly flexible transgenic mouse models with a localized singular tumor for surgical resection.</s><s>Despite very early R0 resection of small PDACs, nearly all animals died rapidly because of local or distant tumor recurrence in resectable transgenic mice, reflecting the malignant features and the course of the human disease.</s><s>Moreover, the significant improvement of the outcome by postoperative systemic gemcitabine in resectable transgenic mice could recapitulate the phase III adjuvant CONKO-001 data reliably, indicating the predictive value of the new models.</s><s>Furthermore, we show that adjuvant gemcitabine treatment selectively depletes a Gr1 int F4/80 int subpopulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) at the resection margin and significantly enhanced local natural killer (NK) cell infiltration.</s><s>Finally, our experiments show that the survival benefit of adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine is the result of NK cell-dependent inhibition of local recurrence whereas systemic NK cells as well as distant metastases are less affected by the adjuvant treatment.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electroporation Technique</head><p><s>Six-to 8-week-old p53 fl/fl mice (strain B6.129P2-Trp53 tm1Brn /J) or LSL-KrasG12D Â p53fl/fl mice (B6.129S-Kras tm4Tyj Â B6.129P2-Trp53 tm1Brn /J) were anesthetized and the pancreatic tail was prepared for plasmid injection.</s><s>By using a CUY21SC Electroporator (NepaGene, Ichikawa, Japan), electric pulses for plasmid transfer into pancreatic tissue were generated with a 5-mm diameter tweezer-type electrode.</s><s>Plasmid DNA (50 mL of 0.5 mg/mL) was injected into the pancreas using a 27-gauge needle and the bleb was placed between the electrode disks.</s><s>Four electric pulses were administered twice with a 35-ms duration at 35 V and an interval of 500 ms.</s><s>The peritoneal cavity was washed 3 times with 2.5 mL distilled water at 40 C and closed by suturing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resection Technique</head><p><s>Mice were laparotomized, and tumor-bearing pancreatic tail and spleen were prepared.</s><s>Without touching the tumor, the blood vessel of the spleen was disconnected using a ligating clip (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany), coagulated at 12 W with a 0.4-mm bipolar forceps (Erbe GmbH, Tübingen, Germany), and cut off with a scissor.</s><s>Pancreatic tissue adjacent to the stomach also was disconnected by clamping, coagulation, and cutting.</s><s>Thus, the pancreatic tail including the primary tumor can be removed proximal to the pancreatic head by disconnecting the pancreatic body including blood vessels by using one clip followed by coagulation and cutting.</s><s>The resection margin and remaining tissue were controlled to confirm complete tumor resection.</s><s>The peritoneal cavity was washed and closed by suturing as described earlier.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Situ Electroporation Technique Induces the Formation of a Singular Primary PDAC</head><p><s>We established an in situ electroporation technique (EP) for locally restricted transfection of the pancreatic parenchyma using 2 different DNA plasmid set-ups.</s><s>We used the most frequent genetic alterations of human PDAC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> which facilitate histologic features of human PDAC in transgenic models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>In a first model, a Cre-recombinase plasmid was used for in situ pancreas transfection in LSL-Kras-G12D Â p53fl/fl mice (KPfl model) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), leading to focal p53 deletion and Kras-G12V expression.</s><s>Alternatively, co-delivery of SB13-transposase with a Kras-G12V-expressing transposon in p53fl/fl mice (Pfl model) achieved somatic integration of Kras-G12V into the genome, whereas Cre-recombinase induced deletion of p53.</s><s>Singular tumor formation at the site of transfection within the pancreatic tail was reliably observed using both approaches (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Because formation of singletumor nodules at the site of electroporation enables surgical resection of primary tumors, these models are referred to as resectable transgenic mice.</s><s>Kras-G12V integration or p53 deletion alone did not induce tumor growth (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>Overexpression of mutant-Kras (Pfl model) shortened survival and led to accelerated and isochronal tumor formation compared with the KPfl model (29-37 vs 63-105 days) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>Although primary tumors of the KPfl model histologically reflect moderately differentiated human PDAC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>), the Pfl model led to poorly differentiated PDAC.</s><s>Considering the upstream activation of Kras signaling, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-1/2 was detected in both models.</s><s>Tumors also expressed cytokeratin 19, a marker of PDAC, and were surrounded by dense desmoplastic stroma positive for a-smooth muscle actin.</s><s>Together, the staining in both models showed typical histopathologic features of human PDAC.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PDAC Development Involves Acinar-to-Ductal Metaplasia and Pancreatitis</head><p><s>We investigated the early phase after electroporation and subsequent carcinogenesis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2A</ref>).</s><s>The Pfl model was used owing to the fast and isochronous tumor formation.</s><s>After 3 days, immune cell infiltration was observed at the site of electroporation.</s><s>Syncytial cells could be detected as well as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM).</s><s>After 7 days, mitotic acinar cells were detectable, suggesting ongoing transformation.</s><s>Indicating pancreatitis, strong immune cell infiltration and ADM were evident all the time.</s><s>Later, extended areas of transformed acini (day 14) and mature adenocarcinoma (day 21) became visible.</s><s>At these later time points, all stages of PanIN lesions were detectable (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2B</ref>).</s><s>The origin of tumorigenesis was investigated by tracking with a codelivered enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transposon (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2C</ref>).</s><s>Observable EGFP-positive cells co-expressed amylase, an acinar cell-specific marker, whereas EGFP-positive ductal or islet cells were not detected (data not shown).</s><s>Electron microscopy (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) showed altered acinar cells 3 days after EP.</s><s>Preserved tight junctions with normal acinar cells indicate that these cells were part of the acinar epithelium.</s><s>After 6 days, nearly all cells of 1 acinus showed alterations.</s><s>Together, our findings suggest acinar cells as preferred targets of EP, initiating a rapid ADM-to-PanIN and PDAC progression.</s></p></div>

electroporation-mediated plasmid transfection technique for local pancreas transformation.</s><s>Recently, the enormous potential of intrapancreatic plasmid electroporation also was confirmed by a report describing electroporationmediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 for multiple gene editing and for studying functional genomics in murine PDAC models. <ref type="bibr"

target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>djuvant treatment with gemcitabine significantly improved survival in all groups of resectable transgenic mice, mainly attributable to a significant reduction of local recurrences.</s><s>Importantly, the recurrence pattern and overall results in resectable transgenic mice reflect the corresponding clinical phase III CONKO-001 trial.</s><s>In agreement with our
