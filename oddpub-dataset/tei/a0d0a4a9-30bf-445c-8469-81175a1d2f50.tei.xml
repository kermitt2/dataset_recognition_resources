<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Older adults frequently experience a decrease in balance control that leads to increased numbers of falls, injuries and hospitalization.</s><s>Therefore, evaluating older adults' ability to maintain balance and examining new approaches to counteract age-related decline in balance control is of great importance for fall prevention and healthy aging.</s><s>Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been shown to beneficially influence motor behavior and motor learning.</s><s>In the present study, we investigated the influence of tDCS applied over the leg area of the primary motor cortex (M1) on balance task learning of healthy elderly in a dynamic balance task (DBT).</s><s>In total, 30 older adults were enrolled in a cross-sectional, randomized design including two consecutive DBT training sessions.</s><s>Only during the first DBT session, either 20 min of anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) or sham tDCS (s-tDCS) were applied and learning improvement was compared between the two groups.</s><s>Our data showed that both groups successfully learned to perform the DBT on both training sessions.</s><s>Interestingly, between-group analyses revealed no difference between the a-tDCS and the s-tDCS group regarding their level of task learning.</s><s>These results indicate that the concurrent application of tDCS over M1 leg area did not elicit DBT learning enhancement in our study cohort.</s><s>However, a regression analysis revealed that DBT performance can be predicted by the kinematic profile of the movement, a finding that may provide new insights for individualized approaches of treating balance and gait disorders.</s></p></div>

<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kaminski et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Our results showed that tDCS over M1 leg area is capable of enhancing balance performance in the DBT as participants showed higher task performance and lower error rates during and after tDCS compared to a control group.</s><s>To follow up on these findings, in the present study we wanted to examine the feasibility of using the DBT as a balance learning task in elderly participants.</s><s>Our main objective was to evaluate the effect of a-tDCS on DBT learning in older adults.</s><s>Additionally, we analyzed the kinematic profile of DBT learning performance in our aged cohort as kinematic variables have been shown to be sensitive markers of postural stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Yu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bisson et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In specific, we aimed to identify whether kinematic variables velocity, acceleration, jerk and postural sway frequency can predict balance performance in healthy elderly.</s><s>In our previous study, we found that kinematic variables can well predict DBT performance in younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kaminski et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, our results showed that performance improvements were mediated by tDCS-induced changes in movement velocity.</s><s>According to this previous study, we hypothesized that (A) a-tDCS over M1 leg area during DBT learning facilitates learning performance compared with a group receiving s-tDCS in an older age cohort.</s><s>Additionally, we expected that (B) the kinematic profile assessed during DBT learning predicts the DBT performance level of elderly with a special impact of velocity on performance improvement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Thirty healthy elderly participants (17 females, mean age = 67.7 ± 6 years) were enrolled in this study.</s><s>All participants gave written informed consent and the study procedures were approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Leipzig and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and only healthy participants were included.</s><s>To exclude the presence of any neurological disease and/or contraindications, all participants underwent a detailed neurological examination prior to the testing phase.</s><s>All participants were free of any medication affecting the CNS and were task naïve.</s><s>All participants were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (mean score 90.03; range 55-100; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Oldfield, 1971)</ref> and did not show any signs of cognitive impairment, measured by the Mini Mental State Examination <ref type="bibr">(MMSE, mean score: 29.23, range: 27-30;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Folstein et al., 1975)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we assessed participants standing balance ability before the experimental procedure using the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rose et al., 2006)</ref>, a multidimensional balance scale specifically designed to evaluate balance ability of functionally independent older adults.</s><s>We also assessed participants' level of physical activity with the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Craig et al., 2003)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>The study was comprised of two consecutive training sessions that were separated by 24 h.</s><s>On the first training day (TD1), participants performed 15 trials of DBT training while 20 min of tDCS were applied over the leg motor cortex (M1 leg area).</s><s>Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition, where they received 20 min of a-tDCS, or the sham-control condition, where s-tDCS was applied.</s><s>On the second training day (TD2), another 15 trials of DBT training were performed without tDCS.</s><s>This was done to examine the effects of a-tDCS on consolidation of the newly acquired motor skill and to capture longer lasting a-tDCS effects on a consecutive training session.</s><s>During each session, the platform position of each subject in each trial was continuously recorded using the Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, UK) software.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole-Body Dynamic Balancing Task (DBT)</head><p><s>The DBT was performed on a stability platform (model 16030, LaFayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN, USA) with a maximal deviation of 26 • to each side.</s><s>A detailed description of the procedure is provided elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Taubert et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kaminski et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In brief, subjects were instructed to stand on the movable platform and to keep it in a horizontal position as long as possible during a trial length of 30 s.</s><s>On each training day, 15 trials were performed with between-trial rest intervals of 90 s to avoid muscle fatigue.</s><s>Hence, each training session lasted approximately 29 min, including breaks.</s><s>To prevent falls, participants were secured with a safety harness during training.</s><s>The primary performance measure was the total time participants were able to keep the platform in a horizontal position within a range of ±3 • to each side, henceforth referred as Time in Balance (TiB).</s><s>After each trial, participants were provided with their TiB value as verbal feedback but besides that, no strategy on how to best perform the task was provided (discovery learning approach; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wulf et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Orrell et al., 2006)</ref>.</s></p></div>
