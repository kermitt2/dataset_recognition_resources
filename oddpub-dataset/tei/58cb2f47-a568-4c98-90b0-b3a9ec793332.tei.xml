<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical statement</head><p><s>All animal experiments were approved by the President of Kitasato University and National Center for Global Health and Medicine, following consideration by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kitasato University (approval ID: no.</s><s>17-099) and National Center for Global Health and Medicine (approval ID: no.</s><s>17056), and were carried out in accordance with institutional procedures, national guidelines and the relevant national laws on the protection of animals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Breeding of congenic mice</head><p><s>The ICR-derived glomerulonephritis (ICGN) mouse provides a model of glomerular dysfunction that shows gross morphological changes in the podocyte foot processes that accompany proteinuria (Appendix S1).</s><s>Previously, we showed that proteinuria in ICGN mice was caused by a deletion mutation in the ten-sin2 (Tns2) gene (designated Tns2 nph ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>As the original ICGN mouse is a spontaneous mutant derived from closed colony ICR mice, there is no control strain.</s><s>We therefore created a control strain by using classical breeding methods to introgress the wild-type Tns2 gene (Tns2 WT ) from the C57BL/6J (B6) mouse into the inbred ICGN strain (ICGN.B6-Tns2 WT ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>We moved the Tns2 WT allele onto the ICGN genetic background by backcrossing for 10 generations, and subsequently homozygous ICGN.B6-Tns2 WT /Tns2 WT mice were produced by sib mating.</s><s>During this strain breeding process, we discovered mutant mice with polydipsia, polyuria, hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia, which we named ihs mice (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>As ihs mice are spontaneous mutants derived from ICGN mice, which are an animal model for congenital nephrosis, B6 mice were used in the present study as a reference.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotype measurements</head><p><s>The mice were weighed weekly from 5 weeks-of-age.</s><s>The nasal-anal length was measured, and the body mass index was calculated at 12, 25 and 52 weeks by taking the weight (g) and dividing it by the square of the nasal-anal length (cm).</s><s>Body composition was measured by NMR (LF50 BCA-Analyzer; Bruker, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incidence of diabetes, and survival</head><p><s>The cumulative incidence of diabetes in ihs mice, determined by the casual blood glucose level, is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>.</s><s>Diabetes was observed only in male mice.</s><s>The earliest onset was observed at 9-12 weeks, and its incidence increased with age (33 and 89% at 12 and 42 weeks, respectively).</s><s>Glucosuria appeared in male mice at 9-12 weeks, concomitant with the onset of diabetes, and was present in 88.9% of mice aged 42 weeks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Because the onset of diabetes differed between the sexes, we focused our studies on male mice.</s><s>At 45 weeks-of-age, the survival rate of the male ihs mice was approximately 50%, decreasing to approximately 42% at 51 weeks, compared with 81% survival at 51 weeks in female ihs mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>This indicated that the onset of diabetes influenced the survival of male ihs mice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical features of the ihs mice</head><p><s>Aged 11 weeks, the ihs mice (32.4 -0.4 g, n = 10) were significantly lighter than the ICR mice (33.8 -1.9 g, P &lt; 0.01, n = 9).</s><s>However, at 12 weeks, the ihs mice were heavier than the B6 strain mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>The bodyweight of the B6 mice continued to increase until 52 weeks-of-age, whereas growth in the ihs mice reached a plateau (35 g) at 25 weeks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), with their weight gradually decreasing to approximately 61% of that of B6 mice at 52 weeks.</s><s>A significant decrease in body weight was observed after the onset of diabetes.</s><s>The two strains of mice had similar body mass index values at 25 weeks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>), indicating that the ihs mice were non-obese.</s><s>The analysis of body composition using the NMR method showed that the relative fat percentage was significantly lower in ihs mice, being approximately 47 and 20% of that of B6 mice at 25 and 52 weeks-of-age, respectively, with a concomitant increase in lean mass (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>These findings showed that the bodyweight reduction in ihs mice was largely due to decreased fat mass, thought to be associated with the onset of diabetes.</s></p><p><s>To assess whether the ihs mice were hyperphagic, the daily food intake was monitored in animals fed a standard chow diet ad libitum.</s><s>At 12 and 25 weeks, the ihs mice consumed approximately 50% more food than the controls, indicating marked hyperphagia (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>In addition, a significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in total water intake was observed in ihs mice throughout the experimental period (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>).</s><s>However, no proteinuria was observed and there were no obvious pathological changes in the glomeruli at 45 weeks-of-age in the male ihs mice (data not shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glucose tolerance and insulin response to oral glucose loading and sensitivity to insulin</head><p><s>To characterize the ihs mice in terms of systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin release in vivo, we carried out oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) on ihs and control mice.</s><s>At 10 weeks-ofage, there was no difference in fasting glucose levels between the ihs and control animals, but the male ihs mice showed typical glucose levels of ≥300 mg/dL, typical of diabetes, at 30-120 min after glucose loading (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>Although the female ihs mice showed normal blood glucose levels in the non-fasting state, they showed marked impairment in glucose tolerance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The glucose AUC values after glucose loading in male and female ihs mice were significantly higher than those in B6 mice.</s><s>Impaired glucose tolerance was observed in all male and female ihs mice with an exacerbation of glucose tolerance in an agedependent manner (Figure <ref type="figure">S1a,b</ref>).</s><s>Insulin concentrations were also measured during the OGTTs.</s><s>The non-fasting insulin levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) and the plasma insulin levels of the ihs and control mice before glucose administration were similar (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c,d</ref>).</s><s>After glucose loading, the ihs mice showed significantly lower insulin levels and the insulin AUC values were also lower (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c,d</ref>).</s><s>This suggested that ihs mice have defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at the early phase of diabetes.</s><s>Insulin release in vivo during the OGTTs was markedly impaired in male and female ihs mice, resulting in marked impairment in glucose tolerance.</s><s>The plasma GLP-1 levels after glucose loading in ihs mice was comparable with that of the control mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test for insulin sensitivity, we carried out insulin tolerance tests on ihs and control mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e,f</ref>).</s><s>The ihs mice showed a normal glycemic response to exogenous insulin and were not insulin-resistant.</s></p><p><s>Histological examination of pancreatic islets in male ihs mice Islets from mutant and control mice at 10-12 weeks-of-age were of similar size and shape with a smooth periphery (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>).</s><s>No inflammation or fibroblast proliferation was observed in the mutant mouse islets.</s><s>Immunostaining for insulin showed that insulin-positive cells were regularly distributed.</s><s>Furthermore, no differences in pancreatic insulin contents were observed between the mutant and control mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>), and the sizes of individual b-cells from the histological sections were similar in the mutant and control mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>).</s><s>Next, the volume of b-cells relative to the gross volume of the pancreas was determined to analyze sections that were immunostained for insulin.</s><s>In male ihs mice, the relative b-cell volume was significantly lower than that in the control B6 mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5d</ref>), and the ratio of a/b-cells in the ihs islets was significantly increased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5e</ref>).</s><s>In aged male and female ihs mice, the increase in a-cells was more pronounced (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4 and  S5</ref>); a marked decrease in the number of islets was observed only in aged male ihs mice.</s><s>In mouse islets under normal conditions, a-cells are localized in the islet periphery.</s><s>However, the pattern of peripheral distribution of a-cells seemed to be disrupted, and some a-cells were scattered throughout the islet core in the pancreas of ihs mice in a manner similar to that observed in diabetes models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insulin secretion from perfused pancreata and isolated islets</head><p><s>We hypothesized that abnormal insulin secretion was the cause of the hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia in the ihs mice.</s><s>To test this, we carried out perfusion experiments that examined the time-course of the insulin secretary response to high glucose.</s><s>In the control pancreata, a change in glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.5 mmol/L elicited strong peaks, with a 14-fold increase in insulin secretion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>).</s><s>As was expected from the results of the OGTTs, the elevation of glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.5 mmol/L in the pancreata of the ihs mice resulted in a fourfold increase in insulin secretion.</s><s>In the ihs mice, the AUC values of secreted insulin after glucose stimulation (from 10 to 26 min) was significantly impaired compared with that of the control mice (24.5 -9 vs 92.4 -13.1;</s><s>P &lt; 0.01; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Islet b-cell glucose metabolism is accompanied by closure of the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels followed by depolarization.</s><s>We therefore investigated insulin secretion in response to potassium chloride (KCl), a potent insulin secretagogue, to identify which steps in the insulin secretion pathway are impaired in ihs mice.</s><s>The ihs pancreata showed a significantly lower increase in insulin secretion compared with the control pancreata (an 8-fold increase vs a 47fold increase; P &lt; 0.05; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>), indicating a significant reduction in insulin secretion in the ihs mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>).</s><s>In the batch incubation experiment, the islets isolated from ihs mice also showed a significant decrease in insulin secretion compared with those isolated from control mice, when stimulated with glibenclamide, (antidiabetic drug of class sulfonylureas), which causes the b-cell depolarization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>These results showed that the insulin secretion capability of bcells was markedly impaired in ihs mice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of pancreatic b-cell gene expression in the islets of ihs and control mice</head><p><s>Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can be impaired after a reduction in the proteins involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion.</s><s>To determine whether the defect in insulin secretion in ihs mice was associated with abnormalities in gene transcription, the expression of pancreatic b-cell-specific genes or genes associated with monogenic diabetes was assessed by RT-qPCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>Most of these genes showed no change in expression in comparison with control mice.</s><s>However, Glp1r was significantly upregulated, and the expression levels of Glis3, Glut2, Wfs1 and Epac2 were downregulated, in the islets of the ihs mice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Animal models of diabetes that more closely recapitulate the features of the human disease would be useful for understanding the pathogenesis and developing new treatment strategies.</s><s>The ihs mice showed several distinctive diabetes-related characteristics: (i) the onset of diabetes was observed only in the male mice; (ii) there were no differences in insulin content between the ihs and control mice; (iii) impaired insulin secretion was elicited by glucose and KCl; (iv) there was a significant reduction of relative b-cell volume with no signs of inflammation or fibrosis; (v) they showed a normal glycemic response to exogenous insulin; and (vi) they were non-obese.</s><s>Nagoya-Shibata-Yasuda (NSY) mice, a type 2 diabetes model derived from ICR mice, showed phenotypes similar to that of ihs mice, such as severely impaired glucose tolerance, reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and differences in diabetes onset based on sex <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .</s><s>However, NSY mice showed an increase in the fasting plasma insulin levels, insulin resistance and hypertrophy of pancreatic islets, whereas ihs mice had normal fasting plasma  insulin levels and insulin sensitivity, and showed the relative bcell volume was lower than that in control mice.</s><s>Furthermore, the incidence of diabetes in the female NSY mice was 31% at 48 weeks, whereas the female ihs mice did not develop diabetes, although female ihs mice have impaired glucose tolerance.</s><s>Therefore, we concluded that the ihs mouse was a novel murine model for non-obese type 2 diabetes.</s><s>The release of insulin from pancreatic b-cells is regulated by highly complex and sophisticated mechanisms, modulated by many factors, including hormones, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>With respect to the mechanism in b-cells, we showed that Glut2, Wfs1 and Epac2 expression levels were significantly downregulated (by 50%) in the islets of the ihs mice, and that Glp1r expression was increased threefold.</s><s>The GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) is expressed mainly in the alimentary tract, particularly in the pancreatic islet cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , where it mediates the actions of GLP-1 released from the small intestines in response to food intake.</s><s>GLP-1 is considered to be one of the most important glucose-dependent insulin secretagogues <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , and is known to cause a rise in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>The GLP1R, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is involved in insulin secretion through mechanisms dependent on and independent of PKA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>GLP-1 stimulates the expression of glucose transporter 2, which determines the rate of glycolysis and helps to confer the glucose competence to b-cells, thereby increasing the efficacy and potency of glucose as a stimulus for insulin secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>It has been reported that WFS1 is essential for GLP-1stimulated cAMP production, and the regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In pancreatic b-cells, cAMP signaling, which can be activated by various extracellular stimuli, including hormonal and neural inputs primarily through Gprotein-coupled receptors, is vital for the normal regulation of insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis.</s><s>The activation of cAMP signaling amplifies insulin secretion dependent on exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>EPAC2 is essential in the potentiation of insulin granule exocytosis by cAMP, primarily in the first phase of cAMP-potentiated exocytosis, by increasing the number of restless newcomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Although the plasma GLP-1 concentration was comparable with the control mouse (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), the unresponsiveness of the pathway induced by GLP1R activation might cause the upregulation of Glp1r, and downregulation of Glut2, Wfs1 and Epac2 expression in the ihs mouse.</s><s>A high concentration of KCl and sulfonylureas can directly cause depolarization of the b-cell plasma membrane, which subsequently triggers an influx of Ca 2+ and insulin granule exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>This indicates that the defective insulin release induced by KCl in the perfusion experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) and by glibenclamide in batch incubation experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>) was not caused by a defect in GLP-1 signaling.</s><s>The causative gene for insulin hyposecretion in the ihs mouse is not involved in incretin-potentiated insulin secretion.</s><s>However, the GLP-1 signal elevates cytosolic Ca 2+ in b-cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the significant upregulation of Glp1r and marked impairment of insulin secretion stimulated by glucose and KCl might be caused by a defect in the Ca 2+ signaling pathway in the b-cells of the ihs mice.</s><s>Although relative b-cell volume of ihs mice decreased to almost 60% of that of the B6 mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5d</ref>), no differences were observed in the insulin content of the pancreata and in the bcell size between the ihs and control mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b,c</ref>), and insulin 1 and 2 mRNA levels were similar in the two strains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>This suggests the possibility that more insulin granules are stocked in each b-cell of ihs mice.</s><s>Therefore, we concluded that the marked dysfunction in insulin secretion observed in the ihs mice at a young age was not caused by a defect in the insulin production or islet architecture and organization, but by a defect in the Ca 2+ influx and/or Ca 2+ signaling pathway in b-cells.</s></p><p><s>The incidence of diabetes in the male ihs mice was 90% at 42 weeks-of-age; in contrast, none of the female mice developed diabetes, even though the female ihs mice showed impaired glucose tolerance and the impairment of glucose-induced insulin secretion (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b,d and S1b</ref>).</s><s>In the present study, we found that the relative b-cell volume in the male ihs mice was lower than that in age-matched B6 mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5d</ref>), and progressively decreased with aging (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, marked reduction of islets was not observed in aged female ihs mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5</ref>).</s><s>It seemed that the reduction of islets in aged male ihs mice was influenced by glucotoxicity.</s><s>Additionally, glucagon-positive acells were evenly distributed along the periphery of the islets in the control mice.</s><s>However, a relative increase in a-cells along the periphery and in the central core of the islet was more evident with aging in the male and female ihs mice (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4 and S5</ref>).</s><s>A relative increase in a-cells has been reported in many animal models with b-cell deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , as well as in patients with type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>This is thought to result from the collapse of the central b-cell core due to the loss of b-cells rather than from acell hyperplasia.</s><s>A similar sex difference has been observed in a variety of diabetic cases in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>In addition, many knockout and transgenic models of diabetes show a sex bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , and the protective effect of estradiol against the development of insulin resistance and diabetes has been widely discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>We assume that estrogen and prolactin play a protective role in female rodents, as they have a regulatory influence on b-cell function <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> and proliferation rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying this sex bias.</s><s>Models of spontaneous diabetes are invaluable for the identification of unknown diabetogenic genes.</s><s>The ihs mouse model involves neither obesity nor insulitis, but is accompanied by notable pancreatic b-cell dysfunction, which distinguishes it from other well-characterized animal models.</s><s>Although further genetic analysis is required to allow a better understanding of the molecular pathology of ihs mice, our preliminary exome sequencing analysis from ICGN mice and genetic analysis in ihs mice showed no non-synonymous, nonsense or frameshift mutations in the known genes responsible for monogenic diabetes characterized by b-cell failure in humans and rodents.</s><s>This suggests that the ihs strain can contribute to the discovery of novel causative genes, potentially leading to the development of treatment strategies for hypoinsulinemia and diabetes.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>6 Figure 1 |</head><label>61</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 | The pedigree of insulin hyposecretion
