<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Identification of CHIKV pro-and anti-viral factors.</s><s>A host genome-wide loss-of-function screen was performed by reversely transfecting a genome-wide library of B60,000 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting B17,000 annotated and B6,000 predicted genes into CHIKV-permissive human cells (HEK-293) for 3 days.</s><s>Transfected cells were infected with a recombinant CHIKV-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CHIKV-GFP) in infected cells.</s><s>At 18 h post infection (p.i.), cells were fixed and analysed by automatic fluorescence microscopy to quantify the ratio of infected to uninfected cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>To reduce the number of false-positive hits, 7,561 non-expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) and 3,274 toxic siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b,c</ref>) were excluded following transcriptional microarray and viability analyses, respectively.</s><s>RNAi data were then analysed statistically using cellHTS2 (ref.</s><s>15), and normalized using as positive control, an siRNA targeting the viral E1 gene, and as negative control AllStars siRNA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>).</s><s>A Z-score transformation was applied to center and scale the plate-wise data (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>), and the medians of resulting values of at least three independent replicates were used for redundant siRNA activity (RSA) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Using RSA log P values of r À 2 as cutoff, we identified 279 proviral and 269 antiviral factors (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e,f</ref>).</s><s>To minimize off-target false positives, we further validated these hits with three additional siRNAs per gene.</s><s>On the basis of the calculated cSSMD (collective strictly standardized mean difference) values, which reflect effect strength and significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g,h</ref>), we validated 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>; Supplementary Data 1 and 2).</s><s>Strikingly, 66 of these proviral genes have been identified in previous screens with influenza A virus (IAV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , HCV <ref type="bibr"

type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>; see Supplementary Data 3 for details and references).</s><s>Moreover, 16 factors are relevant for multiple viruses (white boxes in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>), therefore representing the central biological nodes for broadspectrum antiviral therapeutic intervention.</s></p><p><s>To definitely validate these 16 factors, we used an independent method, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, to generate cells deficient for each of these genes.</s><s>We observed a significant reduction of CHIKV replication with guide RNAs (gRNA)-transduced Cas9expressing cells for 14 out of 16 genes, establishing that they are proviral factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>,e; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1i,j</ref>; Supplementary Data 4) and highlighting the strong reliability of the RNAi-validated hits of our study.</s><s>Among the proviral factors, the three largest protein-protein interaction networks are involved in transcription, translation and signalling, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1k</ref>).</s><s>Gene enrichment analysis revealed biological processes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>) and molecular functions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) required for infection, including cell metabolism, post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, and cellular function and maintenance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>Genes associated with lipid metabolism, in particular fatty acid synthesis, were statistically overrepresented within the hits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Fatty acid synthesis is required for CHIKV replication.</s><s>Cytosolic fatty acid synthesis involves the following three enzymes: (i) ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), needed for the formation of acetyl CoA, (ii) acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), which transforms acetyl CoA into malonyl CoA, and (iii) fatty acid synthase (FASN), which converts acetyl and malonyl CoA into palmitate (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>Both FASN and ACLY were unambiguous hits (Figs 1b and 3a; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, FASN activity is required for the replication of other enveloped viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> and both the enzymes are present in late replication complexes (Rc) of a closely related alphavirus (Semliki Forest virus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>To analyse the functional implication of lipid metabolism in CHIKV replication, we used a CHIKV replicon, allowing measurement of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA (vRNA) expression simultaneously (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the screening results, the expression of both the vRNA forms was impaired in HeLa cells depleted in either FASN or ACLY, but not in cells depleted in ACC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b,c</ref>).</s><s>Immunofluorescence analysis further showed that Rc co-localized with FASN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>,e; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>).</s><s>We next independently confirmed these results pharmacologically.</s><s>Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin (FASN inhibitor), 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA, ACC inhibitor), BMS-303141 (ACLY inhibitor) or vehicle only (dimethylsulphoxide, DMSO).</s><s>All three inhibitors induced a significant and dosedependent reduction in genomic and subgenomic vRNA synthesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3f</ref>), with no deleterious effect on cell viability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3g</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results show that fatty acid synthesis is necessary for CHIKV vRNA replication.</s></p><p><s>Rational identification of antiviral drugs.</s><s>On the basis of the demonstration of the antiviral activity of all lipid biosynthesis inhibitors targeting the proviral factors identified by the host genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we next considered all the other hits as putative drug targets.</s><s>Therefore, to exploit the translational potential of our screen, we systematically assessed the antiviral activity of chemical compounds targeting the identified proviral factors involved in CHIKV replication.</s><s>We interrogated specialized databases (www.drugbank.ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>; lincs.hms.harvard.edu/kinomescan <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>; www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ), linking several drugs to their experimentally proven target proteins/genes, and identified 52 compounds interacting with the gene products of 14 distinct CHIKV proviral genes.</s><s>In addition, we generated three compounds against the CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), a proviral factor for CHIKV, IAV and WNV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>; Supplementary Data 3; Supplementary Methods).</s><s>Of these, 20 compounds-8 of them already Food and Drug Administration approved-interacting with six distinct proviral factors or pathways (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) potently inhibited CHIKV replication with no significant toxicity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>; Supplementary Data 5).</s><s>These antiviral compounds inhibit the following targets and pathways: (i) the vacuolar-type H þ ATPase (vATPase); (ii) CLK1; (iii) the fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4 or VEGFR3); (iv) calmodulin signalling; (v) fatty acid synthesis; (vi) the K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5 or TIP60; see Supplementary Data 6 for more
