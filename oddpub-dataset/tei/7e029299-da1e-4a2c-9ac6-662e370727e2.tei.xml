<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In 1985, a frozen mummy was found in Cerro Aconcagua (Argentina).</s><s>Archaeological studies identified the mummy as a seven-year-old Inca sacrifice victim who lived &gt;500 years ago, at the time of the expansion of the Inca Empire towards the southern cone.</s><s>The sequence of its entire mitogenome was obtained.</s><s>After querying a large worldwide database of mitogenomes (&gt;28,000) we found that the Inca haplotype belonged to a branch of haplogroup C1b (C1bi) that has not yet been identified in modern Native Americans.</s><s>The expansion of C1b into the Americas, as estimated using 203 C1b mitogenomes, dates to the initial Paleoindian settlements (~18.3 thousand years ago [kya]); however, its internal variation differs between Mesoamerica and South America.</s><s>By querying large databases of control region haplotypes (&gt;150,000), we found only a few C1bi members in Peru and Bolivia (e.g.</s><s>Aymaras), including one haplotype retrieved from ancient DNA of an individual belonging to the Wari Empire (Peruvian Andes).</s><s>Overall, the results suggest that the profile of the mummy represents a very rare sub-clade that arose 14.3 (5-23.6)</s><s>kya and could have been more frequent in the past.</s><s>A Peruvian Inca origin for present-day C1bi haplotypes would satisfy both the genetic and paleo-anthropological findings.</s></p><p><s>In the summer of 1985 a group of mountaineers discovered a frozen mummy only partially unearthed at an altitude of 5,300 meters in the southwestern edge of the Aconcagua Mountain ("Cerro"), at the base of the Pirámide Mountain, in the Argentinean province of Mendoza.</s><s>Instead of excavating the body, the mountaineers returned to their localities and informed specialists about this find.</s><s>Excavations were subsequently carried out by professional archaeologists.</s><s>In the ritual burial, archaeologists identified a very well preserved seven-year-old boy wrapped in numerous textiles and surrounded by six statuettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>A range of archaeological and anthropological studies identified the mummy as the victim of an Inca sacrifice, a ritual known as "capacocha", occurring approximately 500 years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The ceremony (also known as "capac hucha") involved the ritual sacrifice of children and it is interpreted today as one of several strategies used by the Inca state to integrate and control its vast civilization.</s><s>The sacrificial rites involved children of great physical beauty and health in honor of the gods; the rituals were performed during or after important events (death of an emperor, the birth of a royal son, a victory in battle or an annual or biennial event in the Inca calendar), or in response to catastrophes (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and epidemics) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>The children were selected from different locations throughout the Inca territories and taken to the high mountaintops for capacocha.</s></p><p><s>The Inca constituted the largest (about 12 million people) and one of the most complex civilizations in pre-Columbian America.</s><s>Its political, administrative and military center was located in Cusco (modern-day Peru).</s><s>The Inca arose in the highlands of Peru in the early 13 th century.</s><s>From 1438 to 1533 they conquered or peacefully assimilated a large portion of western South America, including present-day Peru, a large part of Ecuador, south-central Bolivia, southern Colombia, northwest Argentina, and north-central/north Chile.</s><s>The Aconcagua mummy dates to this period of expansion southwards, and was found close to the southernmost edge of the Inca expansion.</s><s>There is abundant archaeological evidence supporting the practice of sacrifice within Inca society <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>The last emperor of the Incas (Atahuallpa) was executed in 1533 by the soldiers of the Spanish conqueror Francisco Pizarro, marking the end of 300 years of Inca civilization.</s></p><p><s>The analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) flourished in the last decade with the arrival of new sequencing technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> .</s><s>However, relatively few genetic studies have been carried out on mummies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> .</s><s>Ermini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> analyzed the Tyrolean Iceman, a 46-year-old man who lived in the Neolithic-Copper Age transition in Central Europe about 5 kya; this represented the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a prehistoric European.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few studies carried out on Native American mummies; all of them only targeted the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) first hypervariable region (HVS-I).</s><s>For instance, Monsalve et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> analyzed the Kwäday Dän Ts'ìchi ancient remains of a man found in a melting glacier in British Columbia (Canada); the authors could characterize his mtDNA as belonging to haplogroup A, and found matches in populations from across the whole American continent.</s><s>Wilson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> analyzed samples from another Inca child sacrifice employing a multidisciplinary approach.</s><s>These authors reported the mtDNA HVS-I and a few mtDNA SNPs from seven samples, allowing them to broadly allocate these haplotypes to Native American haplogroups C and D. The HVS-I segment of the remains of the mummy "Juanita" (also known as "Lady of Ampato" or "Inca Ice Maiden") was published in GenBank (Acc.</s><s>No. EF660742 and EF660743); this was identified as another Inca sacrifice victim: a 12-14-year-old child who lived in Mount Ampato (near Arequipa, Peru) about 500 years ago; its mtDNA haplotype could be allocated to haplogroup A (its sequence motif is widespread across the whole American continent).</s></p><p><s>The present study represents the first attempt at reporting the entire mtDNA of a Native American mummy, with the additional interest that this mummy represents a member of the Inca civilization.</s><s>The main aim is to shed light on the genetic variation existing at the time of the Inca civilization and to interpret this variation in the light of the patterns observed in present-day populations.</s></p></div>
