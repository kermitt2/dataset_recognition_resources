<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY Participants and procedures</head><p><s>This was a cross-sectional study conducted in February 2014 among parents bringing their healthy children, aged 2 years and below, to two National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (Singapore has a total of 18 polyclinics) for their well-child health visits, which may include developmental assessment and/or vaccinations.</s><s>The take-up rate of this programme for children up to 2 years is more than 97%, providing a good representation of the children in the region at a given point in time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref></s><s>Parents satisfying the eligibility criteria were invited to participate in the study.</s><s>Participants who were not Singapore citizens were excluded and verbal consent from the participants was obtained.</s><s>After consent was obtained, trained interviewers administered survey questionnaires in a standardised form in the participants' preferred language (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil) during clinic visits.</s></p><p><s>This study was approved by the Singapore National Health Care Group Domain Specific Review Boards (DSRBs).</s><s>Participation was entirely voluntary and informed consent was received from all the parents or caregivers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p><s>The study questionnaire was developed following a comprehensive literature review and refined through pilot studies.</s><s>Interviewers were trained to ensure consistent administration of the survey questionnaires.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SV behaviour</head><p><s>Parents were asked to provide information about the amount of screen time their child was exposed to during weekdays and weekends.</s><s>Parental recall of their child's SV time has been shown to be reliable, correlating well within previous observational studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref></s><s>SV behaviour was ascertained in four broad device categories: TV/ digital video disc, computer, video game consoles and mobile devices (including smartphones, tablets and other portable devices).</s><s>To determine total SV, the amount of time spent on individual device categories was added up for weekdays and weekends with weights corresponding to 5/7 and 2/7, respectively.</s><s>Subsequently, total SV time during the entire week was calculated.</s><s>Each device-specific SV time was determined in the same way but only including information for respective devices.</s></p><p><s>Two SV statuses are presented, (1) 'any SV per day', and (2) 'SV ≥2 h/day' on any device, as well as for different screen devices.</s><s>The second SV status is based on previously cited SV recommendations that indicate that even older children should not engage in more than 2 h of SV per day.</s><s>We therefore chose this cut-off to indicate 'heavy' SV exposure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent variables</head><p><s>Sociodemographic information of the parent was recorded, including ethnicity, parents' education, parental marital status and household income, together with the child's age and gender.</s><s>The screen environment at home was determined by assessing the number of functioning screen devices at home.</s><s>The number of screen devices was recorded separately for each device type.</s><s>Parental knowledge of professional SV recommendations for children under the age of 2 years was categorised into three categories: minimise SV altogether, less than 2 h of SV time, and ≥2 h of SV time.</s><s>Parental SV was determined and summarised in the same way as for children.</s><s>Total parental SV time was categorised according to tertiles.</s></p><p><s>Parental rule setting practices focused on whether parents set rules on the time (duration per day) and the programme (content) of their child's SV, respectively.</s><s>These variables were combined ( parents who set rules on both time and type of programme vs parents who did not set rules on time and programme) because of the strong association between both variables.</s><s>The exact daily SV time permitted according to parental rules was further assessed and categorised into four groups: 'no SV rules', 'SV time ≥2 h' rule, 'SV time of less than 2 h' rule and 'no SV time' rule.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>For categorical variables, counts and percentages were reported while for continuous variables, the median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were reported.</s><s>To assess association between categorical variables, the χ 2 or Fisher exact tests were used where appropriate.</s><s>The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess association between continuous and categorical variables.</s><s>Multiple logistic regression was used to model two representations of SV status, 'any SV per day' and 'SV of ≥2 h/day' (representing 'heavy users'), where sociodemographic factors, parental knowledge and practices were the independent variables.</s><s>In these analyses, both rule setting characteristics (time and programme) were combined as 'parents that set rules on time and type of programme'.</s><s>To further explore the association with specific types of rules and the strictness of rules on time (with regard to the permitted duration of SV per day), multiple logistic regression analysis was performed separately for 'rules on time', 'rules on programme' and the strictness of rules on time in terms of the permitted SV time.</s><s>The OR, its 95% CI and p values were reported.</s><s>A p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</s><s>The statistical analysis was carried out using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences and Stata V.12.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>All 1061 parent-child dyads visiting the assessment sites during the assessment periods were approached.</s><s>Of them, 794 met the inclusion criteria and 725 (91.3%) provided consent, participated in the survey and provided complete information on the outcome variables of SV time.</s></p><p><s>Child and parental characteristics of the study population are presented in table 1. Findings show that 55.3% of children were male and the majority (58.6%) were of Chinese ethnicity with the remainder being mostly of Malay or Indian ethnicity.</s><s>The median age of the children was 7 (IQR 10) months with 44.7% being younger than 6 months and 55.3% being 6-24 months old.</s><s>The majority of parents were married (98.1%)</s><s>where 79.5% of fathers and 76.0% of mothers had attained an educational level of postsecondary school and above.</s><s>The majority of households (81.1%) had a monthly income of SG$3000 (where SG$3000 is approximately US$2011) or more.</s></p><p><s>The most common screen devices in households were mobile devices with a median of four devices per household, followed by TVs and computer.</s><s>Video game consoles were considerably less common.</s><s>With regard to the knowledge about professional SV recommendations, only 12.7% of parents were aware that SV in children below the age of 2 should be minimised and almost twice as many parents (26%) believed that the recommended duration was 2 h or more per day as recommended by guidelines.</s><s>About 80% of parents set rules on time or programme of SV, and about 75% set rules on both time and programme.</s><s>Although more than 10% of parents appeared to know that SV should be minimised according to professional SV recommendations, less than 5% among parents set rules to minimise SV.</s><s>More than 75% of parents with rules on SV time set rules of less than 2 h SV per day (or 63% among all 725 parents).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SV behaviour</head><p><s>The prevalence of daily SV among children is presented in detail in table 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study investigated SV patterns and their correlates in very young children, considering multiple different screen device types, including TV, computer, as well as mobile screen devices and video game consoles.</s><s>Given the widespread use, especially of mobile screen devices in day-to-day life, this comprehensive approach is important to fully understand SV patterns.</s><s>Based on a recent systematic review of the literature, this study is the first in young children to investigate SV patterns and their correlates in such detail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref></s><s>ur findings show that among children up to the age of 2, SV on a daily basis is very common.</s><s>Even in children aged less than 6 months, about 30% were engaging daily in SV and by the age of 18-24 months, about 90% of children engaged in daily SV activities.</s><s>We made similar observations with regard to SV time, so that by the age of 18-24 months the median SV time was almost 1.5 h/day and almost 1/3 of the children were engaging in 2 or more hours of SV time per day.</s><s>Our findings are consistent with research from other countries that have previously reported high exposure to TV, computer and videos at young ages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref></s><s>lthough TVs still appear to be the most common form of screen devices young children are exposed to, our findings also highlight that TVs are not the only relevant screen device children are using.</s><s>Mobile devices have become widely available in the entire population and they now seem to reflect the second most important source of SV in very young children.</s><s>Furthermore, we noted that the difference in the prevalence between TV and mobile devices is least pronounced at the age of 18-24 months when compared with younger age groups making SV attributable to mobile devices comparable with that with TVs.</s><s>Moreover, in terms of the SV time, we noted a significant difference across age groups for total SV and mobile devices but not for TVs or other screen devices.</s><s>Previous studies from the USA and Europe, targeting older children, have also reported on the frequent use of mobile devices.</s><s>Besides age, we noted that Malay, Indian and other ethnic groups were considerably more likely to engage in any SV and 2 or more hours of SV per day as compared with Chinese.</s><s>This is consistent with existing literature that also reported ethnic differences in SV in Western populations. <ref type="bibr">31 34</ref></s><s>On the other hand, we did not identify significant associations between daily SV or SV of 2 or more hours per day and other sociodemographic variables, such as child's gender, mother's or father's educational level, income and parental marital status, when taking potential confounders into consideration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref></s><s>arental knowledge and parenting practices may have the potential to reflect targets for health promotion strategies to reduce or delay the update of SV in very young children.</s><s>Our study found strong and consistent associations between child SV and parental rule setting practices.</s><s>Findings indicate that children are less likely to engage in SV if parents set rules on SV time, and additionally if the rules on SV time are stricter.</s><s>On the other hand, rules on programmes did not appear to be significantly associated with SV in children.</s><s>A recent systematic review of the literature reported mixed and less consistent findings of such TV policies at home.</s><s>However, this review summarised studies of very different methodology and, importantly, mostly targeted older children and adolescents.</s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref> Our findings are similar to previous research in older children, however, that also indicated that the type of rules (time or programme) may have implications in terms of SV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">37</ref> In addition to rule setting practices, knowledge of professional SV recommendations and parental SV behaviour was significantly associated with SV in children, particularly with viewing 2 or more hours per day.</s><s>These findings seem to be consistent with studies conducted in older children and adolescents that reported associations between children's and parental SV. <ref type="bibr">27 31 38</ref> Our study has a number of strengths, including a very high participation rate and detailed outcome assessments.</s><s>Building on Singapore's National Childhood Immunization programme facilitated this study of a defined population of healthy children aged 2 and below.</s><s>Some limitations, however, have to be acknowledged.</s><s>First, the survey recruited from 2 out of the 18 polyclinics covering the whole of Singapore.</s><s>Variations in the overall population reflected in the other centres may hence be unaccounted for.</s><s>Second, this is a crosssectional study which limits its ability to draw inferences about the direction of cause and effect.</s><s>However, modern screen devices, in particular tablets, have only become widely used after the launch of the iPad in 2010.</s><s>Hence, at this stage, longitudinal data on the use and determinants of modern screen devices are not available.</s><s>Third, the study was conducted in February and may not reflect seasonal variations in screen time exposure, although seasonal variation in weather is limited in tropical Singapore.</s><s>Fourth, our study relied on a proxy report.</s><s>While questionnaires were developed on the basis of the existing literature and extensively piloted, they were not validated and we were not able to determine SV objectively.</s><s>This could introduce measurement bias.</s><s>Finally, we did not distinguish between the type    of programme screen time was spent on or whether it was, for instance, spent for video calling with family members.</s><s>This will be important to consider in future studies because research has indicated that health consequences may vary depending on the activity performed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">39</ref></s><s>ur findings have considerable public health implications because they highlight the importance of targeting SV practices at a very early age, ideally even during the first 6 months of life in order to develop appropriate practices to prevent the update of these activities in the first place.</s><s>Our study also showed that TV viewing still seems to be the most common but not the only relevant screen device young children are exposed to.</s><s>With increasing age, mobile devices take up an increasing part of total SV time, and by the age of 18-24 months are almost as prevalent as TVs.</s><s>Different devices may require different intervention strategies and recommendations, given their portability, small size and multifunctional usability (eg, watching videos, playing games, reading, listening to audiobooks).</s><s>We were able to identify a number of potentially modifiable factors that were strongly associated with SV practices in children, including parental knowledge of professional SV recommendations, parental SV and rule setting practices and, to a lesser degree, the number of devices in the household.</s><s>These findings were particularly present in the case of heavy SV, which suggests that reducing SV behaviour in young children might be an achievable target, while replacing SV entirely could be more challenging.</s><s>Modifiable factors offer opportunities for health promotion strategies, administered for instance by healthcare professionals during developmental assessments or teachers in childcare centres at a very young age.</s><s>This could help to delay and reduce SV in children.</s><s>Our findings are consistent with earlier publications that reported a high prevalence of regular TV viewing in very young children. <ref type="bibr">19 20 22 40</ref></s><s>However, our findings expand the existing literature considerably in various aspects.</s><s>Importantly, we were able to investigate multiple up-to-date screen device types and a broad spectrum of sociodemographic, environmental, parental knowledge and practices related correlates of SV in very young children.</s><s>In addition, literature reviews have shown that the bulk of the existing evidence comes from the USA and Europe, with a very limited number of studies from Asian countries, despite the rapid economic development and increasing concerns about the increase in non-communicable diseases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref></s><s>n conclusion, our study found a high prevalence of SV overall.</s><s>Within the first 2 years of a child's life, the prevalence of SV increased across age groups.</s><s>By the age of 2 years, almost all children were exposed to screen devices daily and a substantial proportion of this young study population exceeded 2 h of SV, usually recommended as the maximum for much older children.</s><s>While TV viewing remains the most common contributor to overall SV in children, our findings also confirm the increasingly important role of mobile screen devices.</s><s>Strategies aimed at reducing the rapid uptake of regular SV practices in children are urgently needed to influence future behaviours and health.</s><s>We were able to identify potential targets for such strategies, especially for SV or 2 or more hours per day, including parental knowledge regarding professional SV recommendations, parental SV practices and the implementation of strict rules on SV time in young children.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1
