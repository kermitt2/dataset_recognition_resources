<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Procedures and Treatment</head><p><s>Eligible patients were treated with veliparib or placebo at 120 mg orally twice daily on days 1 to 7 of each 3-week cycle.</s><s>Carboplatin and paclitaxel were given on day 3 of each treatment cycle.</s><s>Carboplatin was dosed to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve of 6 mg/mL/min according to the Calvert formula, and paclitaxel was given at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 .</s><s>Treatments were continued to six cycles (no maintenance chemotherapy), unless discontinued for disease progression, clinical deterioration of the patient, pregnancy, withdrawal of informed consent, concomitant medical conditions limiting further therapy, or investigator's decision to discontinue therapy on the basis of the best interests of the patient.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The findings of this prespecified analysis of smokers demonstrate that recent smokers treated with veliparib derive significantly greater PFS and OS benefits, as well as higher ORR and DOR, compared with patients treated with only carboplatin/paclitaxel. Smokers had similar magnitudes of benefit irrespective of whether they had low or high levels of cotinine.</s><s>Exploratory analysis of veliparib benefit according to pack-years of smoking showed similar results, although there is no validation set in which to formally examine this observation.</s><s>These improvements in outcomes in the veliparibchemotherapy combination group versus in the chemotherapy-alone group concur with results reported for the overall population (squamous or nonsquamous), with greater benefit for the squamous histologic subgroup. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref></s><s>This study also showed that smoking history is a strong independent predictor for the efficacy of veliparib in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel as a first-line therapy in advanced NSCLC.</s></p><p><s>AE rates were higher in the veliparib group than in those receiving placebo independent of the population analyzed (overall population and current smokers).</s><s>Though partially apparent in the incidence of anemia, alopecia, and leukopenia, many other specific events reflected this difference.</s><s>For all grades, the rates of neutropenia and arthralgia were similar across the overall population and current smokers but higher in veliparib-treated than placebo-treated patients.</s><s>The observed AEs in recent smokers were manageable and generally consistent with toxicities of patients with lung cancer who receive treatment with veliparib.</s></p><p><s>The consistent veliparib benefit observed in the two cotinine cohorts suggests that the efficacy of veliparib in smokers is not dependent on tobacco exposure during study treatment.</s><s>PK data did not significantly vary in the cohorts with high and low cotinine levels, indicating there were no changes in drug exposure.</s><s>The observation that recent smokers, as opposed to former smokers or never-smokers, benefit from veliparib treatment is of interest and contrasts with what is seen in patients with lung cancer treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy or with other targeted agents.</s></p><p><s>A number of trials have demonstrated that patients with solid tumors who are active smokers at diagnosis have poorer treatment outcomes than their nonsmoker counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24</ref></s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[28]</ref> Targeted agents used in lung cancer, such as erlotinib, afatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib, predominantly exhibit efficacy in patients who have never smoked and harbor oncogenic activating mutations of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK).</s><s>There are very few reports of their use in patients who are currently smokers.</s><s>However, a converse association has been observed with immunotherapies, as they tend to perform better in patients with a history of prior smoking.</s><s>Currently, this effect is hypothesized to be based on a higher mutational burden in these patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29</ref></s><s>apidly proliferating cancers, such as lung cancer, tend to be genetically unstable and exhibit divergent genomic instability processes over time.</s><s>This may lead to the appearance of various mutations that result in defective DNA repair, and may lead to more aggressive tumor behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">30</ref></s><s>For smokers, the inhalation of tobacco smoke and its associated procarcinogens and carcinogens contribute to the process of mutagenesis and can accelerate and/or promote genetic instability, which contributes to worsened outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">31</ref></s><s>This is evidenced by the observation that a greater mutational burden is seen in smoking-related versus non-smoking-related lung cancers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>In the exploratory biomarker analyses of the limited sequencing data cohort in this study, smoking history was associated with the presence of mutational signature 4, a pattern consistent with smoking history in larger reference genomic data sets in NSCLC, as well as in other tumor types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Signature 4 shows transcriptional strand bias for C&gt;A change, which is likely the imprint of the bulky DNA adducts generated by polycyclic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke and their removal by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">32</ref></s><s>This C&gt;A transversion is characteristic of smoking-related genotoxicity and indicates an increased mutational burden in those who have smoked.</s><s>PARP inhibitors have previously been used to successfully target DNA repair pathways in patients with breast cancer 1/2 gene (BRCA)-associated cancers (e.g., Tutt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">33</ref> ), and they are believed to be a valid approach to prevent and/or treat genomic instability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">34</ref></s><s>Consequently, the observed efficacy of veliparib in recent smokers may reflect the effect of this drug on DNA repair pathways and in reducing genomic instability.</s><s>Analysis of limited sequencing data from this study did not show a strong association of mutational burden and veliparib benefit, suggesting that a different measure of genomic instability may be needed to identify a set of tumors susceptible to veliparib therapy.</s></p><p><s>The results presented herein are a post hoc subanalysis of the original trial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref></s><s>Hence, the sample size is small and care must be taken when drawing conclusions.</s><s>The whole exome data set is small, and this precludes conclusive comparison between treatment arms.</s><s>However, it is noteworthy that the reported sequencing data are consistent with other large-scale lung cancer sequencing projects.</s><s>Although the association between smoking and PARP inhibitor benefit is not clearly understood, data from additional trials may be used to further define the relationships among number of smoking events, timing of smoking start and smoking cessation, mutational burden, and response to therapy.</s><s>Phase 3 trials with larger sample sizes are under way to further evaluate these observations and may better define the group of smokers most likely to benefit (squamous histologic subtype [M11-089, NCT02106546] or nonsquamous histologic subtype [M14-359, NCT02264990]).</s><s>The primary end point in both studies is to assess the outcomes in recent smokers.</s><s>Data from these trials will be used to make informed decisions about the use of veliparib in these patient populations.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Veliparib pharmacokinetics (PK) by
