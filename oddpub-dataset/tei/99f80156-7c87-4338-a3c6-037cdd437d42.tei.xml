underlined the high degree of fragmentation occurred to this molecule upon digestion, and thus its high susceptibility to GI enzymes.</s><s>In addition, peptides assigned to other allergenic proteins were identified in the low MW fraction of digested raw almonds, such as Pru du 3, Pru du 4, Pru du 5 and Pru 2S Albumin, which probably were not highlighted in the electrophoretic pattern because of the low MW of intact proteins (9, 14, 11 and 12 kDa, respectively).</s><s>Pru du Allergenic Protein (AP) (also named Pru du γ-conglutin, original MW 45 kDa) was also identified in the low MW protein fraction of raw almonds, confirming the susceptibility of this allergen to digestive enzymes.</s><s>Proteins identified in this fraction corresponding to autoclaved and prehydrated/autoclaved digested almonds were similar to that reported in raw almond digests, although a different number of peptides was found for each allergen (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, in comparison with the raw almond digests, the number of unique peptides attributed to Pru du 6 remained stable in autoclaved samples, but increased in prehydrated/autoclaved samples, suggesting that the combined effect of both and the presence of digestive enzymes lead to a higher fragmentation of the protein.</s><s>A different trend was found for Pru du 3, Pru du 4, Pru du 5 and Pru du AP where total peptides number appeared to decrease when passing from raw to treated almond digests (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>It should be hypothesized that heat/pressure effect, combined with the proteolytic activity of digestive enzymes, promoted the extensive degradation of peptides down to fragment lower that 5 AA in length, which were missed by the software-based identification, resulting in a reduced number of total detected peptides.</s><s>As for Pru du 2S albumin, no difference in peptide number was displayed between raw and processed samples, likely due to a high resistance of the protein to the investigated treatments.</s><s>In general, these results complemented the information provided by Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, supporting the previous observation made on the electrophoretic profiles of undigested and digested almonds.</s><s>As discussed above, the content of prunin (Pru du 6), particularly abundant in the undigested electrophoretic profile, disappeared upon gastro-duodenal digestion and as a confirmation, in this low MW fraction, a large number of peptides belonging to this protein was detected.</s><s>Similar results were obtained in almonds thermally/pressure treated (with previous hydration or not) demonstrating that these technological approaches did not impair the final digestibility of almond allergens.</s><s>On the contrary, in some cases, they improved the protein fragmentation, with probable potential influence in the final allergenicity.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating the digestibility of almond proteins after thermal/pressure treatment.</s><s>The digestibility of blanched almond proteins was studied by Mandalari et al. in 2014, and, similarly to the results reported here, no significant differences were observed between the kinetics of digestion of natural and blanched almond proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. List of proteins identified by HPLC-MS/MS analysis followed by bioinformatic search via commercial software of low molecular weight fraction (&lt;6 kDa) isolated from raw almond digest of (CTRL-GI), autoclaved (AC10-GI) and prehydrated autoclaved almond (H 2 O-AC-GI) along with the relevant parameters provided by software.</s><s>As known, food processing may induce physical or chemical modifications that deeply affect the final structure/ conformation of a proteins, often altering their final digestibility, that is strictly linked with their potential immunoreactivity.</s><s>In light of this, the final section of our work was aimed at investigating the immunoreactive potential of the digested almond proteins raw and treated with autoclave (with or without hydration), scouting for full-length linear epitopes encrypted by the identified resistant peptide sequences, by means of bioinformatics tools.</s><s>All peptides contained in the low MW fraction of the duodenal digest were taken into consideration.</s><s>The IEDB database was screened to match detected peptides and almond linear epitopes recognized for the Homo sapiens host.</s><s>For this investigation, only peptides with sequence length &gt;9 AA were considered, in accordance with the EFSA guidelines set up to test the allergenicity of in vitro digested proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s>No intact epitopes reported in IEDB database were found to match with the peptides included in low MW protein fraction of digested almonds untreated and treated with the two different approaches.</s><s>In Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> of supplementary data, peptide sequences searched in IEDB database along with the belonging proteins were shown.</s><s>Despite arisen from allergenic proteins, no peptides were found to preserve an intact epitopic sequence.</s><s>Although results appeared be very promising, they need to be further confirmed by specific immunological analysis (e.g., immunoblotting with patients' sera allergic to almonds).</s><s>Indeed, this kind of approach substantially based on bioinformatics analysis could present limitations due to the restricted number of almond epitopes sequenced and deposited in IEDB database.</s><s>Anyway, our preliminary results are in line with those reported by Mandalari et al., 2014 on the residual immunoreactivity of natural almonds digested by a dynamic digestion protocol.</s><s>They found that dot blot signals produced by probing materials with rabbit pAb and two murine mABs (mAb 2A3 specific for a linear epitope of prunin and mAb 4C10 specific for a conformational almond epitope) were significantly decreased with respect to undigested sample, and this trend was confirmed by ELISA assay.</s><s>On the contrary, the same authors stated that when incorporated into processed food (Victoria sponge cake and chocolate mousse), the digestibility of almond proteins resulted slowed down by passing from gastric to duodenal compartments, with consequence persistence of some immunoreactivity at the end of digestion, mainly visible in chocolate mousse sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, the effect of autoclaving treatment on the residual immunological potential of almonds was never investigated before by tracking the fate of the allergenic protein upon simulated gastro-duodenal digestion, therefore our promising results could open the way for further analysis in this direction.</s><s>Moreover, considering the importance of the food matrix in the modulation of the digestibility, and consequently the allergenicity, of almond proteins, further studies aimed at investigating the immunoreactivity of thermally/pressure treated almonds-based composite food commodities should be very interesting from a toxicological point of view.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p><s>In this study, the combination of heat/pressure treatments (autoclave), performed at 134 • C, 2 atm, was investigated for its potential to reduce almond allergenicity.</s><s>Almond seeds were submitted to autoclave treatment, preceded or not by a hydration step, and the respective protein recovery was assessed by Bradford assay, along with the evaluation of their immunoreactivity by ELISA tests.</s><s>Finally, any change induced by autoclaving treatments on almond proteins digestibility was evaluated by in vitro digestion experiments, and the persistence of digestive immunoreactive peptides was assessed by bioinformatic analysis.</s><s>Our results showed that the synergist effect of heat and pressure resulted in a visible alteration of almond proteins stability, inducing a final reduction of the total immunoreactivity in almonds.</s><s>In particular, hydration before autoclaving proved to increase the efficacy of the thermal/pressure treatment, contributing to the disappearance of the main allergenic protein bands and altering significantly the final immunoreactivity.</s><s>Furthermore, by submitting the treated almonds to in vitro digestion experiments a full degradation of the main almond allergens took place and the residual immunoreactivity estimated by bioinformatics analysis turn out to be negligible.</s><s>This demonstrated that the autoclave-based treatment may induce a drastic reduction of the overall allergenicity in almonds, especially when preceded by incubation in water.</s><s>In perspective, this represents a first step towards the development of effective processing techniques to reduce tree nut immunoreactivity and may prove useful in the development of strategies for food tolerance induction and/or to establish threshold levels of sensitization/elicitation for hypoallergenic foods.</s><s>However, further investigations are required, mainly employing immunological techniques, to evaluate any loss of residual allergenicity of processed almonds on allergic patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Protein content estimated with Bradford protein assay corresponding to untreated almond (CTRL) and almond submitted to autoclaving for 10 min (AC10) and 20 min (AC20), prehydration/autoclaving for 10 min (H 2 O_AC10) and 20 min (H 2 O_AC20).</s><s>The results of a Tukey-Kramer test for multiple mean comparison are also reported and expressed using the following annotation a = CTRL and almonds autoclaved for 10 min (no statistically significant difference found); b = almonds autoclaved for 20 min; c = almonds hydrated and autoclaved for 10 and 20 min (no statistically significant difference found).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="7,191.08,511.36,213.12,143.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
