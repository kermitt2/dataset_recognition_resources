<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Dopamine (DA) is an important neurotransmitter in the brain's limbic reward system which plays a significant role in functioning of cardiovascular system, renal and transferring the information to different parts of brain mainly by the rewardmotivated pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>The abnormal levels of DA are shown to have a significant effect on neurological disorders that are linked to Parkinson's, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Hence, sensitive and selective determination of the DA level is extremely important for the early diagnosis and prevention of these diseases for the well-being of human health.</s><s>For a healthy individual, DA level lies in the range of 0.01−10 μM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Among various techniques used for the detection of DA, electrochemical methods are in vogue because of its quick response, high sensitivity and more importantly, easy electrooxidation of DA makes it more viable.</s><s>However, the coexistence of uric acid (UA) and a high concentration of ascorbic acid [AA 100−1000 times higher than DA] in the extracellular fluids of the central nervous system can cause great interference because of its oxidation potentials which are close to that of DA on bare electrodes resulting in poor selectivity.</s><s>Moreover, the electro-oxidation of DA in the presence of AA results in regeneration of DA by reducing back the oxidized DA by AA and then reoxidizing at the electrode surface making the system unreliable.</s></p><p><s>Hence, it is of great importance to develop a highly selective and sensitive probe capable enough to completely knock down the interference of AA and UA for an efficient and quick therapeutics.</s><s>Numerous efforts have been made in eliminating the interference of AA and the selective detection of DA.</s><s>For example, transition metal oxides, noble metals, 6−8 Ag−Pt/ carbon nanofibers, 9 boron-doped diamond electrode, 5 peptide nanostructures, 10 polymer, <ref type="bibr">11</ref> and functionalized carbonaceous nanomaterials <ref type="bibr">12</ref> have been explored.</s><s>Nevertheless, extremely low concentration of DA in the presence of high concentration of AA imposes severe limitations for the existing catalyst materials.</s></p><p><s>Polyoxometalates (POMs) are high-oxidation-state transition metaloxide clusters that have attracted a great attention in numerous applications toward material science, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> catalyst in homogeneous and heterogeneous system, 14−16 energy storage systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">17</ref> electrocatalysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">18</ref> and medicine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">19</ref></s><s>It is also used in electrochemical sensing because of its multielectron redox properties and high stability without altering the composition; furthermore, its physical properties can be fine-tuned by varying the cations.</s><s>A few reports of DA-sensing by POM are also reported, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">21</ref>  ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Physical Characterization.</s><s>In the present study, we have shown that PVIM−Co 5 POM conjugate is a stable catalyst to perform sensitive and selective detection of DA.</s><s>Our approach was to improve the conductivity and simultaneously enhanced electron transfer of novel Co 5 POM molecular catalyst for a selective electrochemical detection of DA using PVIM polymer matrix and NCNTs.</s></p><p><s>The sandwich Na 12 [Co 5 POM] was synthesized under microwave heating and the green-colored crystals was obtained from recrystallization under slow evaporation of the aqueous mixture (detailed in Experimental Section).</s><s>The molecular structure was analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> (Supporting Information, CCDC no.</s><s>1558372).</s><s>As revealed by the molecular structure, three Co atoms and one W atom formed a cubane which is sandwiched between two [CoW 9 O 34 ] Keggin fragments.</s><s>The molecular formula of the compound was found to be Na It can be seen from the images that Co 5 POM displays no distinguishable structural features and is basically nonconductive resulted in contrast difference because of the electrostatic charge accumulation on the surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6</ref>).</s><s>The optical images of Na 12 Co 5 POM and PVIM-Co 5 POM conjugate in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6c</ref> (Supporting Information) reveal the dark green crystals, which forms light green concrete solid after the exchange of cation with PVIM, in which PVIM acts as a binder.</s><s>The same aggregation of the PVIM−Co 5 POM conjugate can be seen in SEM images (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6</ref>, Supporting Information).</s><s>However, after the physical mixing of NCNTs with PVIM− Co 5 POM resulted in the formation of fairly homogeneous layer around the NCNTs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>) exhibits three main peaks, one at the lowest binding energy (398.5 eV) can be attributed to pyridinic nitrogen (N1), the peak at 399.5 eV originates from pyrrolic nitrogen (N2), and the higher binding energy peak at 400.4 eV assigned to quaternary group (N3) present in NCNTs and in    phosphate-buffered solution (PBS; pH 7.0) containing 500 μM AA and 50 μM DA at a scan rate of 75 mV s −1 .</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref> reveals the formation of redox peaks centered at 210 and 168 mV corresponding to oxidation of DA to dopaminoquinone and subsequent reduction to DA respectively.</s><s>However, no peaks with respect to oxidation of AA was observed in CV, and a feeble peak was observed for AA in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>) and the lower detection limit was found to be 10 μM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>).</s><s>Despite the selective behavior, PVIM−Co 5 POM conjugate suffers from a broadened electrochemical response for DA oxidation attributed to the sluggish electron-transfer kinetics.</s><s>Functionalized CNTs were incorporated to improve the electron-transfer process.</s><s>Depending upon the nature of the functionalities present within the CNTs, it is possible to mediate and tune the sensitivity toward DA determination and electron transfer across the interface.</s></p><p><s>The PVIM−Co 5 POM conjugate was taken in combination with various NCNTs (NCNT-200, NCNT-400, and NCNT-600, detailed in the Supporting Information) designated as PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT composite (synthesis detailed in Experimental Section) and performed the analysis under similar conditions.</s><s>As expected, both PVIM−Co 5 POM/ NCNT-400 and PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-200 shows wellbehaved redox behavior however, the higher redox current was observed for PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite, as shown in CV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>).</s><s>The differential activity towards electro-oxidation of DA could be because of the kinetics of the interfacial charge-transfer process, which in turn relates to the electron transfer at the electrode−electrolyte interface and was further studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</s></p><p><s>As evident from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>, the R ct (charge-transfer resistance) is lower for PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite compared to the other two catalysts.</s><s>The higher R ct at PVIM−Co 5 POM indicates dominance of sluggish kinetics because of the resistance at electrode−electrolyte interface.</s><s>This fortifies the fact that the PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite reveals faster kinetics towards electro-oxidation of DA because of the facilitated electron transport at the catalyst surface.</s></p><p><s>Further, the sensitivity of the PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite was carried out by varying the concentration of DA (500 pM to 600 μM) and keeping AA constant (500 μM).</s><s>Surprisingly, the PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c</ref> shows a noticeable peak at a very low concentration of DA (500 pM) and a sharp intense peak at 1 nM.</s><s>Subsequently, a sharp increase in the oxidation peak current was observed with increase in DA concentration (500 pM to 600 μM, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>) demonstrating the superior sensitivity towards the determination of DA.</s><s>This was further supported by EIS studies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, no oxidation peak corresponding to AA was observed even at this high AA concentration of 500 μM indicating that PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite inhibits the diffusion of AA toward the electrode surface through plausible repulsive electrostatic interaction between anionic AA and a negatively charged cluster of Co 5 POM (Scheme 1).</s><s>It is important to note that no significant peak corresponding to the oxidation of AA was observed even with increase in concentration of DA (600 μM, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>), demonstrating the complete elimination of AA interference.</s></p><p><s>Similar experiments using PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-200 (Figure <ref type="figure">S10</ref>, Supporting Information), PVIM−Co 5 POM/ NCNT-600 composite shows similar behavior but the peak current corresponding to oxidation of DA is lower in both of the cases compared to PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite.</s><s>It is noteworthy to mention that, the lowest detection limit was found to be 1 and 10 μM respectively with the linear detection range of 1−300 μM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S11a</ref>) in both of the cases, which is lower than PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite.</s><s>This was further evidenced by EIS studies (Figure <ref type="figure">S10b</ref>, Supporting Information) wherein R ct decreases with increasing concentration of DA (up to 300 μM) and with further increase in DA concentration, R ct increases (Figure <ref type="figure">S10C</ref>), and a shift in R s (solution resistance) was observed (the oxidation peak current in DPV decreases, figure not shown) indicating the slow kinetics because of the less electron transfer at the electrode−electrolyte interface.</s><s>Further control experiments using PVIM−Co 5 POM/oxidized CNT (OCNT)modified graphite electrode reveals a broadened electrochemical response toward oxidation of DA. Surprisingly, no peak corresponding to the oxidation of DA was observed up to 300 nM concentration of DA, however, a pronounced broadened peak at −30 mV attributed to oxidation of AA was observed.</s><s>Further increase in the concentration of DA, an additional peak appeared at 100 mV, and peak current increases with the subsequent increase in DA indicates the interference of AA (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6 and S11</ref>, Supporting Information).</s></p><p><s>The above results demonstrate the excellent sensitivity of PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite toward the electrochemical detection of DA with a lowest limit of 500 pM (0.0005 μM) and selectivity with the linear detection range of 0.0005−600 μM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>This is one of the best catalyst reported so far towards the selective electrochemical detection of DA (comparison tabulated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The selectivity of the proposed sensor was also assessed in the presence of UA nevertheless, neither significant peak corresponding to the oxidation of UA nor shift in the peak corresponding to the oxidation of DA was observed with a subsequent increase in the concentration of DA (200 μM, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S12</ref>), demonstrating the complete elimination of UA interference.</s></p><p><s>The plot of anodic and cathodic peak current with respect to square root of different scan rate reveals the linear response suggesting the electro-oxidation process of DA is the diffusioncontrolled reaction (Figures S13−S15, Supporting Information).</s><s>In an attempt to explore this sensor for practical applications, the PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite was analyzed for the detection of DA in real sample using commercially available DA hydrochloride injections (40 mg mL −1 ) by standard addition method, and the recovery of the sample was in the range of 95−102%, demonstrating the applicability of the PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite for real-time analysis as well.</s><s>Further, the stability of the PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in a solution containing 50 μM DA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S16</ref>, Supporting Information), which evidently demonstrates the negligible decay in either current or potential even after 100 consecutive cycles.</s></p><p><s>The enhanced selective electrochemical response obtained can be attributed to the specific electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged Co 5 POM and DA (positively charged) through effective stabilization at NCNTs surface.</s><s>Moreover, the synergistic effect arising from the strong π−π interaction between NCNTs and imidazolium cations of PVIM, along with the electrostatic interaction between PVIM and Co 5 POM, which further enhances the electrochemical response through accelerating the electron transfer from Co 5 POM to the electrode surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">18</ref></s><s>CONCLUSIONS Here, we demonstrated a novel sandwich POM [WCo 3 (H 2 O) 2 (CoW 9 O 34 ) 2 ] 12− and poly(ionic liquid) [PVIM + ] in combination with NCNTs as an electrochemical sensor for a highly selective and ultrasensitive detection of DA.</s><s>The novel PVIM−Co 5 POM/NCNT-400 composite demonstrates a superior selectivity and sensitivity evident from the DPV studies with a lowest detection limit of 500 pM (500 × 10 −12 M).</s><s>The linear detection range was found to be 500 pM to 600 μM, even in presence of higher concentration of AA (500 μM), demonstrating the complete elimination of AA and UA interference.</s><s>The ionic polymer acts as a bridge between Co 5 POM and NCNTs, which provides physical and chemical stability simultaneously to eliminate the interference of AA with increased sensitivity.</s><s>Employing the efficient heterogenization of Co 5 POM catalyst by PVIM over NCNTs provides the synergy between PVIM−POM catalyst and NCNTs, which enhances the electron transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface and eliminates the interference of AA and UA at physiological pH (7.4).</s></p></div>
