<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Roquin is an RBP with a central role in repressing autoimmunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Originally, a missense mutation in the Rc3h1 gene encoding the Roquin-1 protein was identified as the cause of systemic lupus erythematosus-like autoimmunity phenotype in sanroque mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Roquin-1 is localized in cytoplasmic granules <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and binds to the 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) of inducible costimulator (ICOS) mRNA to post-transcriptionally repress its expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, Roquin-1, as well as its paralogue Roquin-2, interacts with 3 0 UTR of TNFRSF4 and tumour-necrosis factor-a (TNFa), and modulates immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Recent studies showed that Roquin proteins interact through their ROQ domains with a constitutive decay element (CDE) in the 3 0 UTR of TNFa mRNA and promotes the decay of this transcript by recruiting the CCR4-CAF1-NOT deadenylase complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>The CDE of TNFa folds into a characteristic stem-loop structure containing a specific trinucleotide loop, which is highly similar to the Roquin-1 RNA recognition element in the ICOS 3 0 UTR (ref.</s><s>9).</s><s>Latest structural analyses showed the ROQ domain in complex with a prototypical CDE RNA stem-loop revealing recognition of the RNA stem and its trinucleotide loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Leppek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> further identified additional Rc3h1 target transcripts by RNAimmunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) analysis, including regulators of the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway.</s><s>However, a recognizable CDE was absent in the majority of Rc3h1-bound mRNAs, suggesting other modes of RNA recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>In line with these findings, Schlundt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> showed by mutational and structural analyses of RNA ligands that relaxed CDE consensus sequences can mediate Roquin-dependent regulation.</s><s>Similarly, Tan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and Schuetz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> reported that the ROQ domain of Rc3h1 recognizes the CDE and can also bind to duplex RNA.</s><s>In addition to the ROQ domain, RC3H1 possesses an N-terminal RING finger with a potential E3 ubiquitin-ligase function <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , as well as a CCCH-type zinc (Zn) finger that is involved in RNA recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>CCCH-type Zn-finger RBPs typically contact AUrich elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>AU-rich elements are conserved cis-regulatory elements, originally discovered in the 3 0 UTRs of

a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human RC3H1 RNA recognition and disentangle its cellular function, we applied PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable ribonucleosideenhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> to identify RC3H1 RNA-binding sites and target transcripts in HEK293 cells.</s><s>RC3H1 contacts mRNAs through structure-sequence elements located in 3 0 UTRs.</s><s>The binding sites are composed of hairpins with variable loop length often with embedded U-rich sequences, including CDE consensus sequences.</s><s>RC3H1-bound mRNA targets are short-lived, and RC3H1 depletion results in decreased mRNA decay rates and increased protein synthesis of its target mRNAs.</s><s>RC3H1 target transcripts are enriched for mRNAs that are induced upon DNA damage, among them are the mRNA of A20 (also known as TNFAIP3).</s><s>A20 codes for an ubiquitin-editing enzyme, which inhibits activation of NF-kB <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that RC3H1 interacts with a non-CDE-type stem-loop structure preceded by an AU-rich sequence in the A20 3 0 UTR involving ROQ and CCCH-type Zn-finger domains, indicating a yet unrecognized RC3H1-binding mode and specificity.</s><s>Depletion of RC3H1 leads to increased A20 protein

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Human RC3H1 binds to thousands of mRNAs.</s><s>To identify RC3H1-binding sites at high resolution, we applied PAR-CLIP in combination with next-generation sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>In PAR-CLIP experiments, nascent RNA is metabolically labelled with the nonperturbing photoreactive ribonucleosides 4-thiouridine (4SU) or 6-thioguanosine (6SG).</s><s>Crosslinking of protein to 4SU-or 6SGlabelled RNA leads to specific T to C or G to A transitions, respectively, that occur at high frequency in complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence reads and mark the protein crosslinking sites on the target RNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>HEK293 cells stably expressing inducible FLAG/HA-tagged RC3H1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) were crosslinked after labelling of RNA with either 4SU or 6SG.</s><s>Immunopurified, ribonuclease-treated and radiolabelled RC3H1-RNA complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Protein-protected RNA fragments were recovered and converted into a cDNA library amenable to Illumina sequencing.</s></p><p><s>In total, we performed three independent PAR-CLIP experiments (two biological replicates with 4SU, 4SU-1 and 4SU-2, and one replicate with 6SG; see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Sequence reads were mapped to the human genome and overlapping reads were used to build RC3H1-binding clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>In PAR-CLIP experiments using 4SU, diagnostic T to C transitions detected in mapped reads were most highly abundant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, but less pronounced, the diagnostic G to A changes were the most abundant type of mutation for the 6SG PAR-CLIP experiment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>A length histogram of RC3H1 PAR-CLIP clusters shows a median cluster size of B25-30 nucleotides (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We identified B2,000-4,000 RC3H1 mRNA target transcripts in each of the 4SU PAR-CLIP experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Ninety-three per cent of the 481 6SG PAR-CLIP mRNA targets were reproduced in 4SU libraries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>We combined the 'reads' from all PAR-CLIP experiments to derive a set of consensus binding sites supported by reads from at least two out of three experiments (see Methods section).</s><s>Based on this analysis, we identified 16,234 RC3H1-binding sites on 3,821 protein-coding transcripts as consensus data set (Supplementary Data 1).</s><s>The binding sites and PAR-CLIP sequence alignments are publicly available at http://bimsbstatic.mdc-berlin.de/landthaler/RC3H1.</s><s>The position with the highest number of PAR-CLIP-derived diagnostic nucleotide transitions for each binding sites was referred to as the preferred crosslinking site.</s></p><p><s>To gain an insight into the transcripts regulated by RC3H1, genes encoding RC3H1-bound mRNAs were subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, cell cycle and p53 signalling pathway were overrepresented in the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>), suggesting that RC3H1 could play a role in the response to DNA damage.</s><s>Furthermore, GO term enrichment analysis showed that RC3H1-bound transcripts are highly enriched for regulators of gene expression such as transcription factors, RBPs and ubiquitin ligases (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>In addition, when comparing the human RC3H1 targets with mouse Roquin-bound transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , we identified 36 out of 55 Roquin-interacting mRNAs by PAR-CLIP in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>RC3H1-binding sites are mostly located in 3 0 UTR of mRNAs.</s><s>Next, we examined the distribution of RC3H1-binding sites along mRNA transcripts.</s><s>The majority of binding sites (81%) were found to be located in 3 0 UTRs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>), consistent with previous observations that RC3H1 binds to ICOS and TNFa mRNAs through 3 0 UTR interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>RC3H1 binding to ICOS and TNFa mRNAs in HEK293 cells was not observed likely due to undetectable ICOS and TNFa mRNA expression.</s><s>A preference for RC3H1 binding along 3 0 UTRs of target transcripts was not apparent, since binding clusters were almost equally distributed over this transcript region (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</s><s>Since a previous study suggested a functional link between RC3H1 binding and microRNA (miRNA) activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , we examined the local interactions between RC3H1 and miRNA by computing the density of conserved miRNA target sites around RC3H1 preferred crosslinking sites (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>).</s><s>The observed profile indicated an overrepresentation of miRNA seed complements in the vicinity of RC3H1-binding sites, but did not directly overlap with these sites.</s></p><p><s>U-rich hairpins dominate as recognition features.</s><s>To investigate RNA features recognized by RC3H1, we searched for sequence and secondary structure elements in RC3H1-binding sites.</s><s>First, we examined 7mer occurrences in 41 nucleotide windows centred on preferred crosslinking sites in RC3H1-binding sites.</s><s>Notably, U-rich sequences were frequently found in RC3H1-binding sites derived from both 4SU and 6SG experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), suggesting that the frequent observation of U-richness is not owing to a bias introduced by using 4SU.</s><s>These U-rich 7mers were overrepresented in RC3H1-binding sites when compared with control 7mers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, U-rich elements were not enriched in IGF2BP1-binding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , whereas 7mer containing the CAU consensus sequence are overrepresented (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>U-rich sequences with interspersed adenosines were more enriched in RC3H1 consensus binding sites in 3 0 UTR sequences when compared with U-rich 7mer sequences containing guanosines (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and Supplementary Data 2).</s><s>Similar results were also obtained from 5mer analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, U-rich sequences were found in close proximity of preferred crosslink sites, suggesting the direct interaction of RC3H1 with these sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we examined the occurrence of the previously identified CDE motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , and found that the core CDE consensus sequence (UCYRYGA) was present in RC3H1-binding sites, but the frequency was less prominent than that of several U-rich sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To examine potential secondary structure features in RC3H1binding sites, we
