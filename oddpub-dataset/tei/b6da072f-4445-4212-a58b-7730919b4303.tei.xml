in-vivo brain imaging technologies, volumetric quantification of brain structures from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is more accessible than ever.</s><s>Thus, large-scale studies often acquire MRI to investigate relations between volume of specific brain structures and different aspects of behavior.</s></p><p><s>Due to their involvement in multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, the medial temporal lobe structures hippocampus and amygdala have received a considerable amount of attention.</s><s>The hippocampus is one of the most commonly studied and cited brain structures in the scientific literature.</s><s>Its involvement in basic cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Squire, 1992)</ref>, psychopathologies such as

target="#b56">(Stein et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The association between negative life events during childhood, such as abuse and traumatic experiences, and the increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders later in life is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Janssen et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">MacMillan

et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Woon and Hedges, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, many efforts are directed at defining and clarifying the roles of the amygdala and the hippocampus in pediatric samples.</s><s>From a structural neuroimaging perspective, an important challenge lies in the reliable and valid volumetric quantification of these brain regions.</s><s>However, reliable volumetric estimation is methodologically limited by the anatomical complexity of these two structures.</s></p><p><s>Manual segmentation is currently considered the gold standard for volumetric quantification of brain structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pardoe et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rodionov et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, this procedure requires sufficient anatomical and MR methodological expertise, is difficult and timeconsuming to learn, and can be associated with intra-and inter-rater variability if not performed using a consistent approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jack Jr. et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>In order to increase reliability and reduce potential biases associated with manual segmentation procedures, multiple protocols have been established and described in the literature for specific target regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jack et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Matsuoka et al.,

time demands of manual segmentation procedures.</s><s>In contrast, protocols that offer the fully automated processing and segmentation of target structures from MR images are fast (speed is only limited by CPU power and availability), have excellent reproducibility and require little anatomical expertise from the end user.</s><s>As a result, a number of automated protocols have recently been developed, published and received favorably by the research community.</s><s>In part because they are easily and freely accessible to the research community and provide detailed documentation on usage, two of these automated procedures have gained a considerable amount of popularity.</s><s>The first one is FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.</s><s>edu), a software developed by the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fischl et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>FreeSurfer automatically assigns a label to each voxel from the anatomical image based on probabilistic estimations relying on Markov random fields (MRFs).</s><s>The localisation and spatial relations between structures are defined according using a training set of manually labeled brains.</s><s>The second commonly used automated segmentation protocol is "FIRST", provided as part of the FSL software library (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Patenaude, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patenaude et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Using a probabilistic framework, this software estimates boundaries of brain structures based on the signal intensity of the T1 image as well as the expected shape of structures to be segmented.</s></p><p><s>It is well known that neuroanatomical variations are found not only in clinical populations, but also when comparing brains of normal individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pruessner et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Automated segmentation approaches are based on the questionable assumption that computer algorithms can reliably differentiate and delimitate anatomical regions regardless of inter-individual differences in neuroanatomy, scan quality, image contrast, etc.</s><s>While we did not find any studies comparing the performance of automated segmentation performed with FSL-FIRST and/or FreeSurfer to manual segmentation in pediatric populations, the validity of these protocols has previously been assessed in healthy adult controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cherbuin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Morey et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Patenaude et

study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Morey et al. (2009)</ref> revealed weaker associations between manual segmentation and both FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer when estimating the amygdala volume than when estimating the hippocampus volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Morey et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these results seem to indicate that the concordance between volumes derived from manual segmentation versus automatic protocols depend on the segmented structure as well as the protocol used.</s><s>Further, a report by Sánchez-Benavides suggests that the accuracy of automated protocols may vary depending on neuroanatomical characteristics of studied populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sánchez-Benavides et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>More precisely, this later study highlights a larger discrepancy between manually and automatically segmented volumes when used on atrophic brains.</s><s>Previous reports assessing the validity and accuracy of FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer were based on adult brains; it remains uncertain whether smaller brain volumes and potential changes in gray / white matter contrasts in pediatric brains negatively affect the performance of these two automated segmentation software.</s><s>Thus, studies investigating the validity of automated segmentation in children are needed.</s></p><p><s>The goal of this article was to explore the validity of FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer in estimating hippocampus and amygdala volumes in children.</s><s>To do so, we compared volumes generated by these two automated techniques to volumes obtained by manual segmentation, which is considered to be the "gold standard" approach.</s><s>The validity of the segmentation methods was investigated by means of three different approaches.</s><s>First, we established discrepancies between volumes derived from manual segmentation and automated methods.</s><s>Second, to estimate the consistency between manual and automated segmentation, we assessed between-and within-method associations of hippocampus and amygdala volumes.</s><s>Finally, to explore agreement between volumes and estimate possible proportional and fixed biases in volume estimation we computed Bland-Altman plots.</s></p></div>

The protocol used for the manual segmentations in this article systematically excludes the Andreas-Retzius and the Fasciolar gyrus from the tail of the hippocampus.</s><s>Also, this protocol takes extra care to avoid including the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, even in subjects where it might not be clearly apparent, by excluding voxels in the infero-lateral portion of the hippocampus with ambiguous signal intensity.</s><s>This exclusion takes place even if in one slice these voxels appear as gray matter, but the existence of the inferior horn can be extrapolated from neighboring slices.</s><s>Such an approach is likely not present in automatic segmentation methods for hippocampal volumes, and thus can be expected to result in somewhat larger volume estimates.</s><s>However, the amount of volume that would be generated by the inclusion of the Andreas-Retzius gyrus and the lateral ventricle can be estimated not to be more than 5% additional volume, which is far inferior to the volume differences observed between the automated methods and the manual one in the current study.</s><s>In addition, other anatomical boundaries present in the manual method protocol appear to match well with those of the automated ones.</s><s>These areas include the superiolateral white matter bands of the hippocampus, the fornix and more anterior, the fimbria and the alveus.</s><s>Also, both the manual and the automated segmentation method include at least part of the subiculum.</s><s>Thus, differences anatomical boundaries between segmentation protocols could be expected to result in volume changes of around 5%, with the automated methods generating larger volumes than the manual one.</s><s>This is clearly not what is seen, as the automated methods generate hippocampus volumes that are approximately 28% (FSL) and 55% (Freesurfer) larger than the manual ones.</s><s>This additional overestimation could be the consequence of using a standard brain template derived from mature adult brains compared to a pediatric population.</s><s>Future studies should determine whether using a common space based on pediatric brains, which would be more representative of this population's neuroanatomy, could potentially improve the accuracy of automated segmentation techniques.</s><s>Another possible cause for this additional discrepancy can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, which illustrates for selected subjects that both automated methods suffer from inclusion of ventricle space, neighboring gray matter structures, and white matter in their segmentations.</s><s>There are probably multiple reasons for the inclusion of these structures and areas not part of the target structure.</s><s>Signal intensity might vary depending on scan quality and motion artifacts, which may lead to a less precise differentiation and classification of structures by automated techniques.</s><s>This might be especially significant in children, who are more likely to move during scan acquisition.</s><s>Although, we performed a visual quality control to remove scans with apparent motion artifacts, it cannot be excluded that motion affected the quality of the results from the two automatic segmentation protocols.</s><s>Further, even in scans of high quality, superior and lateral boundaries of the amygdala with the basal ganglia, inferior boundaries with the hippocampus and lateral-inferior boundaries with the entorhinal cortex can be difficult to define based on signal intensity, and are highly variable across subjects due to anatomical heterogeneity.</s><s>Consequently, manual segmentation protocols often rely on the visualization of the area by a trained anatomist, recognition of the various structures in the field of view, and an expert decision as to where exactly the boundary to surrounding structures is located for that particular subject.</s><s>This is a procedure that is time and labor intensive but favors anatomical precision and validity.</s><s>Automated methods, in comparison, can't rely on an expert rater's decision in ambiguous circumstances, and have to employ probabilities and intensity distributions instead.</s><s>Future studies investigating differences in the 3-D shape of the hippocampus and amygdala segmented manually or with automated techniques could allow a better understanding of the discrepancy in volume observed when comparing manual and automatic segmentation.</s></p><p><s>Volume overestimation does not necessarily imply a lack of validity of automatic segmentation as long as it is done in a consistent manner.</s><s>Thus, to assess consistency in volume estimation, we computed pearson correlations between volumes derived from automatic methods and manual

commonly used to establish the validity of automated techniques is to define their accuracy in distinguishing individuals from different clinical groups (eg.</s><s>Alzheimer Disease versus Normal aging patients).</s><s>A limitation associated with this study lies in the absence subgroups in the studied population.</s><s>However, to arrive at an assessment of consistency for each method independently, we used between hemisphere correlations to demonstrate the differences between methods.</s><s>If manual and automated segmentations were interchangeable, it would be expected that the associations between left and right volumes would be similar regardless of the difference in structural definition associated with the segmentation protocol.</s><s>Further, it can be expected that, within the individual subject, left versus right hemispheric volumes are moderately to strongly associated <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allen et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Both manual segmentation and FreeSurfer seemed to support this last statement, with results showing strong correlations between left versus right hemisphere for both the amygdala and the hippocampus.</s><s>Correlations between bilateral amygdala and hippocampus volumes were significantly weaker when estimated with FSL-FIRST.</s><s>Thus, within-method correlations suggest that the FSL-FIRST method might be prone to inconsistencies in segmentation within the same subject.</s><s>The scope of this study was to investigate two key structures of the medial temporal lobe, the hippocampus and amygdala.</s><s>While results highlighted in this article are likely to extend to adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe, and perhaps to the rest of the cortex, our findings remain specific to those two key structures.</s><s>Future studies investigating the agreement between manual and automated segmentation using a more global approach and looking as spatial relationships between segmented structures would provide important additional information.</s></p><p><s>When looking at associations between manual segmentation and both automated techniques and the overall fit to the regression line, a considerable number of outliers could be visually identified.</s><s>In these outliers, a marked discrepancy between automatic and manual segmentation volume estimates is observed -contributing to a limited explanation of variance.</s><s>It is thus possible that the automated segmentation tends to be particularly inaccurate for some subjects.</s><s>The Bland-Altman diagrams seem to support that notion by indicating a trend for larger volume difference between manual and automated segmentation for individuals with smaller structure volumes.</s><s>Variations in scan quality or even in anatomy could contribute to this variability in performance.</s><s>The hippocampus shape and volume are known to be highly variable across normal subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bouix et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lupien et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Studies looking at hippocampal shape in pediatric populations highlighted variations in the hippocampal shape over the course of normal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gogtay et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lin et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gogtay et al. (2006)</ref> reveal important between-subject heterogeneity in the development of the hippocampal structure during brain development.</s><s>Automated techniques are likely to be less flexible and accurate when dealing with irregular shape.</s><s>On the other hand, an expert in neuroanatomy and hippocampus segmentation should not be affected by variance in shape.</s><s>Future studies should aim to investigate the impact associated with variations in the shape of neuroanatomical structures in the context of automatic segmentation validation.</s><s>To illustrate cases were there is an important discrepancy between automated and manual segmentation, we selected subjects that deviated from the regression line and visually compared labels obtained with both techniques.</s><s>In addition to corroborating the overestimation reported in previous analyses, these images show a tendency for automated methods to miss the borders of target structures and expand into adjacent areas, including ventricular space.</s><s>For those subjects, the obtained volume is not anatomically valid and should not be used in subsequent analyses.</s><s>This highlights the importance of quality control and, when needed, corrections of labels obtained automatically.</s><s>This process is time and labor intensive and is rarely performed thoroughly.</s><s>Both FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST include documentation and guidelines on quality control.</s><s>However, to reflect the way groups lacking the training and expertise in anatomy would use these tools, we did not apply any form of correction of the labels derived from automated methods in the current article.</s><s>A careful and informed quality control and manual corrections of automatically obtained labels by a trained individual would likely lead to significantly improved associations between manual segmentation and automatic techniques, especially when used in special populations like the one used in the current study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In this study we highlight differences in volumes of structures segmented manually or obtained with automatic techniques, in this case FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST.</s><s>We provide evidence that, in a pediatric population, volumes obtained with those techniques might not always be equivalent to volumes obtained when manually segmented by an anatomical expert.</s><s>This is especially true for more complex structures, such as the amygdala.</s><s>Our results also support a better consistency between manual segmentation and FreeSurfer than FSL-FIRST.</s><s>With these results, we hope to emphasize the importance of performing quality control on volumes obtained automatically.</s><s>A validated and well-established quality control protocol could significantly improve the correspondence between automatic and manual segmentation volumes.</s><s>Percentage of volume difference (% volume diff.),</s><s>Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) computed between manual segmentation volumes and automatic protocols.</s><s>Results are presented with native manual segmentation volumes obtained by resampling labels in the native space using an inversion of the linear transformation (left column) and with manual volumes obtained by dividing volumes segmented in the standard space by scale factors associated with the linear transformation in the x,y,z directions (right column).</s><s>This table shows that both methods of estimating manual segmentation volumes in the native space lead to highly similar results.</s><s>Lleft.</s><s>Rright.</s><s>SD-standard deviation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 2.
