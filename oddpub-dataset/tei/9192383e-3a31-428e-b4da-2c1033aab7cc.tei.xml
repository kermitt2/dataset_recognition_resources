<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Twenty right-handed, paid volunteers participated in the study.</s><s>Four participants had to be excluded due to extensive muscle or sweat artifacts in the EEG data.</s><s>The remaining 16 participants (9 female, 23.2 years mean age) had normal or corrected to normal vision and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric illness.</s><s>The study was conducted in accordance with the local Ethics Committee of the Charit e-Universit€ atsmedizin Berlin as well as with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provided written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup and Procedure</head><p><s>Participants were seated in a dimly lit, electrically and acoustically shielded chamber, while being presented with visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Prior to the main experiment, participants were presented with a passive localizer task (see below) and then performed two training blocks to familiarize themselves with the experimental paradigm.</s><s>They were also informed that the stimuli were sometimes presented in a temporally regular and sometimes in an irregular fashion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This was done to ensure that all participants were aware of the possible regularity in the stimulus train.</s><s>The experiment comprised of a two-by-two factorial design, with the factors inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) (regular or irregular) and Attention (attend-visual or attend-tactile) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>At the beginning of each trial, an auditory cue was presented that indicated to which sensory modality participants should attend (attend-visual or attend-tactile).</s><s>The auditory cue, which was delivered via in-ear air-pressure headphones (E-A-R tone Gold, Auditory Systems, Indianapolis), comprised of a sinusoidal 440 or 880 Hz tone with duration of 150 ms (including 5 ms rise and fall time).</s><s>The mapping between the cue tone frequency and the attentional condition was counterbalanced across participants (e.g., in half of the subjects the 440 Hz tone instructed participants to attend to the visual modality).</s><s>The cue was followed by an ISI, which blockwise had either a fixed (1,700 ms) or variable (1,000-2,400 ms, mean 1,700 ms) duration.</s><s>Participants benefited from temporal orienting of attention especially when stimuli were presented with fixed ISIs.</s><s>Following the ISI, a combined visuo-tactile stimulus was presented.</s><s>Irrespective of the experimental condition, this stimulus randomly contained either a visual target (25% of all trials), a tactile target (25%), or no target (50%; i.e., a standard; see below).</s><s>The participants' task was to perform a speeded button press with the right index finger when a target was presented in the cued modality (e.g., they had to press the button to visual targets when attention was cued to the visual modality).</s><s>No response was required for standards or for targets in the noncued modality.</s><s>Overall, participants were required to press a button on 25% of all trials.</s><s>Following the stimulus, the cue of the next trial was presented either at a fixed interval of 1,700 ms in the blocks with regular ISI or at a variable interval of 1,000-2,400 ms (mean 1,700 ms) in blocks with irregular ISI.</s><s>The main experiment comprised of 16 blocks lasting about 4 min each.</s><s>In half of the blocks, stimuli were presented with fixed ISIs and in the other half with variable ISIs.</s><s>Blocks with regular versus irregular ISIs alternated after every second block.</s><s>Each block consisted of 80 trials, half of which contained an attend-visual cue and the other half an attend-tactile cue (presented in random order).</s><s>In total, 320 trials were presented for each of the four experimental conditions.</s><s>Participants received visual feedback about the number of hits and misses, as well as on their mean RTs after each block.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visuo-Tactile Stimuli</head><p><s>All combined visuo-tactile stimuli were presented for 150 ms.</s><s>Visual inputs were presented on a tilted thin-film transistor (TFT) monitor at 40 cm distance from the eyes with a monochromatic neutral gray background (mean luminance of 30 cd/m 2 ).</s><s>Throughout experimental blocks, participants were instructed to focus on a central black fixation cross on the screen.</s><s>In trials with standards and tactile targets, the visual input comprised of a centrally presented black and white Gabor patch with vertical gratings (diameter: 5.758, spatial frequency 5 1 cycle per degree, Gaussian standard deviation 5 28).</s><s>In trials with visual targets, the same Gabor patch was presented but it flickered at a frequency of 16.7 Hz.</s><s>Tactile inputs were delivered to the index finger of the left hand by a 16-dot piezoelectric Braille display (4 3 4 quadratic matrix, 2.5 mm spacing; QuaeroSys, St. Johann, Germany).</s><s>The Braille display was attached centrally to the backside of the TFT monitor so that it matched with the location of the visual inputs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In trials with standards and visual targets, the tactile input comprised of a single elevation that lasted for 150 ms.</s><s>In trials featuring tactile targets, all pins elevated and contracted at a frequency of 16.7 Hz.</s><s>To mask the clicking noise by the Braille display during tactile stimulation, auditory white noise (150 ms duration) was presented via in-ear air-pressure headphones simultaneously with each visuo-tactile stimulus.</s><s>Participants consistently reported that they were unable to hear the noise of the Braille display during stimulation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Localizer Task</head><p><s>The reason for obtaining EEG data from a localizer task was to select regions of interest (ROIs) in sensory cortices for the analysis of neural oscillations in the main experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The localizer task consisted of 120 unisensory visual and 120 unisensory tactile stimuli, which were presented blockwise at ISIs of 1,300 ms.</s><s>Visual stimuli were identical to the visual components of the standards in the main experiment.</s><s>Tactile stimuli were identical to the tactile components of the standards.</s><s>To mask the noise by the Braille display, continuous white noise was presented via a battery-driven speaker throughout the entire localizer task.</s><s>The source-localized EEG responses to tactile stimuli showed no signs of auditory responses, suggesting that the masking was successful.</s><s>Participants were instructed to attend to the stimuli and to focus at a central fixation cross, but they did not perform a task.</s><s>The use of a localizer task for the ROI selection had two major advantages: first, it allowed for ROI selection independent of the experimental manipulations in the main study.</s><s>Second, stimuli in the main experiment comprised of simultaneously presented visual and tactile components, which hinders the source localization of the separate components.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Oscillatory Responses</head><p><s>For the analysis of oscillatory responses in the main experiment, we selected ROIs based on the findings from the localizer task.</s><s>To this end, evoked responses from the unisensory-visual and unisensory-tactile stimuli of the localizer task were projected into source space using a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[Van Veen et al., 1997]</ref>.</s><s>This was done for a poststimulus interval between 100 and 300 ms, with a 2300 to 2100 ms baseline.</s><s>To compensate for potential rank reduction during preprocessing, the lambda regularizationparameter was set to 5%.</s><s>Using these parameters, responses to unisensory-visual and unisensory-tactile stimuli were localized to the visual cortex and to the right somatosensory hand area, respectively, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Based on these activations, matching ROIs in the visual and right somatosensory hand areas were selected from the BrainMap atlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Fox et al., 1994]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, a third ROI comprising the left motor cortex (i.e., contralateral to the response hand) was selected [standard "motor area" from the BrainMap atlas;
