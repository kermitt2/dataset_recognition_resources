<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study has two main findings: First, the concept of enhancing tumour burden is a highly predictive prognostic factor for patient survival, which methodologically outperformed the commonly used 1D measurements.</s><s>Second, 3D quantitative evaluation of the dominant liver tumour lesion reliably predicts survival in patients with multifocal HCC who will undergo chemoembolization, thus rendering multi-tumour assessment clinically dispensable.</s></p><p><s>The results of our study confirm three hypotheses: First, a high volume of viable tumour as represented by enhancing tissue has a negative impact on survival.</s><s>In addition, the concept of enhancing tumour burden, which puts viable tumour volume in proportion to liver volume, is capable of reflecting the true and individual extent of the disease.</s><s>Lastly, patient survival is highly dependent on the extent of the dominant liver lesion.</s><s>Overall, the role of radiological assessment of HCC for diagnosis and staging cannot be overestimated and radiologically determined factors, such as size and number of tumour lesions, are central components prior to initial therapeutic assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>With regard to the BCLC staging system, many patients are situated on the edge between early and intermediate stages and one must therefore rely on imaging findings for treatment decisions between curative or palliative treatment options.</s><s>Several new staging systems are currently being developed with the goal of addressing this practical issue in a more reliable way.</s><s>On the one hand, an ideal HCC staging system should include state-of-the-art image assessment techniques in order to offer a more explicit and clear decision between curative and palliative therapy algorithms.</s><s>On the other hand, the application of any additional image analysis instrument should be workflow-efficient and compatible with clinical routine of diagnostic radiology.</s><s>The 3D quantitative evaluation of the dominant HCC lesion as described and validated in our work may do just that by fulfilling both aforementioned requirements.</s></p><p><s>The herein presented results demonstrate a statistically significant separation of survival curves for both diameter and volumetric measurements on baseline MRI.</s><s>With regard to the diameter-based measurements, these results are consistent with existing data from other centres that showed the rationale behind diameter-based tumour evaluation in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>However, our data shows that stratification based on volumetric thresholds and especially ETB [%] is superior to any other tested radiologic method in terms of separation of survival curves, concordances and hazard ratios.</s><s>An implication of this result is that diameter-based methods classified more patients with a high tumour burden as compared to the 3D quantitative techniques, thus suggesting a palliative approach for a comparably larger part of the patient cohort.</s><s>This finding might be of particular clinical interest beyond interventional oncology and confirms the recent trend towards a wider indication for liver transplantation, as suggested by the recently introduced HKLC staging system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>It can thus be assumed that the commonly used imaging cut-offs as propagated within the BCLC staging systems may very well lead to a detriment for patients with HCC through an overestimation of the stage of their disease.</s><s>This assumption is supported by data from other studies that evaluated diameter-based measurements in large tumour patient cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Volumetric tumour assessment is based on fairly new and clinically underrepresented technologies.</s><s>A variety of fundamentally different approaches have been recently tested in order to shape the growing role of volumetric image analysis for specific clinical settings.</s><s>One such study assessed the predictive value of volumetrically measured tumour burden for HCC recurrence after liver transplantation.</s><s>Based on the assumption that HCC lesions are ellipsoid rather than spherical, this retrospective study calculated tumour burden on the basis of the overall tumour diameter by extrapolating the volumes using the ellipsoid formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>However, this approach is limited because it neglects pathological heterogeneity in tumour shape and structure.</s></p><p><s>Another recently published study acknowledged the role of tumour biology for the assessment of tumour burden and expanded tumour assessment beyond diameter-based tumour size in the setting of intra-arterial therapies.</s><s>The authors applied a volumetric assessment of tumour burden using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping and concluded that changes in post embolization ADC values reflect patients' tumour burden reliably <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>However, a fundamental weakness of this study is the absence of conventional, diameter-based measurements as a reference.</s><s>Moreover, the authors did not explore clinically applicable cut-offs and applied a segmentation technique that lacks radiologicalpathological validation while using a less reliable, fully-automated algorithm.</s></p><p><s>Our previously published attempts to validate the use of 3D quantitative imaging for HCC staging identified the 65 cm 3 threshold as a reliable cut-off value to stratify patient survival according to the enhancing tumour volume of the dominant HCC lesion.</s><s>However, this study did not explore the emerging role of the liver volume and focused on the single dominant index lesion.</s><s>The current study addresses both issues by showing that 3D assessment of all tumour lesions achieves the most predictive value.</s><s>However, the difference in concordances between assessing the dominant lesion only vs. assessing multiple lesions remained below statistical significance and might be clinically dispensable.</s><s>This result has a broad relevance and may increase the clinical practicability of a 3D tumour assessment.</s><s>The herein described methodology introduced staggered thresholds, thus allowing for the prediction of survival in patients with smaller tumours.</s><s>Moreover, the holistic concept of enhancing tumour burden that includes liver volume proved to be a superior model for the prediction of OS when compared to any other assessed radiological method.</s></p><p><s>There were several limitations to our study.</s><s>First, it is a single-institutional retrospective analysis in patients with HCC treated with chemoembolization only.</s><s>This may have caused selection bias and furthermore limits the applicability of the data with regard to early-stage disease.</s><s>However, because TACE is the most commonly used treatment for unresectable HCC, our study may provide a more standardized approach for an interventional oncology setting.</s><s>The choice of thresholds in this study is an additional limitation.</s><s>An ideal staging system would separate very small single tumours of less than 2 cm in order to stratify patients into very early tumour stage as a separate group <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Because of the medium-sized cohort with mainly intermediate and advanced stages and tumour sizes, our study lacks this step and thus does not offer a sufficient subgroup analysis.</s><s>The recruitment of patients with advanced-stage HCC (BCLC C) for loco-regional therapies and subsequent image analysis is in agreement with the clinical reality, which frequently deviates from the BCLC treatment recommendations.</s><s>In light of the recently introduced HKLC staging system which propagates intra-arterial therapies in patients with greater tumour burden (mostly BCLC C), the herein proposed 3D imaging markers can be used across tumour stage and were thus validated for both BCLC B and C patients.</s></p><p><s>In summary, 3D quantitative assessment of the enhancing tumour burden as represented by the largest HCC lesion is a stronger predictor of survival as compared to diameter-based measurements.</s><s>Assessing multiple tumour lesions provides no substantial improvement in predicting OS than evaluating the dominant lesion alone.</s><s>Exclusion criteria flowchart.</s><s>A total of 142 patients were excluded because of portal vein invasion; 28 patients were excluded because of missing or inadequate MRI results.</s><s>In addition, a total of 8 patients were excluded because of infiltrative HCC  Definition of thresholds.</s><s>Cut-offs derive from unidimensional values that were extrapolated using the equation for the calculation of spheroid volumes (see figure).</s><s>For single lesions, this was 5 cm for diameter and 65 cm 3 for volumes.</s><s>For multiple lesions, this was 3 lesions each 3 cm in diameter and for volumes 45 cm 3 Boxplots
