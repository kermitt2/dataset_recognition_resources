<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Neurotransmission involves the calcium-regulated exocytic fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and the subsequent retrieval of SV membranes followed by reformation of properly sized and shaped SVs.</s><s>An unresolved question is whether each SV protein is sorted by its own dedicated adaptor or whether sorting is facilitated by association between different SV proteins.</s><s>We demonstrate that endocytic sorting of the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is mediated by the overlapping activities of the Syt1-associated SV glycoprotein SV2A/B and the endocytic Syt1-adaptor stonin 2 (Stn2).</s><s>Deletion or knockdown of either SV2A/B or Stn2 results in partial Syt1 loss and missorting of Syt1 to the neuronal surface, whereas deletion of both SV2A/B and Stn2 dramatically exacerbates this phenotype.</s><s>Selective missorting and degradation of Syt1 in the absence of SV2A/B and Stn2 impairs the efficacy of neurotransmission at hippocampal synapses.</s><s>These results indicate that endocytic sorting of Syt1 to SVs is mediated by the overlapping activities of SV2A/B and Stn2 and favor a model according to which SV protein sorting is guarded by both cargo-specific mechanisms as well as association between SV proteins.</s><s>neurotransmission | synaptic vesicle protein sorting | calcium sensor | endocytosis | knockout mice N eurotransmission is based on the calcium-triggered fusion of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SVs) with the presynaptic plasma membrane.</s><s>To sustain neurotransmitter release, neurons have evolved mechanisms to retrieve SV membranes and to reform SVs locally within presynaptic nerve terminals.</s><s>How SVs are reformed and maintain their compositional identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> is controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>One possibility is that upon fusion SV proteins remain clustered at the active zone-that is, by association between SV proteins-and are retrieved via "kissand-run" or ultrafast endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, thereby alleviating the need for specific sorting of individual SV proteins.</s><s>Alternatively, if SVs lose their identity during multiple rounds of exo-/endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, specific mechanisms exist to orchestrate high-fidelity SV protein sorting, either directly at the plasma membrane via slow clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or at endosome-like vacuoles generated by fast clathrin-independent membrane retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>Endocytic adaptors for SV protein sorting include the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (9), the synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 adaptor AP180 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and the AP-2μrelated protein stonin 2 (Stn2), a specific sorting adaptor for the SV calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>Although genetic inactivation of the Stn2 orthologs Stoned B and Unc41 in flies and worms is lethal due to defective neurotransmission caused by degradation and missorting of Syt1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>, Stn2 knockout (KO) mice are viable and able to internalize Syt1, albeit with reduced fidelity of sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, mammalian synapses, in contrast to invertebrates, have evolved mechanisms to sort Syt1 in the absence of its specific sorting adaptor Stn2.</s><s>One possibility is that Syt1 sorting in addition to its direct recognition by Stn2 is facilitated by complex formation with other SV proteins.</s><s>Likely candidates for such a piggyback mechanism are the SV2 family of transmembrane SV glycoproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>, which might regulate Syt1 function either via direct interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref> or by facilitating its binding to AP-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Apart from the distantly related SVOP protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, no close SV2 homologs exist in invertebrates, suggesting that SV2 fulfills a unique function at mammalian synapses.</s><s>KO of SV2A or combined loss of its major A and B isoforms in mice causes early postnatal lethality due to epileptic seizures <ref type="bibr"

trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, whereas SV2B KO mice are phenotypically normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Given that SV2A in addition to its association with Syt1 binds to endocytic proteins including AP-2 and Eps15 (25), SV2 would be a likely candidate for mediating Syt1 sorting to SVs.</s></p><p><s>Here we demonstrate that endocytic sorting of Syt1 is mediated by the overlapping activities of SV2A/B and Stn2.</s><s>Deletion or knockdown of either SV2A/B or Stn2 results in partial Syt1 loss and missorting of Syt1 to the neuronal surface, whereas deletion of both SV2A/B and Stn2 dramatically exacerbates this phenotype, resulting in severely impaired basal neurotransmission.</s><s>Our results favor a model according to which SV protein sorting

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Brain function depends on neurotransmission, and alterations in this process are linked to neurological disorders.</s><s>Neurotransmitter release requires the rapid recycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs) by endocytosis.</s><s>How synapses maintain the molecular composition of SVs during recycling is poorly understood.</s><s>We demonstrate that overlapping functions of two completely distinct proteins, the vesicle protein SV2A/B and the adaptor stonin 2, mediate endocytic sorting of the vesicular calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1.</s><s>As SV2A is the target of the commonly used antiepileptic drug levetiracetam and is linked to late onset Alzheimer's disease, our findings bear implications for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Exacerbated Loss of Syt1 Upon Combined Deletion of Stn2 and SV2A/B.</s></p><p><s>Previous work has suggested putative functions of both Stn2 and SV2 in sorting of Syt1 to SVs with Syt1 levels being reduced in brain sections from KO mice lacking Stn2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and in SVs isolated from brains of SV2A/B KO mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s><s>Given this phenotypic similarity, we hypothesized that Stn2 and SV2A/B fulfill overlapping roles with respect to Syt1 sorting and maintenance in the mammalian brain.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression levels of endocytic proteins including Stn2 in double knockout (DKO) mice lacking SV2A and B. Indeed, Stn2 levels were significantly increased in brain extracts from SV2A/B DKO mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A and B), whereas Syt1 expression was reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), in agreement with earlier data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s><s>The levels of other endocytic proteins such as clathrin, AP-2, and dynamin1-3, or of synaptophysin (Syp), another major SV protein, were not significantly different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A, C, and D</ref>).</s><s>Thus, loss of SV2A/B results in a compensatory increase in the steady-state levels of Stn2 in vivo.</s><s>To further corroborate these data and to address whether the comparably mild phenotype of Stn2 loss in mice is due to functional compensation by SV2 family members, we crossed SV2A heterozygous (HET) and SV2B KO mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> with KO mice lacking Stn2 (14) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>), resulting in offspring that lack both SV2A/B and Stn2 (hereafter referred to as triple KO; TKO).</s><s>TKOs appeared normal at birth, but ∼70% of the offspring died within the first 3 d of their postnatal live.</s><s>This phenotype is more severe than that of DKO, with about 50% lethality in our hands.</s><s>The remaining TKO mice survived for up to 2 wk but lagged behind their control littermates in postnatal development and weight gain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 B and C</ref>) and experienced major neurological defects, as revealed by poor motor coordination and spontaneous epileptic seizures.</s><s>We then analyzed the effect of deleting SV2A/B alone or in combination with Stn2 on the steady-state levels of Syt1.</s><s>TKO mice displayed a significant further reduction of Syt1 expression compared with control or DKO, whereas Syp levels were normal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A and C</ref>), consistent with the selective association of Stn2 with Syt1 but not with other SV proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>As expected, Syt1 levels were reduced in the hippocampus of DKO mice, and this reduction was further aggravated in TKO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 E and F</ref>).</s><s>No significant alterations in the levels of synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 or of the SV-associated phosphoprotein synapsin 1 were observed in hippocampal sections from either DKO or TKO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 G-J</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this, Schaffer collateral synapses from DKO and TKO mice displayed normal numbers, morphology, and organization of SVs compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that SV2A/B and Stn2 fulfill overlapping functions in maintaining vesicular Syt1 at central synapses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Deficiency of SV2 and Stn2 Causes Additive Defects in Syt1</head><p><s>Sorting.</s><s>The findings described above suggest that SV2 and Stn2, despite their distinct molecular features, execute shared overlapping functions with respect to Syt1 maintenance at mammalian synapses in vivo.</s><s>To corroborate this hypothesis and to bypass the problem that the majority of DKO mice experience severe seizures and die soon after birth, we used siRNA-mediated gene knockdown to deplete SV2A in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 A-D</ref>).</s><s>SV2A knockdown reduced the levels of endogenous SV2A levels to about 35% of that observed in controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 A-C</ref>), and this was accompanied by a roughly 20% decrease in the levels of Syt1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D</ref>), similar although slightly less pronounced to what we observed in the brain from SV2A/B DKO mice (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Partial loss of Syt1 in SV2Adepleted neurons was rescued by plasmid-based reexpression of siRNA-resistant SV2A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2D</ref>).</s><s>Recent data show that repartitioning of Syt1 to the neuronal surface in Stn2 KO neurons is accompanied by an increased rate of SV membrane retrieval during high-frequency stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore studied whether combined depletion of both Stn2 and SV2 further accelerates SV membrane retrieval by analyzing the kinetics of Syt1 exo-/endocytosis using a chimera carrying the pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein pHluorin (Syt1-pHluorin) in response to high-frequency stimulation with 200 APs at 40 Hz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> A and B).</s><s>As expected, retrieval of Syt1-pHluorin was significantly facilitated in neurons derived from Stn2 KO mice (τ KO = 35.1 ± 1.2 s) or depleted of SV2A by siRNA (τ KD = 34.5 ± 1.8 s), compared with controls (τ scr = 43.1 ± 3.6 s).</s><s>This phenotype was further aggravated by combined deficiency of both SV2A and Stn2 (τ KO,SV2KD = 25.3 ± 1.0 s) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), possibly by shunting the pathway of SV membrane retrieval toward a fast clathrinindependent mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Similar results were obtained in SV2A KD neurons expressing Syp-pHluorin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2F</ref>), indicating that the increased rate of membrane retrieval is independent of the pHluorin sensor used.</s></p><p><s>Next, we studied the role of SV2A and Stn2 in Syt1 sorting.</s><s>To directly probe Syt1 sorting between internal vesicular and surfacestranded pools in the absence of SV2A and Stn2, we performed acid quenching-dequenching experiments (8) of cultured neurons expressing Syt1-pHluorin.</s><s>Combined deficiency of SV2A and Stn2 further increased the ratio between surface-stranded and total Syt1-pHluorin compared with neurons depleted either of SV2A or Stn2 alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>To probe for sorting of endogenous Syt1, we applied antibodies that specifically recognize the luminal domain (LD) of Syt1 without prior membrane permeabilization to detect surfacestranded Syt1 and compared their relative levels to the total pool of Syt1.</s><s>As expected, SV2A loss increased the surface accumulation of endogenous Syt1 in neurons from Stn2 KO mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 G-I</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the ratio of endogenous surface-stranded/total Syt1 was elevated in hippocampal slices from SV2A/B DKO mice, and this defect was further aggravated in TKO mice lacking SV2A/B and Stn2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 D and E</ref>), consistent with our data in cultured neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate that SV2A and Stn2 execute overlapping functions with respect to selective sorting of Syt1 to SVs.</s></p><p><s>SV2 Regulates Syt1 Sorting to SVs During Neuronal Activity.</s><s>Syt1 repartitioning between vesicular and surface pools in the absence of SV2 and/or Stn2 likely is a consequence of its defective endocytic sorting postexocytosis and thus should depend on synaptic activity within the neuronal network.</s><s>To test this hypothesis we analyzed the levels of surface-stranded Syt1 in cultured control or SV2A-deficient neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) in the absence or presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX).</s><s>As expected, loss of SV2A led to elevated Syt1 surface-to-total pool ratios compared with controls [scrambled (scr), 1.0 ± 0.08; SV2A KD, 1.62 ± 0.13; P &lt; 0.001], a phenotype rescued by reexpression of siRNA-resistant SV2A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>).</s><s>Syt1 surface stranding was completely eliminated by silencing neuronal activity in the presence of TTX (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Surface levels of Syp, a SV protein that neither associates with SV2 nor is sorted by Stn2, taken as a control were unaltered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, loss of SV2A selectively impairs endocytic retrieval of Syt1 to SVs during neuronal activity.</s><s>As a consequence of impaired Syt1 sorting in the absence of SV2A and/or Stn2, recycled SVs are expected to contain reduced Syt1 copy numbers.</s><s>To monitor the relative copy number of Syt1 on SVs actively undergoing recycling (9), we subjected neurons expressing Syt1-pHluorin to sustained stimulation with a train of 200 APs applied at 10 Hz, a stimulation paradigm known to trigger the rapid reuse of SVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and to increase release probability due to the accumulation of residual calcium <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>When combined with the application of the vesicular ATPase blocker folimycin, which prevents reacidification of internalized membranes (28) (i.e., blinding pHluorin signals for endocytosis), this allowed us to selectively monitor the relative number of pHluorin molecules undergoing exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> under conditions that bypass the exocytosis defects reported at synapses of DKO mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>We imaged boutons from control or SV2A-deficient neurons expressing plasmid-encoded Syt1-pHluorin at near identical levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2J</ref>).</s><s>Neurons were stimulated first in the absence, then in the presence of folimycin, and the relative number of exocytosed Syt1-pHluorin molecules was quantified (ΔF) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 C-F</ref>).</s><s>Depletion of SV2A significantly reduced the apparent number of exocytosed Syt1-pHluorin molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 C, D, and G</ref>), whereas the number of exocytosed Syp-pHluorin molecules was unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 E, F, and H</ref>), suggesting that SVs undergoing exocytosis contain a reduced Syt1 copy number.</s><s>These data show that loss of SV2A causes a partial depletion of Syt1 from recycling SVs, consistent with biochemical data from SV2A/B-deficient mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Combined Deficiency of SV2 and Stn2 Aggravates Impairments in Synaptic Strength and Short-Term Plasticity Caused by Deletion of SV2.</s><s>The drastic loss of Syt1 from SVs and its missorting to the plasma membrane in synapses from SV2A/B DKO, and more pronouncedly in TKO synapses, might impact the efficacy of neurotransmitter release.</s><s>To address this, we measured synaptic responses of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices derived from p12 SV2A/B DKO or SV2A/B/Stn2 TKO mice.</s><s>For comparison we measured evoked neurotransmission and paired-pulse responses from SV2A-WT/SV2B-KO/Stn2-WT (WT/KO/WT) or SV2A-WT/SV2B-KO/Stn2-HET (WT/KO/HET) littermates as controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> F and G).</s><s>First, we analyzed evoked neurotransmission [field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitudes] in response to increasing stimulus intensities and plotted the data as input-output curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4 A  and B</ref>).</s><s>In slices from SV2A/B DKO mice, the size of maximal fEPSPs was decreased about twofold compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>This effect was exacerbated in slices from TKOs where maximal fEPSP sizes were reduced additionally by 20% compared with the DKO amplitude (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>These reduced postsynaptic responses in DKO and TKO mice were not a result of decreased presynaptic input, as evident in measurements of fiber volley amplitudes plotted as a function of increasing stimulus intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> A and B).</s><s>Moreover, CA1 synapses from DKO or TKO mice also displayed a normal overall morphology with unaltered numbers of SVs or length of the active zone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to evoked neurotransmission, neither the frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> C and D) nor the amplitude of mEPSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> C and E) was altered in slices from TKO mice, akin to what has been

facilitation in DKO and TKO synapses we observed is, thus, unlikely to be caused by alterations in refilling of the releasable SV pool and may rather be a consequence of the reduced ability of SVs

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our data reported here unravel a crucial overlapping function of the endocytic adaptor Stn2 and the SV protein SV2A/B in Syt1 sorting and maintenance at mammalian synapses.</s><s>The observation that loss of Stn2 and SV2 has additive effects with respect to Syt1 repartitioning to the neuronal plasma membrane (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2  and 3</ref>), Syt1 levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and neurotransmission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) further argues that Stn2 and SV2 operate via distinct genetically separable mechanisms to facilitate Syt1 sorting to SVs, in agreement with their distinctive molecular properties.</s><s>Such a model is consistent with prior observations that SVs isolated from SV2A/B KO mice contain reduced levels of Syt1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and with impaired sorting of Syt1 but not other SV proteins to internal vesicular pools in the absence of Stn2 in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>The overlapping function of Stn2 and SV2A/B in sorting of Syt1 to SVs explains why loss of stonin expression in invertebrate neurons results in a dramatic loss of Syt1 expression and corresponding defects in neurotransmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>, whereas KO of Stn2 expression in mammalian central neurons exhibits comparably mild phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore propose that mammalian neurons, in addition to sorting SV proteins based on cargo-specific endocytic adaptors such as Stn2, have evolved piggy-back mechanisms to safeguard SV protein sorting to maintain evoked neurotransmission.</s><s>For example, recent data indicate that the SV SNARE Syb2 not only is recognized by its specific endocytic adaptors AP180 and CALM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref> but also uses a complex formation with Syp for efficient sorting in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s><s>The fact that invertebrates do not express close homologs of SV2 or Syp further suggests that sorting of SV proteins by complex formation between vesicle proteins (36) may be a unique specialization of the mammalian central nervous system.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> we find that loss of SV2A/B impairs the efficiency of stimulus-evoked SV exocytosis, a phenotype that is accompanied by the loss of Syt1 from SVs. Strikingly, the efficacy of neurotransmission is further reduced at synapses from SV2A/B/Stn2 TKO mice (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), and this correlates with exacerbated missorting and loss of Syt1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Several studies have suggested that SV2 proteins govern synaptic plasticity by regulating residual calcium <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>, release probability, and/or the size of the readily-releasable pool of SVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Our results agree with these findings (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) and suggest that SV2 proteins modulate the efficacy of neurotransmitter release at least in part via chaperoning Syt1 sorting during activity-dependent SV recycling.</s><s>Interestingly, it appears that maintenance of high vesicular Syt1 levels by SV2 and Stn2 is particularly crucial for evoked neurotransmission, whereas the comparably few copies of Syt1 on SVs of TKO animals suffice to repress spontaneous fusion events.</s></p><p><s>What is the possible advantage of this apparent complexity of SV protein sorting in mammalian neurons?</s><s>First, the use of multiple parallel mechanisms for sorting of SV proteins such as Syt1 likely increases both the efficiency of sorting as well as the robustness of the system to disturbances.</s><s>Second, the formation of SV protein assemblies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref> may alleviate the need to specifically sort each SV component during every round of exo-/endocytosis and SV reformation.</s><s>Rather, it would allow rapid bulk retrieval of SV membranes-that is, by ultrafast or bulk endocytosis (6, 38)-followed by clathrin-and adaptor-mediated SV reformation from internal endosome-like structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref> during phases of high-frequency synaptic activity.</s><s>In agreement with the view that endocytic membrane retrieval and SV protein sorting occur by largely distinct mechanisms, we failed to observe major kinetic defects in Syt1 retrieval even in SV2A-deficient Stn2 KO neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), where Syt1 is extensively missorted to the neuronal surface.</s><s>In this model, endocytic sorting adaptors such as Stn2, rather than being essential components of the machinery for membrane retrieval, may serve a "proofreading" function to monitor the compositional identity of newly formed SVs, whereas surface-stranded SV proteins may be targeted for degradation by autophagy and/or the endolysosomal pathway.</s><s>Whether the reduced levels of Syt1 observed in SV2A/B/Stn2 TKO neurons are indeed the result of facilitated Syt1 degradation will need to be addressed in future studies.</s><s>Given the putative genetic association of Stn2 with neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref> and the role of SV2A in late onset Alzheimer's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref> and as a major target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>, our results may also be of relevance for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders in humans.</s></p></div>
