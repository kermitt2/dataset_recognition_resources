<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Updated calibration for Germany</head><p><s>For the updated calibration of 10-year risk of CVD based on the SCORE methodology, recent national estimates of age-and sex-specific mean levels of the risk factors SBP, smoking and cholesterol (TC or TC/HDL-C) from the DEGS1 2008-2011 study were used.</s><s>The investigations of the DEGS1 study were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, including written informed consent of all participants.</s><s>All study methods were approved by the ethics committee of Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the federal data protection and deral data protection and freedom of information authority.</s><s>The examination sample of DEGS1 included 7.115 participants aged 18-79 years from a Germany-wide two-stage clustered sample from local population registries with standardized measurements and interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</s><s>TC and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured using an enzymatic assay (Architect ci8200, Abbott, Germany).</s><s>Non-HDL-C was calculated by subtracting HDL-C from TC.</s><s>Three blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken at the right arm at 3-minute intervals after a non-strenuous part of the examination and an additional 5-minute rest with an automated oscillometric device (Datascope Accutorr Plus, Mahwah, NJ).</s><s>Participants sat on a height-adjustable chair, back supported, arm lying on a table at heart level, feet on the floor and legs uncrossed.</s><s>Three different cuff sizes were used.</s><s>The second and third measurements were averaged <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Smoking was defined as current self-reported smoking.</s><s>In order to account for the unequal sampling probabilities related to the sampling design and nonresponse, statistical analyses were weighted using a weighting factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> and the complex survey sampling was taken into account using complex samples procedures in SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).</s></p><p><s>The updated calibration also used recent mortality data from Germany.</s><s>Sex-stratified and 5-year age aggregated number of deaths from CVD and non-CVD (CVD: ICD-10 I10-I15, I20-I25, I44-I51 and I61-I73) and the number of inhabitants from the year 2012 were collected from official mortality statistics.</s><s>We used competing risk model that utilizes the cumulative incidence function to calculate the average absolute risk of dying from CVD.</s><s>The competing risks model allows for the fact that there are competing causes of death that influence the actual likelihood of dying from CVD. Non-CVD death was considered as being the competing event and death from CVD the event of interest.</s><s>It was assumed that the relative risks of the respective risk factors didn't change over the years.</s><s>Therefore, relative risks for CVD mortality were derived from an analysis of the entire SCORE database <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The statistical method for the updated calibration is based on the methodology introduced previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> but was slightly modified as follows: The calibration from 2005 interpolated the 5-year mortality rates to get the average absolute risk of dying in the next ten years.</s><s>In the new approach the 5-year mortality rates were held constant.</s><s>No interpolation was used, because a linear interpolation disagrees with the Markov assumption.</s><s>Therefore, the estimates of age-and sex-specific mean levels of the risk factors were evaluated with regression models using age in constant 5-year age groups and not as a continuous variable.</s><s>Thus, separate risk estimations for the 40-45 and for the 45-49 year olds were provided in contrast to the 2005 calibration.</s><s>As a sensitivity analysis, an independent recalculation of the risk charts using the original approach was performed by one of the authors who was blinded to the current recalibration analysis (APF).</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed in R 3.1.1.</s><s>A detailed description of the recalibration methods is provided in the Supporting information (S1 File).</s></p></div>

target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> have been updated successfully based on the SCORE methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>More than a decade after the first calibration of the SCORE charts for Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> these updated charts reflect the decreasing trend in CVD mortality in Germany as well as recent trends towards lower risk factor levels.</s><s>As expected, the predicted absolute risk generally decreased.</s><s>The use of the calibrated charts from 2005 for Germany showed a substantially higher population risk in a representative sample of the general population living in Germany aged 40 to 65 years compared to the updated estimates.</s></p><p><s>Germany has seen a marked decline in cardiovascular mortality in the period between the two risk chart calibrations.</s><s>The calibration published in 2005 and the updated calibrations are based on mortality data from 1998 and 2012 respectively, a period in which stroke mortality declined by 51%, ischemic heart disease mortality by 45% and overall CVD mortality by 36% (www.gbe-bund.de;</s><s>mortality rates per 100.000</s><s>inhabitants standardized to the population in Germany 2011).</s><s>In addition, there have been substantial changes in risk factor levels, as documented by the two national health surveys conducted in 1998 and 2008-2011.</s><s>For example, blood pressure declined considerably (both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, cholesterol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and the proportion of smokers in the German population decreased slightly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, the fall in CVD mortality might only be partly explained by the changes in risk factors as the chart predicts individual risk at specific risk factors levels and, thus, we wouldn't expect major changes in the risk chart if the observed decrease in mortality would be entirely explained by risk factor changes.</s></p><p><s>Numerous risk charts exist for estimating CVD risk.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref> In particular newer risk charts acknowledge the need to issue risk charts for individual countries and recalibrate them regularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The first recalibration of the risk charts for Germany based on the SCORE project resulted in risk estimates that were between those of SCORE for high-risk and those of SCORE for low-risk countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The updated risk charts presented in this paper make further adjustments toward lower risk while still lying between SCORE-high and SCORE-low <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>More than 40% of the 480 cells in the risk charts for Germany are higher and around 1% are lower in comparison to the original SCORE-low risk chart cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In the updated risk charts the age group 40-49 is divided into two age groups, 40-44 and 45-49 years.</s><s>This allows for a more precise prediction of the absolute risk.</s><s>Predicted risk is generally lower according to the updated risk charts compared to the first SCORE-Deutschland risk charts.</s><s>However, due to rounding of the predicted risk presented in the chart cells rounded predicted risk is numerically the same in more than half of the cells.</s></p><p><s>Other risk charts are also used in Germany such as the PROCAM score <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>, which is based on an occupational cohort from the northwest of Germany, as well as charts like ARRIBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> and CARRISMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, which are based on adaptations of Framingham risk scores.</s><s>These charts, however, do not take into account the recent declines in CVD and CVD risk factors in Germany.</s><s>Results of a German survey on the use of routine risk-scores among physicians showed that more than 50% of the participating physicians believe that risk-scores for CVD are useful for the successful prevention and treatment of CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is important that a regular update of the risk-scores based on the current risk factor and mortality distribution of the general population is available.</s></p><p><s>Our study has certain strengths and limitations.</s><s>Our recalibration has been confirmed by independent recalculation.</s><s>The strengths of risk charts based on the SCORE methodology include the large database of European cohorts and the simple and inexpensive use due to restriction to only a few key risk factors.</s><s>The original SCORE chart combined separate predictions of CHD and stroke mortality. 6</s><s>The method presented here is based directly on national CVD mortality which allows for a more straightforward recalibration.</s><s>This is of great importance since CVD mortality as well as risk factor levels have been changing considerably in the last decades in many countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27]</ref>.</s><s>However, two aspects of the SCORE-recalibration may lead to an overestimation of the absolute CVD risk in the general population without preexisting CVD.</s><s>Ideally, calibration would not require national mortality statistics (which include people with previous CVD who have a higher 10-year-mortality risk than those without a previous CVD), but recent and regional data on mortality of a population free of CVD at baseline.</s><s>This could be approximated from national mortality statistics with recent and regional CVD incidence data, which, however, are currently lacking.</s><s>The second aspect is that the competing risk principle is only applied to the country-specific baseline risk but not in the Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios.</s><s>This could be solved by using a Fine and Gray Model with competing risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref> in the 12 original cohorts of the SCORE Project, but is computationally challenging in the presence of left censoring and a model with age as time variable.</s><s>Finally, it is a general limitation of the SCORE charts that they are limited to fatal CVD prediction and to the age range 40 to 65 years.</s><s>However, the original SCORE data support robust risk estimation only for fatal CVD and only in this age range.</s><s>Risk prediction for higher age groups would only be possible by adding cohort data in a higher age range as shown in a recent Norwegian example <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>.</s></p></div>
