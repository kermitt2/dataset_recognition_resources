<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Child physical abuse (CPA) is an extensive public health problem because of its associations with poor health outcomes.</s><s>The aim of this study was to examine which of the background factors of CPA committed by a parent or other caregiver relates to self-reported poor health among girls and boys (13; 15 and 17 years old): perpetrator, last year exposure; severity and frequency; socioeconomic load and foreign background.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p><s>In a cross-sectional study in a Swedish county (n = 8024) a path analysis was performed to evaluate a model where all background variables were put as predictors of three health-status variables: mental; physical and general health problems.</s><s>In a second step a log linear analysis was performed to examine how the distribution over the health-status categories was different for different combinations of background factors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>Children exposed to CPA reported poor health to a much higher extent than those who were not exposed.</s></p><p><s>In the path analysis it was found that frequency and severity of abuse (boys only) and having experienced CPA during the last year, was significantly associated with poor health as well as socioeconomic load in the families.</s><s>Foreign background was significantly negatively associated with all three health indicators especially for girls.</s><s>Neither mother nor father as perpetrator remained significant in the path analysis, while the results from the log linear analyses showed that mother-abuse did in fact relate to poor general health and mental as well as physical health problems among boys and girls.</s><s>Father-abuse was associated with poor mental health if severe abuse was reported.</s><s>Poor mental health was also associated with mild father-abuse if exposure during the last year was reported.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>Despite the limitations that cross-sectional studies imply, this study provides new knowledge about factors associated with poor health among physically abused children.</s><s>It describes details of CPA that have significant associations to different aspects of poor health and thus what needs to be addressed by professionals within mental health providers and social services.</s><s>Understanding how different factors may contribute to different health outcomes for exposed children is important in future research and needs further studies.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Frequency and type/severity of abuse</head><p><s>In a previous study it was found that there was a doseresponse effect between frequency of CPA and selfreported ill health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In Sweden where all corporal punishment has been considered a crime for almost 40 years, the use of physical violence in child rearing has become more unusual.</s></p><p><s>The immediate consequences of CPA are physical pain, acute stress and potential physical injuries.</s><s>The most common injuries from physical abuse are marks from beatings and kicks.</s><s>Bruises in unusual places or bruises of different ages might indicate abuse.</s><s>But CPA also includes more severe violence and injuries which can cause life-long consequences or even be life-threatening <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>In a Swedish school survey in 2011 (15-16 year olds), one-third of the children who reported CPA (in total 13.8%), reported that they had been exposed at some point to more severe types such as harder beatings with the hand/fist, kicked, scalded, squeezed on the throat or that they had been beaten with an object <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In a study of cases of CPA reported to the police in Sweden, the share of severe cases including striking the child with an object or against a surface, choking the child or beating up the child was 41% <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>There are reasons to believe that the more severe forms have greater impact, since they are likely to be more painful, more frightening and thereby also more psychologically traumatizing.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on how different types/different severity of CPA influences the relations with poor self-reported health.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study aimed to contribute to the field of research on CPA by examining how different characteristics of abuse were associated with poor health in a group of children who reported that they had been exposed to physical abuse by a caregiver.</s><s>The study shows that children exposed to CPA reported poor health to a higher extent than those who were not exposed.</s><s>Associations between characteristics of the abuse and other background factors and poor health were examined in two different types of analysis: one path analysis and in addition in log linear analysis.</s><s>The hypothesis, that violence perpetrated by mothers and fathers (with stepparent as base-line), is associated with the worst outcomes of CPA was not supported by the results in the path analysis where all the prerequisite variables were put together in a base-model.</s><s>Since the hypothesis might still be valid in groups with different characteristics of background variables, this issue was examined further.</s><s>The results from the log linear analyses showed that mother-abuse did in fact relate to mental as well as physical and general health problems.</s><s>For those experiencing mild father-abuse there was a positive association with mental health problems if the abuse had occurred during the last year otherwise there was a negative association.</s><s>Mother-abuse is associated with poor self-reported health more often than father-abuse and does not seem to be affected by last year experience in the same way.</s><s>Why CPA performed by mothers has more effect on health problems might be explained by attachment theory since mothers are often the most important attachment figures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>This is partly supported by the study of Nilsson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where children abused by their mothers reported their mothers' parenting as more negative when mothers only or both parents were perpetrators of the abuse compared to only fathers as perpetrators.</s><s>Further studies are required, to more clearly elucidate the question of the impact of CPA performed by primary attachment figures in comparison with violence from other caregivers.</s><s>Previous research has given conflicting results on this point <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Further, in the path analysis it was found that frequency and severity (boys only) of abuse and having experienced CPA during the last year (especially boys) was significantly associated with poor health as well as socioeconomic load in the families.</s><s>The fact that higher frequency of abuse and socioeconomic problems are strongly associated with self-reported ill health among boys and girls is consistent with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another demographic factor, foreign origin had a partial opposite influence on self-reported health.</s><s>The exposed children with foreign origin reported significantly fewer health problems than the exposed children of Swedish origin, although the association was not significant in the separate analysis for boys.</s><s>One possible explanation of this difference might be cultural differences connected to CPA.</s><s>In Sweden, where all violence against children has been banned for almost 40 years, exposure to violence from a caregiver has come to be viewed as a deviant experience.</s><s>For the Swedish children this experience may be perceived as exclusion in society and lead to marginalization for the abused children and thus result in poorer health <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>The same behavior might not have the same impact if the internal family values are more permissive towards corporal punishment and is normalized in families or groups of children of foreign origin where corporal punishment is more prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>These results thus seem to support the hypothesis of resilience in more disadvantaged groups due to the probability that these children have grown up with other stressors in life and other cultural factors that can buffer the effects of abuse, as described in Widom et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another assumption is that CPA is not associated with other family problems to the same extent in families of foreign origin as in families with Swedish origin, where all violence against children is considered to be abnormal and prohibited.</s><s>Perhaps families of foreign origin can offer their children support in a way that is protective against poor health despite the violence.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the study shows that a relatively high proportion of older children in their teens report being abused during the last year, especially boys and that this contributes to poor self-perceived health.</s><s>The finding of high proportion of last year experience of CPA corresponds with Finkelhor et al. who found that last year experience of abuse was frequently reported by 14-17 years old adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In the current study all the three age groups (13, 15 and 17 years old) reported that they had been abused in the last year, although the prevalence of last year exposure was more common at the younger ages.</s><s>These results correspond with Radford et al. who found that last year experiences rise from ages 11-12, peak between ages 13-16 and then decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations/methodological considerations</head><p><s>The present study has several possible limitations.</s><s>First, the cross-sectional design implies lack of temporal ordering of incidents, which limits the possibility of addressing the question of causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Second, the data are based on self-reports of experiences in the past.</s><s>Gilbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> discussed the complexity of the phenomenon of child abuse and of research design in the field.</s><s>They proposed that it would be desirable that research on consequences of child abuse consisted of prospective cohort studies, but in the same article they also discussed the problems such designs imply since official cases of abuse do not represent the population of all abused children.</s><s>The retrospective nature of data also implies potential recall bias since children cannot report occasions that happened during their first years.</s><s>In addition to this, another limitation of the study might be that we do not have data on the actual age of exposure, except if it occurred in the last year.</s><s>Age of exposure might affect the outcome in health <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Third, this study focuses solely on physical abuse which might be another limitation since there are not adjustments for concurrent other types of abuse.</s><s>Child abuse, however, is a complex phenomenon and is characterized by multifactorial patterns and it is a challenge to find adequate methods in this research-area.</s><s>There are also difficulties in determining causality between the abuse experience and health problems in longitudinal studies because there are several unknown factors that might affect the outcomes.</s><s>In a Swedish study of CPAcases reported to the police, a 5-year follow-up revealed that much had happened in the children's lives after the reports that were not directly linked to the abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, there are several other changes that occur naturally in young people's lives.</s><s>Overall, these circumstances may affect the health of young people as well as experiences of abuse do and could be regarded as a mutual limitation in different types of study design <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Fourth, another type of bias, dependent measurement bias, implies that false associations can occur due to problems in measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>One source of such bias in connection to questionnaire based studies, is that the stable personality traits of the participants in a study means that they tend to consistently report the most "negative" alternatives while others score the most "positive" <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>In this study however, it might be assumed that pupils would rather tend to overreport, alternatively underreport both exposure (abuse) and outcome (health) and that skewness in results would not arise.</s><s>This also touches upon the problem of that outcome and predictor variables were assessed by the same individual, which tends to strengthen relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>It was on the other hand not in the framework for this large study where data was collected anonymously from the children themselves.</s><s>Further the use of different informants bring new problems with informant variance (see e.g.</s><s>Edelbrock <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>) concerning mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and child maltreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the drop-out of children absent from school the day the questionnaire was given out may distort the results since this might be a group of more disadvantaged pupils.</s><s>Their absence could depend on truancy or illness and lead to an underestimation of the true prevalence of physical abuse as well as poor health.</s></p><p><s>One strength of the present study implies the use of anonymous questionnaire in the school situation (away from home and without parental immediate influence) provides an opportunity to obtain information about the real extent of children's exposure to and the implications of CPA.</s><s>The confidentiality of the survey makes it possible for children to answer these sensitive issues.</s><s>Only eight percent of the abused had told any authority about their exposure implying that this study-design captures a quite different spectrum of children than a clinical sample would do.</s><s>The fact that the study was performed in a representative group of the general youth population, in other words a non-clinical group of children, is another strength of this study, not to mention the large sample and the overall high response rate which have made it possible to perform analyses of different subgroups.</s><s>The addition of the question of last year exposure, is an improvement compared with many previous studies since it allows for more accurate reporting of prevalence avoiding recall bias to the same extent that occurs if one asks for life-time experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is still important to measure both lifetime and point prevalence (last year exposure) to examine the associations between abuse and poor health.</s></p><p><s>Finally, it is important to note that in this study analyses were performed in a group consisting only of exposed children and characteristics of CPA and other background factors are solely compared to each other.</s><s>In studies also including non-exposed children, figures of correlations between abuse and poor health would probably been higher since previous studies show that exposed children report poor health more than not exposed children do <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study adds to the literature, suggestions of how different characteristics and background factors are associated with poor health among children exposed to CPA.</s><s>In the existing literature on child maltreatment there are many studies on how single characteristics of the abuse are associated with outcomes of poor health.</s><s>To our best knowledge, no previous studies have compared these factors in order to examine which ones that have the greatest impact on health or how they interact with each other.</s></p></div>
