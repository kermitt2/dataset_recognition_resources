<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>As part of an investigation of the immunopathogenesis of C-IRIS in patients co-infected with CM, we have shown that plasma-to-CSF ratios of HIV-1 RNA at ART initiation or at ND were not associated with the occurrence of C-IRIS but that CSF HIV-1 RNA levels correlated with CSF CXCL10 levels, whereas CSF cryptococcal burden, measured by CSF quantitative culture counts, correlated weakly with CSF levels of CCL2 and CCL3.</s><s>Together, these data suggest that in the context of CM co-infection, the amount of HIV-1 replication in the CNS relative to the plasma does not directly influence the development of C-IRIS and that production of pro-inflammatory chemokines is affected differently by HIV-1 and cryptococcosis.</s><s>The association between CSF HIV-1 RNA and CSF CXCL10 has previously been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Our finding that residual CNS cryptococcal burden is not associated with CXCL10 levels but rather with CSF CCL2 and CCL3 levels provides evidence that HIV-1 and cryptococcosis are driving different inflammatory mechanisms that might impact on the outcome of advanced HIV-CM co-infection.</s><s>Advanced HIV infection leads not only to T-cell depletion but also a progressively dysfunctional innate system, which is a vital defense against fungal infection.</s><s>We have previously shown the importance of CSF cryptococcal sterility at ART initiation in reducing future ND events, C-IRIS, and cryptococcal relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and we suggested the importance of CD8 + T-cell and myeloid cell trafficking into the CNS in the development of C-IRIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Our findings here reiterate the possibility of an imbalance in cellular trafficking into the CNS, which defaults towards non-CD4 + T-cell-mediated immune responses, including innate immune responses, as is increasingly recognized in C-IRIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Higher CNS fungal burden was not associated with CSF viral burden-this undermines the simplistic hypothesis of passive leakage of Cryptococcus spp and HIV through a breached BBB.</s><s>However, HIV-induced immune activation may attract cell types important also in fungal clearance, thereby outcompeting one for the other, or, alternatively, different cell types and signaling pathways are involved with resisting HIV and cryptococcal infections.</s></p><p><s>Despite CM being a severe CNS opportunistic infection, we found that overall, HIV-1 RNA is not higher in CSF than in plasma at CM presentation and at time of ND, suggesting that there is no distinguishable CNS viral escape from immune response nor ART when measured by quantitative viral burden.</s><s>Furthermore, higher CSF HIV-1 RNA levels were not associated with subsequent C-IRIS.</s><s>This suggests that immune dysfunction and cryptococcal factors, rather than greater HIV replication, are more likely to contribute to the development of C-IRIS.</s><s>Further work will need to address whether the anti-cryptococcal immune environment predisposes less favorably to HIV-1 replication.</s><s>Although there is a wide range of plasma-to-CSF HIV-1 RNA ratios in our cohort, overall this is low (median 2.6)-consistent with previous findings in which HIV-infected patients with CNS co-infections and those with neurological symptoms recorded lower ratios compared with neurologically asymptomatic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Central nervous system involvement in newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals is underappreciated.</s><s>It is worth noting that all of our patients have measurable HIV virus in the CSF, although it is perhaps surprising that despite their advanced meningeal infection, overall, their CSF viral load was still lower than their plasma viral load.</s><s>Cerebrospinal fluid HIV-1 escape from the effects of ART is rare when measured longitudinally <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Limitations of our study include the lack of HIV-1-and CM-mono-infected individuals as control groups and the lack of subsequent time-defined matched samples to measure viral and QnCC kinetics.</s><s>It is unfortunate that we were not able to perform an analysis at the time of CM diagnosis-antifungal agents may have had some variable impact on the chemokines and QnCC measured.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>In summary, our study suggests that disproportionately high viral burden in the CSF compared with blood is not commonly seen in HIV-CM co-infection and does not predict for C-IRIS.</s><s>Future studies are needed to better understand virus characteristics and the immune microenvironment such as mechanistic real-time viral killing assays, CSF microarray analyses for gene expression, and HIV viral genotypic and phenotypic characterization.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Cohort flowchart.</s><s>ART, antiretroviral therapy; C-IRIS, cryptococcosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; ND, neurological deterioration.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
