<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Overall, 219 patients were enrolled in Canada and Germany between 10 February 2015 and 16 June 2015; six were screen failures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The remaining 213 patients were randomized and all received at least one application of Cal/BD foam or gel.</s><s>Two patients discontinued, one of whom was excluded from the FAS.</s><s>Of the randomized patients, 118 had received a topical treatment in the previous 3 months.</s><s>Most patients (57.5%) had psoriasis of moderate severity based on PGA, and 84% had the disease for &gt;5 years (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SABA: baseline behaviour and attitudes</head><p><s>Approximately 50% of patients reported that psoriasis impacts their 'self-confidence' (59.0%), 'emotional wellbeing' (53.1%) and 'social life' (49.5%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S1</ref>).</s><s>Most patients were 'keen to try the newest treatments available' (90.0%) and reported that 'being able to apply treatment quickly is very important to me' (90.1%) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPA: overall patient preferences</head><p><s>Based on the SPA, patient preference for Cal/BD foam and gel was 50 : 50 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>); the treatment sequence did not significantly impact the responses.</s><s>Logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant age effect (P = 0.001), whereby younger  patients preferred Cal/BD foam and older patients preferred gel (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>); there were no significant findings for other baseline characteristics.</s><s>The reasons for the stated preferences were not very discriminatory.</s><s>However, for Cal/BD foam, size of application area and items related to feelings of relief and soothing seemed to be of importance (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>For Cal/BD gel, precision of application impacted patient preference (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TPUQ: evaluation of study treatments</head><p><s>Mean application, container and satisfaction domain scores were high for both Cal/BD foam and gel (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</s><s>There were significant differences in favour of Cal/BD foam for some formulation items (e.g.</s><s>'immediate feeling of relief' and 'felt soothing'), and in favour of Cal/BD gel for some application (e.g.</s><s>'ease of application' and 'ease of spreading'), container ('accurately dispense wanted amount') and formulation (e.g.</s><s>'odourless' and 'not greasy') items (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Satisfaction scores were similar between treatment groups.</s><s>Multiple regression analyses for TPUQ score differences demonstrated that patients aged 18-39 years preferred Cal/BD foam, while patients aged 40-59 years and ≥60 years preferred Cal/BD gel (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, a significant age effect was observed for Cal/BD gel (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S3</ref>), but not for Cal/BD foam.</s><s>The forward selection procedure also identified psoriasis distribution as a significant factor; there was a trend towards more favourable scores for Cal/BD foam in patients with localized distribution and in favour of gel for patients with widespread distribution (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TPUQ: comparison with latest topical treatment</head><p><s>Mean TPUQ domain scores were often significantly in favour of both Cal/BD foam and gel compared with LTT (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Scores for Cal/BD gel were generally higher than for LTT.</s><s>Most scores for Cal/BD foam were higher, although some related to ease of application and container items were comparable to LTT (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Greater differences between Cal/BD foam and gel vs. LTT occurred when the previous treatment was an ointment; smaller differences occurred when the LTT was 'other' (including solution, liquid, lotion or other; n = 12) (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The PSO-INSIGHTFUL study demonstrated that overall patient preference was similar between Cal/BD foam and gel, with both products scoring well on patient-reported assessments of usability and satisfaction.</s><s>This highlights that patients have different preferences for the topical treatment of psoriasis, suggesting that individualized approaches are important.</s><s>This is in agreement with a previous preference study, which concluded that there is no 'one size fits all' approach in psoriasis and that patient needs should be considered when deciding treatment regimens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>The current study was deliberately designed to minimize the impact of efficacy; however, as efficacy is an important factor in treatment adherence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> the results should be viewed in the context of the known efficacy profiles of Cal/BD foam <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and gel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>he main drivers for patients preferring Cal/BD foam over gel were items related to sensation (i.e.</s><s>'immediate feeling of relief' and 'felt soothing to my skin'), whereas Cal/BD gel scored significantly higher than foam for items related to ease of application, the ability to apply the medication on specific psoriatic lesions, and the user friendliness of the container.</s><s>Cal/BD gel also scored significantly higher than foam for the formulation-related items 'not greasy' and 'odourless'.</s><s>These findings agree with a previous analysis, in which patients rated the feel on the skin, the ease and speed of application, and messiness as important characteristics of a topical therapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>It is interesting to note that both Cal/BD foam and gel were preferred to the LTT that patients received, particularly when the LTT was an ointment or cream.</s><s>This is consistent with previous studies showing lower patient preference scores for ointments than for foam, gel and solution vehicles, primarily owing to the stickiness and messiness of ointment formulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>However, there is a potential selection bias in the comparison with LTT, as patients participating in the study may already have been dissatisfied with their last treatment options before enrolment.</s></p><p><s>Cal/BD gel was preferred by those with widespread distribution of psoriasis, whereas a trend for preference was noted for foam in patients with localized distribution.</s><s>Combined with the preference data related to ease of application described above, this may suggest that application of Cal/BD gel is most suitable for patients with small lesions distributed widely over the body, whereas patients with larger lesions may prefer application of Cal/BD foam.</s><s>Cal/BD foam was generally preferred by younger patients (aged 18-39 years), whereas Cal/BD gel tended to be preferred by older patients (aged ≥40 years).</s><s>Although we can only speculate, older patients may prefer the gel formulation as they are more familiar with it and find it easier to apply than the newer foam formulation, while younger patients may be more open to using a newer formulation such as foam.</s></p><p><s>The results of the PSO-INSIGHTFUL study should be interpreted with caution because of a lack of experience with the questionnaires used.</s><s>Of the six questionnaires that were used to assess patient preferences, two were validated (the DLQI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and VPM 25 ); however, the remaining four questionnaires (SABA, TPUQ, CLTT and SPA) were developed by LEO Pharma based on work by Zschocke et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and were used for the first time in this study.</s><s>Patient and focus group interviews were conducted to assess the construct and content validity of these four questionnaires to ensure that they assessed clinically important, relevant issues, that the domains were logical and that the questionnaires were understood by patients.</s><s>The observed results are consistent across the validated and LEO-generated questionnaires, suggesting that the data obtained from the latter are robust.</s><s>In addition, the fact that there were many similar questions related to the application and formulation items may contribute to a high weighting of these questions on the sum scores that were used in the regression analyses.</s><s>On a similar note, the specific reasons for patient preferences are not ranked, and it is difficult to discriminate between the factors driving preference; this may be related to a lack of sensitivity within the questionnaires.</s><s>Finally, as the statistical analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing, all P values should be evaluated with this in mind.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the PSO-INSIGHTFUL study demonstrates that patients with psoriasis have diverse needs and different preferences for topical treatment, which are influenced by several factors such as age, psoriasis distribution and LTT.</s><s>This knowledge may help prescribers choose the right formulation for the right patient, which could potentially lead to improved adherence and better treatment outcomes.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure2Patient disposition.</s><s>*Four patients had previously received Cal/BD gel;
