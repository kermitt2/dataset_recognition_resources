126 class II substrates that require the GroE system at 37 ˚C but not at 25 ˚C; and 84 class III substrates that were found to be obligatory clients.</s><s>A re-evaluation of class III proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> led to defining a class IV that includes class III proteins that were verified to be stringent substrates and a small number of other proteins.</s><s>Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that there is a core set of 57 E. coli proteins that are confirmed obligate substrates of the GroE system, i.e. proteins that will not fold in vivo or in vitro at 25 or 37 ˚C without GroE.</s></p><p><s>Mollicutes are a class of bacteria that lack a cell wall and are among the self-replicating organisms with the smallest genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>They are of special interest since members of this class are the only known organisms that lack a chaperonin system.</s><s>The evolutionary track that led to the disappearance of the GroE system in most mollicute species and to its reappearance in some is not known but it is clear that there are closely related mollicute species that differ in whether they do or do not contain a chaperonin system.</s></p><p><s>Previously, Clark and Tillier <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> concluded that mollicutes did not evolve a protein that can functionally substitute for the GroE system.</s><s>Hence, it was of interest to determine how mollicute homologs of the obligatory GroE clients in E. coli are able to fold in mollicute species that lack GroE.</s><s>Towards this end, we compared mollicute species with a GroE homolog (GroE + ) and those without one (GroE -).</s><s>We then compared various properties of the homologs of the E. coli obligate GroE substrates (clients) and the E. coli control proteins (non-clients) in these two groups in order to determine whether, for example, certain types of sequence changes occurred that were able to compensate for the absence of a chaperonin system.</s><s>This question has also been examined in previous more limited studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> that focused on a smaller number of mollicute species and fewer properties.</s><s>Here, a larger set (59) of mollicute species is analyzed and more properties are compared.</s><s>We also studied the evolution of the chaperonin system in mollicutes and re-examined whether the loss of a GroEL homolog occurred monophyletically <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or polyphyletically <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Our findings support the latter view.</s></p></div>
