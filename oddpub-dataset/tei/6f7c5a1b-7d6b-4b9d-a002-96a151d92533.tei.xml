<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Kaliopenic nephropathy seems largely to have disappeared.</s><s>Bock et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> described 23 chronically hypokalaemic patients, 21 women, that they followed up for &gt;6 years (not quite) 40 years ago.</s><s>The causes of hypokalaemia were malnutrition, laxative abuse, self-administered diuretic usage or a combination of these factors.</s><s>The authors biopsied nine patients and found interstitial nephritis and tubular vacuolization.</s><s>Gradually over time, renal function deteriorated in many of these patients; they progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD).</s><s>Since they were seldom convinced to alter their behaviours, the authors favoured a diagnosis of chronic kaliopenic nephropathy.</s><s>A similar condition was described in cats; in the felines, dietary rather than behavioural or drug-related problems were more prominent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>A recent patient caused us to revisit this syndrome.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The case</head><p><s>A 58-year-old woman was referred to us because of weakness and chronic generalized pain 'all over'.</s><s>She lived in a wealthy Middle Eastern country.</s><s>She claimed chronic weight loss over the past 2 years that she could not explain.</s><s>Her physician had prescribed methotrexate for 'rheumatoid factor-negative' rheumatoid arthritis; however, we could not identify any clinical correlates of this condition.</s><s>With additional questioning, she admitted to having ingested laxatives (currently bisacodyl) for years because of 'bloating', abdominal distension and various discomforts.</s><s>She chronically ingested acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain, but denied diuretic ingestion.</s><s>As far as we could discern, she had practically stopped eating altogether.</s><s>On examination, she appeared in Western dress.</s><s>The blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, heart rate 76 bpm, she was afebrile, weighed 44 kg and had a body mass index (weight kg/height m 2 ) of 17.2.</s><s>She had no evidence of rheumatoid arthritis or any other chronic medical condition aside from cachexia on physical examination.</s><s>She had no oedema.</s></p><p><s>Routine laboratory and imaging workup revealed haemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL and haematocrit 25 vol%; the anaemia was normochromic, normocytic (MCV 86 fL, MCH 29.6 pg and MCHC 34.4 g/dL).</s><s>She had normal platelets (326 Gpt/L) and normal leucocytes (6.4 Gpt/L).</s></p><p><s>The sodium was 138, potassium 2.9, calcium 2.4 and phosphate 0.4 (all mmol/L).</s><s>The creatinine was 157 µmol/L.</s><s>We used cystatin C to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 15 mol/min.</s><s>The 25-OH vitamin D3 was 9.6 µg/L (normal &gt;30 µg/L) and 1,25-OH vitamin D3 was 11.0 ng/L (normal 25-60 ng/L).</s><s>The parathyroid hormone concentration was 1.68 pmol/L (normal 1.6-6.9</s><s>pmol/L).</s><s>Bone alkaline phosphatase was 62.4 µg/L, which is high, (upper limit of the norm, 24.4 µg/l).</s><s>Urinalysis showed some white and red blood cells, but no remarkable elements.</s><s>The protein:creatinine ratio was 436 mg/g, while the albumin:creatinine ratio was 26 mg/g (slightly elevated).</s><s>A capillary blood sample revealed a pH of 7.29, PaCO 2 31, PaO 2 75 (both mmHg) and bicarbonate 14 mmol/L.</s><s>Various antibody tests for chronic systemic illnesses were negative.</s><s>We collected urine for 24 h.</s><s>Here, the sodium excretion was 48, potassium 14.4 and phosphate 0.7 (all mmol/L).</s><s>Ultrasound studies were normal and the gastroscopy showed signs of oesophageal candidiasis.</s><s>Our gastroenterologist consultant performed a requested colonoscopy.</s><s>He had not been forewarned but nonetheless thought that the colon showed signs of pseudomelanosis coli and performed a biopsy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ).</s><s>The specimen confirmed the presence of lipofuscin-laden macrophages.</s></p><p><s>Since the patient had estimated GFR (eGFR) of 15 mL/min, we performed a renal biopsy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The glomeruli were normal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Interstitial oedema and round-cell infiltrates were present (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Tubules were filled with hyalinaceous casts.</s><s>Small vessel fibrosis was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>However, the invariable and striking feature was vacuolization of the renal tubular epithelium that could be observed in almost every section in both proximal and distal renal tubular epithelium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>We also performed a bone biopsy that disclosed a picture consistent with vitamin D deficiency, namely osteomalacia, and osteoporosis (not shown).</s><s>We tested for renal tubular acidosis and found that our patient could acidify her urine normally.</s><s>We did not specifically test her urinary concentrating ability.</s></p><p><s>Our treatment programme was dietetic-'we fed her'.</s><s>She appeared to cooperate and did not develop symptoms of refeeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The patient resided in a private, luxurious ward and all her wishes were answered.</s><s>She was pleasant and gracious towards all clinical questions, although the answers did not invariably satisfy clinical nosiness.</s><s>Finally, we could not discern how she dressed in her home environment since this state of affairs could clearly have influenced her bone metabolism.</s><s>Over the ensuing month that she stayed with us, the hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia and even the metabolic acidosis went away.</s><s>We stopped the methotrexate.</s><s>We never found a specific 'cause' of our patient's problems.</s><s>However, under close observation, careful control of surreptitious medications and hospital food, the clinical picture reverted to normal and she gained 7 kg in weight.</s><s>She travelled back to her country of origin with avuncular advice from us, but with a guarded prognosis nonetheless.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We concluded that laxative abuse and self-imposed malnutrition lay at the heart of our patient's problems.</s><s>Virchow is responsible for the misnomer, melanosis coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The colonic pigmentation is triggered by deposits of apoptotic cells, which are ingested by adjacent macrophages within the epithelial tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Those macrophages migrate in the lamina propria, where lysosomes convert the remains of the cells into lipofuscin pigment.</s><s>Thus, the term 'melanosis' is misleading, since the pigment is not melanin.</s><s>We used the term 'pseudomelanosis' here.</s><s>In addition to its association with anthraquinones, pseudomelanosis coli may appear during long-term bisacodyl administration.</s></p><p><s>Our patient did not have classic manifestations of anorexia nervosa, although similar to those patients, her condition was self-inflicted.</s><s>Anorexia nervosa can affect the kidney in numerous ways, including increased rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD, electrolyte abnormalities and nephrolithiasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In anorexia nervosa, there are limitations of serum creatinine level in estimating kidney function, which caused us to rely on cystatin C estimates.</s><s>Furthermore, the psychosocial challenges inherent with treating systemic manifestations of psychiatric conditions in anorexia nervosa patients are well appreciated.</s><s>We expect that those in our patient will be little different.</s></p><p><s>We could identify no renal disease that could explain our patient's symptom constellation, although she clearly had one.</s><s>An eGFR of 15 mL/min has no trivial connotations.</s><s>She had interstitial renal disease that could have various explanations.</s><s>However, the dominant histological finding was the intense vacuolarization of the renal tubular epithelium.</s><s>Renal tubular vacuoles are nothing new.</s><s>We were interested to review the report by Jaffé and Sternberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, who, to our knowledge, were the first to describe vacuolarization in renal tubular cells after hypokalaemia.</s><s>Clinicians at that time could not measure potassium.</s><s>However, they were aware of diarrhoea.</s><s>Renal biopsies were not done then, so the authors relied on autopsies performed on chronic diarrhoea victims.</s><s>The disease conditions in their patients lasted between 6 and 21 weeks.</s><s>The histology shown in their paper, also with haematoxylin and eosin staining, is very similar to the sections we display here.</s><s>The authors concluded that vacuolar degeneration of renal epithelium could represent an important avenue for investigating renal diseases in general.</s><s>After all, fatty, hyaline droplets, amyloid degenerations, cloudy swelling, etc. appear in all CKD-related processes.</s></p><p><s>Riemenschneider and Bohle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> also investigated renal morphology in patients with kaliopenic nephropathy.</s><s>They reviewed renal biopsies from 40 patients with hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia of an average of 10-years duration due to laxative or diuretic abuse, anorexia nervosa or chronic vomiting.</s><s>Light microscopy revealed juxtaglomerular cells that were sometimes enormously enlarged.</s><s>In their series, the proximal and distal tubules contained non-specific vacuoles in only 8 of 40 biopsy specimens.</s><s>In 75% of the cases, the interstitial surface area was increased with predominantly focal lymphocytic cellular infiltration.</s><s>Interstitial fibrosis was pronounced in emaciated patients.</s><s>The pathological changes of kaliopenic nephropathy have been modelled in rats.</s><s>Sarkar and Levine <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> found that the renal tubular epithelial cells showed electron-lucent vacuoles, lysosomelike dense bodies, focal cytoplasmic degradation and dilated</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C L I N I C A L K I D N E Y J O U R N A L</formula><p><s>intercellular spaces in many proximal tubules.</s><s>They also described medullary cell droplets with sequestration of cytoplasmic components.</s></p><p><s>Recently, Reungjui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> drew attention to the fact that hypokalaemic nephropathy is associated with angiogenesis.</s><s>They found that Sprague Dawley rats fed low-potassium diets developed peritubular capillary loss.</s><s>These changes were associated with increased macrophage infiltration, increased expression of both monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha and a loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase.</s><s>Renal markers of oxidative stress were increased late in the disease.</s><s>The authors concluded that hypokalaemic nephropathy is associated with impaired renal angiogenesis, evidenced by progressive capillary loss, reduced endothelial cell proliferation and loss of VEGF expression.</s><s>These mechanisms could clearly have played a role in our patient.</s></p><p><s>Kaliopenic nephropathy could have additional consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Resistance to vasopressin has been described by increased prostaglandin production that inhibits adenylate cyclase production in response to vasopressin.</s><s>In addition to the droplet accumulation, hyperplastic epithelial cells are a feature that could contribute to cyst formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Torres et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> reported on the occurrence of reversible, medullary renal cysts in patients with chronic potassium depletion.</s><s>We could identify no such cysts in our patient.</s></p><p><s>Potassium homeostasis has recently been extensively reviewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>A case example from that review concerns a patient with Gitelman's syndrome, a genetic cause for chronic hypokalaemia that should engender kaliopenic nephropathy.</s><s>Interestingly, we found few examples of Gitelman's syndrome and hypokalaemic nephropathy.</s><s>A renal biopsy from an isolated case with renal insufficiency disclosed severe interstitial nephritis, but without the prominent droplet lesions exhibited by our patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In this condition, total body magnesium depletion may also contribute to nephropathy.</s></p><p><s>Twenty-four hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion is used to assess intake of these electrolytes.</s><s>Conceivably, a highsodium intake and a low potassium intake, perhaps by hypokalaemia-related renal injury, could influence the course of chronic renal disease.</s><s>Investigators prospectively studied the association of urinary sodium and potassium excretion with CKD progression and all-cause mortality among 3939 patients with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study.</s><s>Urinary sodium and potassium excretion was measured using three 24-h urine specimens, and CKD progression was defined as incident endstage renal disease or halving of eGFR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>True to the prediction, the highest quartile of sodium excretion had a relative risk for progression of 1.54.</s><s>However, similar results were obtained for the quartiles of potassium excretion.</s><s>The finding that high urinary potassium excretion was significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of CKD progression was unexpected and remains inadequately explained.</s></p><p><s>An additional issue could be that total body potassium depletion and hypokalaemia could increase the risk of AKI.</s><s>In isolated case reports, clinicians have postulated a contributory role of hypokalaemia involved in the pathophysiology of renal ischaemia-induced AKI, although mechanisms have not been provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Here, animal models could be elucidating.</s></p><p><s>We were surprised that little has been learned mechanistically about hypokalaemia and the increased risk of CKD.</s><s>Since cats seem particularly subject to CKD when they develop hypokalaemia, perhaps they could become an appropriate animal model.</s><s>Dow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> found that within a group of 186 hypokalaemic cats, high serum urea nitrogen concentrations, hyperchloraemia and high serum creatinine concentrations were the most common biochemical abnormalities.</s><s>When disease diagnosis was compared among cats with severe hypokalaemia (serum potassium concentration &lt;3.0 mmol/L) and those with moderate hypokalaemia, cats with severe hypokalaemia were 3.5 times more likely to have CKD than cats with less severe hypokalaemia.</s><s>Unfortunately, the authors could provide no biopsy data.</s></p><p><s>Despite the fact that the term kaliopenic nephropathy has disappeared from the literature in the last 20 years, we believe the condition still exists.</s><s>Perhaps we are dealing with a semantic definition.</s><s>The term hypokalaemic nephropathy with CKD is found more often.</s><s>A hypokalaemic patient with an aldosterone-producing tumour was reported, but that patient exhibited tubulointerstitial injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, eating and laxative disorders as exhibited by our patient remain important in the pathogenesis of chronic renal disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
