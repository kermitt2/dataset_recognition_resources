<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Spatio-temporal formation of fibronectin fibres follows actin organization</head><p><s>The spatio-temporal organization of fibronectin within the de novo assembled ECM was assessed by adding trace amounts of fibronectin labelled with different fluorophores (either yellow or red) at two time points for 1 day each using well-established protocols <ref type="bibr">[12,48 -50]</ref>, and by observing how cells incorporate it into their own ECM (see Material and methods).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the evolution of the actin and the fibronectin networks observed in tissues fixed after different durations of culture.</s><s>It was verified that the presence of labelled fibronectin did not significantly affect the kinetics of tissue deposition (electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>First, newly growing tissue was exposed to yellow-labelled fibronectin between days 4 and 5 and directly fixed for actin immunostaining at the end of exposure on day 5.</s><s>The actin as well as the Fn-546 signal intensity was highest at the tissue-medium interface (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Although the fibronectin fibres were not as highly organized as the actin stress-fibres, there is a general coalignment.</s><s>Second, to explore how deposited fibronectin matrix evolves as the tissue is growing, the cells were then cultured for six additional days in standard culture medium without labelled fibronectin in solution.</s><s>When fixed at day 10, the cells had completely overgrown the labelled fibronectin matrix integrated between days 4 and 6.</s><s>As a consequence, very little signal could be observed close to the tissuemedium interface, and the brighter yellow fibronectin signal no longer follows the actin ring.</s></p><p><s>Third, to investigate the deposition of new relative to existing matrix, some samples received additional redlabelled fibronectin after 11 days of regular culture.</s><s>In the scaffold fixed 1 day later (on day 12), the labelled fibronectin has been incorporated into fibres throughout the tissue, although the fluorescent signal was slightly higher along the tissue-medium interface.</s><s>Further samples were fixed and imaged after days 17, 28 and 35 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>In all of these pores, the two fibronectin layers could still be seen distinctly, although the strong actin signal indicating the tissue-medium interface moved closer to the centre of the pore with growth.</s></p><p><s>To analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of the actin and fibronectin networks, we measured intensity profiles from the centre of the pore to the edge of the scaffold for each channel and each time point (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>In every sample, the maximum intensity of the actin signal was closest to the centre of the pore and corresponds to the actin ring along the tissue-medium interface.</s><s>The signal of the first fibronectin added to the medium (yellow) at day 4 initially coincided with the actin peak on the first day after addition, and had moved only slightly towards the centre of the pore at day 11, but not as far as the actin ring.</s><s>This indicates that the ECM deposited at an earlier time point does not move together with the tissue-medium interface.</s><s>The signal from the second labelled fibronectin added at day 11 (red) followed the same trend, but is shifted in time and space owing to its later incorporation.</s><s>Together, these findings show that new tissue is deposited layer-by-layer along the tissue-medium interface as cells continue to assemble new fibronectin fibrils on top of the existing tissue.</s></p><p><s>To measure the degree of fibre alignment between the incorporated fibronectin and the actin, we performed a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the different confocal images.</s><s>The degree of fibre alignment was then measured by the local difference in orientation angles (Dq) between the two images.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows two example orientation analyses for tissues fixed at day 12 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-e</ref>) and day 28 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f -j</ref> ). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,f shows the confocal images of tissues stained for actin.</s><s>The differences in matrix fibre orientation with respect to the local actin orientation are shown for Fn546 (b,g), Fn633 (c,h) and collagen (see §2.4) (d,i) as well as their associated histograms (e,j ).</s><s>For a full set of histograms of all samples measured in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, see electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>.</s><s>An average degree of orientation can be calculated by simply taking the average cosine of the local difference in orientation angles (Dq).</s><s>Perfect alignment between F-actin and ECM fibres is represented by a value of 1, randomly aligned fibres will have a value of 0.626.</s><s>Electronic supplementary material, table <ref type="table">S1</ref> shows orientation parameters for all samples, and highlights that ECM components become aligned with the local orientation of the actin stress fibres, although for later time points, the data indicate a lower actin -collagen alignment.</s><s>This might be partially owing to the lower actin signal obtained from imaging thick tissues.</s></p></div>
