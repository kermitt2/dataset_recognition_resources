target="#b2">(Brown, 2002)</ref>, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Recognition of these genomic signals and regions (GSRs) helps in understanding genome organization, gene regulation, and functions.</s><s>Additionally, the translation of that knowledge into systems-based applications, combined with genome variations, allows for the association of genes to diseases and facilitates molecular-based medical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dougherty et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, the diverse models proposed for the recognition of specific types of GSRs for different organisms with manually-crafted features bring questions regarding the strengths, weaknesses, and differences of these models.</s><s>Moreover, different types of GSRs require different sets of features for building efficient recognition models.</s><s>However, the presence of many types of GSRs in the genomic DNA and the lack of a unified approach to accurately predict them by computational means, make the GSR prediction a challenging problem.</s><s>Although a considerable number of computational approaches have been published in the past, there is still no available standard procedure or generalized model structure that can be used for the prediction of different types of GSR in various organisms.</s></p><p><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sharan and Myers (2005)</ref> attempted to derive a generalized method to detect signals and their recurrent motifs using a support vector machine for classification.</s><s>The method is based on probabilistic models for discriminative motifs and their spatial combination.</s><s>The authors applied their approach for the recognition of core promoters, alternatively spliced exons, and cellcycle regulated genes and achieved results comparable to other methods.</s></p><p><s>The prediction of selected GSRs has been addressed separately in previous studies using traditional machine learning techniques, for example <ref type="bibr">(Bajic et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Choudhuri, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jia, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prohaska et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sonnenburg et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, gene finding tools implement a set of specialized statistical features to identify different GSRs, such as, introns, coding exons, 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burge, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hoff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Parra et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Reese et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schiex et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stanke et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, the development of many such tools may require a tremendous amount of work.</s><s>Therefore, an unbiased and generalizable method for the accurate identification of different GSRs would facilitate the development of more accurate gene finding tools and would enable large-scale analyses of different organisms with significantly smaller development efforts.</s><s>Recently, deep-learning (DL) techniques have been shown to achieve outstanding results in many cases without the need for manuallycrafted features <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(LeCun et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>As a result, there is a growing number of studies proposing the use of DL techniques with DNA sequences to tackle various computational biology problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Khurana et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Magana-Mora and Bajic, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr"

classification and exploits spatial correlation/dependencies in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Zuo et al., 2015)</ref> and has been applied for the prediction of different GSRs.</s><s>For example, the CNNProm method <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Umarov and Solovyev, 2017)</ref> for promoter prediction uses a singledimension CNN to predict promoter regions.</s><s>The authors derived an independent CNN with customized parameters for each of the five considered organisms and achieved promising results.</s><s>Alipanahi and colleagues <ref type="bibr">(Alipanahi et al., 2015)</ref> proposed the DeepBind method based on a CNN to predict DNA and RNA sequence specif-icities of the DNA and RNA-binding proteins, as well as for the discovery of new patterns in the sequence.</s><s>Similarly, another study on the same problem was discussed by Zeng and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zeng et al., 2016)</ref> achieving comparable results to the study of DNA sequence binding using a large transcription factors dataset.</s><s>Later, Zhang and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref> proposed TITER, a DL framework for the prediction of both canonical and non-canonical start codons.</s><s>TITER framework is based on QTI-seq data, which captures real-time translation initiation events qualitatively and quantitatively.</s><s>The TITER framework has two approaches for the prediction of translation initiation sites (TIS): one with a prior preference of a TIS codon and the other without such information.</s><s>Additionally, CNNs have also been applied for the prediction of non-coding functions.</s><s>In this direction, DeepSEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zhou and Troyanskaya, 2015)</ref>, based on a CNN, predicts the functional effects of the non-coding variants from large-scale chromatin-profiling data.</s><s>Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Quang and Xie (2016)</ref>, developed the DanQ framework, which uses a combination of a CNN and a recurrent neural network for predicting the function of non-coding genes directly from the sequence.</s><s>Finally, Singh and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Singh et al., 2016)</ref> proposed DeepChrome, the first DL framework for gene expression classification using histone modification data, which outperformed the conventional state-of-the-art methods on 56 different cell types.</s><s>More applications of DL to problems in bioinformatics and computational biology are reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Min et al. (2016)</ref>.</s><s>Even though the previously mentioned studies based on DL models aim at generating data features directly from the sequence, they remain confined to specific tasks and, in many cases, they are tested on a single organism.</s></p><p><s>Here, we propose a novel DL structure, DeepGSR, for the recognition of different types of GSRs in genomic DNA and explore its potential for the accurate prediction of two such signals.</s><s>The DL architecture relies on the proper data representation of the GSRs, their genomic neighborhoods, and utilization of the spatial correlation.</s><s>We evaluated the efficiency of our framework on two types of GSRs, namely, polyadenylation signals (PAS) and TIS signals, in four organisms: Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Bos taurus (bovine) and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly).</s><s>We conducted genome-wide experiments to assess the performance of DeepGSR using 1) specific models for each organism independently, and 2) cross-organism model testing (i.e., model is developed using data from one organism, and tested on genomic data of different organisms not used for model training).</s><s>The results demonstrated that DeepGSR outperforms the start-of-the-art results in recognition of both PAS and TIS in the human genome.</s><s>As such, DeepGSR reduced the classification error rate by more than 29% and 86% for PAS and TIS prediction in human, respectively, and produced an acceptable performance for both genome-wide and cross-organisms</s></p></div>
