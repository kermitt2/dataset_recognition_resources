<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Th17-promoting cytokines are sufficient to induce RORC2, CCR6, and IL-23R in uncommitted T cells</head><p><s>To understand why uncommitted naive T cells failed to produce IL-17 in standard Th17 cultures, we first analyzed STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation, which have, respectively, permissive and inhibitory effects on Th17 differentiation.</s><s>Th17-promoting cytokines induced STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) as expected.</s><s>Moreover, Th17promoting cytokines induced m-RNA of RORC2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), the lineage-defining transcription factor of Th17 cells.</s><s>We next analyzed induction of CCR6 and IL-23R, two characteristic membrane proteins of Th17 cells, in uncommitted naive T cells in response to different combinations of Th17-promoting cyto- kines.</s><s>CCR6 surface expression was induced on uncommitted T cells in response to Th17-promoting cytokines, and its expression was highest when all four Th17-promoting cytokines were added together (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>IL-23R expression was analyzed at the single-cell level by IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.</s><s>IL-23 responsiveness was efficiently induced by Th17-promoting cytokines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>), and again the combination of all four cytokines was most efficient.</s></p><p><s>In summary, Th17-promoting cytokines induce a partial commitment of naive T cells to the Th17 lineage, as evidenced by the induction of Th17-associated genes like CCR6, IL-23R, and RORC2, but are insufficient to induce IL-17, the hallmark of Th17 cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IL-17 production by uncommitted T cells requires prolonged TCR stimulation in low-density cultures</head><p><s>T cell differentiation critically depends on the strength and duration of TCR signaling.</s><s>We therefore wondered if optimizing signal strength might lead to IL-17 induction in uncommitted T cells and therefore varied the time of TCR stimulation, the concentration of the stimulating anti-CD3 Abs, and the cell density, which has an impact on the competition for cytokines or nutrients.</s><s>In these experiments, we were able to induce robust IL-17 production in uncommitted naive T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>), but exclusively in lowdensity cultures (10-or 100-fold dilution) and upon sustained TCR stimulation.</s><s>Similar results were obtained with uncommitted naive T cells from peripheral blood of adults and cord blood, and in naive T cell preparations in which CD161-and CXCR3expressing cells had also been depleted (data not shown).</s><s>Importantly, in our high-density condition, cells were plated at 2.5 3 10 5 cells per milliliter, that is, at the same or even at a lower concentration, as used by several previous seminal studies analyzing human Th17 differentiation [i.e., 2.5 3 10 5 2 1 3 10 6 cells per milliliter <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>].</s><s>Therefore, we will refer to this condition as "standard high-density culture" for the rest of this article.</s></p><p><s>Conflicting results on the cytokines and, in particular, on TGF-b in human Th17 cell differentiation were published <ref type="bibr">(5-8, 10, 11)</ref>.</s><s>A possible explanation is that uncommitted and precommitted T cells, which are both present at variable frequencies in standard preparations of bona fide naive human T cells, might have different cytokine requirements.</s><s>We found that the combination of TGF-b1, IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-23 was most efficient for the induction of IL-17, CCR6, and IL-23 responsiveness in uncommitted T cells, but we also detected Th17 commitment in the absence of TGF-b (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Of interest, high NaCl concentrations, which were reported to enhance cytokine-driven Th17 differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, poorly induced IL-17 in standard cultures but strongly boosted IL-17 production in low-density cultures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The striking effect of sustained TCR stimulation and cell density on cytokine production was not restricted to IL-17.</s><s>In standard cultures under neutral conditions, that is, in the absence of exogenous cytokines but in the presence of neutralizing Abs to IL-4, IFN-g, and IL-12, production of IFN-g and IL-22 were, as expected, low and hardly detectable, respectively.</s><s>IFN-g and IL-22 production increased dramatically, however, upon sustained TCR stimulation in low-density cultures in the complete absence of exogenous cytokines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>Notably, not all cytokines were similarly affected by cell density, as IL-21 production showed only a moderate and inconsistent increase in low-density cultures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>Although IL-22 production was efficiently induced in low-density cultures in the absence of exogenous cytokines, it was strongly modulated by the cytokine environment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, similar to IL-17 it was enhanced by IL-6 and inhibited by IL-4 or IL-12, but in contrast to IL-17, it was inhibited by TGF-b (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, the optimal combination of cytokines to induce IL-17 strongly inhibited IL-22 production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>IL-17 and IL-22 differed not only for their requirements for cytokines but also for the density of TCR agonists, as IL-17 induction was more efficient at low concentrations of anti-CD3 Abs, whereas the opposite was true for IL-22 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>) and IFN-g (data not shown).</s><s>Importantly, a fundamental difference between the regulation of IL-22 and IFN-g production was, however, that IL-6-induced IL-22 production was hardly detectable (,0.5% IL-22 +
