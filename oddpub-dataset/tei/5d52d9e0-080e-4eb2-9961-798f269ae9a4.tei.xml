[20], TransEnterix, Inc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, and Meere Company, Inc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, but also efforts by Intuitive Surgical Inc. to lower prices are desirable to reduce cost from an administrative point of view.</s></p><p><s>For GC, robotic procedures have been developed according to procedures in the conventional LG, which has been more commonly performed.</s><s>Thus, the impact of the use of the DVSS for GC treatment has been assessed mostly in comparison with LG <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Most previous reports have failed to demonstrate clear clinical advantages of RG over LG <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref>.</s><s>However, the benefits of RG for reducing morbidity, including POPF, were identified in the present multi-institution prospective study, as well as in a previous single-institution retrospective study performed in Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>.</s><s>This may be at least partly because common technical principles for robotic set-up and dissection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> were used across the institutions.</s><s>In fact, following the death of a patient soon after RG, the Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery took the initiative to safely introduce robotic surgery nationwide according to the "proposal on the introduction of robotic surgery" issued in July 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In accordance with this proposal, I.U., as a proctor, made the best efforts to mentor the potential collaborating surgeons in this study for their initial few cases.</s><s>Another possible reason may be the strict requirements for participating institutions and operating surgeons.</s><s>In particular, operating surgeons were included if they had performed ≥ 10 RG procedures, including ≥ 1 total gastrectomies, and institutions were included if they had managed ≥ 20 RG procedures, including ≥ 5 total gastrectomies, considering the learning curve of RG for experienced laparoscopic gastric surgeons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, since April 2018, RG with health insurance coverage has been performed by the qualified surgeons (Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery) according to the endoscopic surgical skill qualification system who had previously performed ≥ 10 RG procedures in institutions that managed ≥ 50 gastrectomies, including ≥ 20 LG or RG procedures annually.</s></p><p><s>The present study had several limitations.</s><s>First, this study was conducted as a single-arm study.</s><s>A historical control was used to assess the statistical hypothesis.</s><s>In this study, blood loss and duration of stay improved when compared to the findings in the historical control; however, some parts of the patient background significantly differed.</s><s>Therefore, there might have been data bias, and the overall results should be interpreted with caution.</s><s>We decided to use such a study design instead of a randomized-controlled trial mainly because of our limited budget.</s><s>Randomization was technically difficult, as each patient who underwent RG needed to pay approximately 700,000 JPY, even when using the "Senshiniryo" B system in combination with the reimbursement of 500,000 JPY from Intuitive Surgical, Inc., whereas the use of LG involved a cost of only approximately 100,000 JPY per patient.</s><s>In fact, according to the results of the subanalyses, considerable differences in the patient background were observed.</s><s>We plan to perform propensity score-matched analyses once the long-term outcomes are obtained in the prospective cohort of this study.</s><s>Second, the quality of the historical control may be a concern.</s><s>While the design of this study was considered, MHLW requested a historical control with higher level of evidence.</s><s>However, no multi-institutional large randomized-controlled trial on LG for advanced GC has been completed worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</s><s>The Nationwide Survey of Endoscopic Surgery in Japan biennially conducted by the Japan Society of Endoscopic Surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> could not be used, because all types of postoperative complications were not registered and severity of those was not graded.</s><s>National Clinical Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> was also lined up as a candidate, but it had been just a little, while since registration had started.</s><s>Thus, after a long discussion, MHLW finally allowed us to use short-and long-term (3-year) outcomes from historical controls in the three leading institutions (Fujita Health University, Saga University, and Kyoto University) between 2009 and 2012, although the data were unpublished.</s><s>As a matter of fact, the morbidity rate (C-D Grade ≥ IIIa) in patients with cStage I disease who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+ lymph-node dissection was only 4.7% in the historical control, which was less than the rate of 5.1% noted in the Japan Clinical Oncology Group 0703 trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, suggesting excellent quality with regard to LG.</s><s>Third, as GC is commonly found in Korea and Japan, where population-based screening is being undertaken <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>, more reports, predominantly on the early GC, are being published in these countries than in Western countries.</s><s>Most of the patients in this study had cStage I disease.</s><s>It may be challenging to extend the present findings to the Western population.</s><s>As our previous study suggested that larger extents of gastric resection and lymph-node dissection are associated with more effective use of the robot <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a multi-institutional prospective study with a considerable number of patients with advanced GC is warranted.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, RG reduced the morbidity rate when compared to the findings with LG.</s><s>RG might be safe, feasible, and effective for GC.</s><s>Medical insurance coverage in combination with a reduction in the cost of the robotic system would accelerate the spread of robotic surgery in Japan.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Complication of C-D grade IVa was seen in 1 (0.3%) patient (intra-abdominal bleeding).</s><s>No C-D grade IVb complication or 30-day mortality was noted.</s><s>One of the ten patients, who were preoperatively scheduled to undergo distal gastrectomy but actually underwent total gastrectomy, developed C-D grade I complication (constipation, classified as Local-Others in Table</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
