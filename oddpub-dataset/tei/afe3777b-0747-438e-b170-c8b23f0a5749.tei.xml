<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We developed an in-house exposure questionnaire for the use in JECS since there were no standardized ones available.</s><s>Almost two identical questionnaires were administered during pregnancy.</s><s>The exposure data included dwelling conditions, indoor environment, daily life consumer product uses, and occupation.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first of its kind in Japan to characterize over 100,000 pregnant women's exposure data by the questionnaire.</s><s>The mean gestational age (SD) at the time of the MT1 questionnaire responses was 16.4 (8.0), which means about half of the participants responded the MT1 questionnaire during the second-trimester period of pregnancy or later.</s><s>We intended to recruit the participants in early pregnancy but did not restrict to be in the first trimester.</s><s>Some of the participants were registered at their mid to late pregnancy.</s><s>When we exclude the responses from the mothers who responded during their gestational ages greater than 16 weeks from the MT1 questionnaire data analysis, the results were similar to those presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (data not shown).</s><s>The timing of the questionnaire response must be taken into account when researchers use the MT1 questionnaire data for later analysis.</s></p><p><s>Most of the participants had little occupational exposure to chemicals during pregnancy, while 30-40% of the participants reported the use of personal care products and household pesticide application.</s><s>Of the participants, 20-30% had consumed convenience foods such as fast foods and retort pouch foods more than once a week within the month prior to the survey, suggesting exposure to chemicals in preservatives or food-packaging materials such as phthalates and bisphenols.</s><s>Phthalates and bisphenols are suspected endocrine disrupters and have been adversely associated with child health.</s><s>This information can be used not only to analyze the association between environmental factors and children's health but also in the future planning of the JECS exposure assessment using biomonitoring.</s></p><p><s>The Danish National Birth Cohort reported that heavy object lifting was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth in a dose-response manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Although no exposure-response relationship was observed for fetal death, Mocevic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> found an increased risk of stillbirth (fetal death ≥ 22 gestational weeks) among those who lifted more than 200 kg/day.</s><s>In the Danish National Birth Cohort, 16,604 women (26.4%) carried  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), though most women in JECS lifted loads greater than 10 kg (including a child) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Various case-control studies have shown the relationship between maternal occupational exposure to solvents and some subtypes of malformations, mostly oral clefts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Significant associations were also reported between maternal exposure to solvents and cardiac malformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and neural tube defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>A review of the results of 49 studies showed that maternal occupational exposure to chemicals (lead and pesticides) was associated with time to pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Snijder et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> observed in the Netherlands (the Generation R Study) that maternal occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, alkylphenolic compounds, and pesticides influenced adversely several domains of fetal growth (fetal weight).</s><s>In JECS, the occupational use of insecticides, organic solvents, and metals (sum of chromium, arsenic and cadmium, lead, and mercury) more than once a month was reported by 7.1%, 5.8%, and 0.6% of the participants, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>These frequencies were slightly higher than those in the Generation R Study (n = 4680) in which the prevalence of maternal occupational use of pesticides, organic solvents, and metals were 0.5%, 4.7%, and 1.1%,   respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>With the exception of mercury, occupational exposure to these chemicals was more prevalent in the JECS participants than in the Generation R participants.</s></p><p><s>Though exposure information obtained from questionnaires could be considered also an important variable, there are few validated standard questionnaire sets.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the kappa-coefficients demonstrate mostly fair to moderate agreement between the MT1 and MT2 questionnaires.</s><s>Since all kappa scores resulted in &lt; 0.61, it suggested that pregnant women could change the chemical use under occupation during pregnancy.</s></p><p><s>The National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> reported that the frequency of eating out at a restaurant was 25.1% in total women, 47.3% in women 20-29 years old, and 40.4% in women 30-39 years old.</s><s>The survey reported also that the frequency of eating pre-packed foods was 39.4% in total women more than 20 years old.</s><s>In JECS, the frequencies of eating out and eating pre-packed foods more than once a week were 45.7% and 37.6%, respectively.</s><s>This result is similar to that of the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan, indicating that this part of the questionnaire is valid also.</s></p><p><s>The 2013 Housing and Land Survey of Japan reported that the proportions of wooden housing and non-wooden, such as steel-frame, housing were 58% and 42%, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The JECS results were similar to those of that survey with wooden and non-wooden dwellings reported by 54% and 45% of participants, respectively.</s><s>In 1981, the Building Standards Act of Japan was revised to enforce new earthquake-resistance standards.</s><s>The proportion of housing built after 1981 was 64.9% in the national survey (2013), while that of housing less than 20 years of age was 64.8% in JECS.</s><s>The mean number of rooms and dwelling area in the national survey (2013) were 4.59 rooms and 94.42 m 2 per house, respectively.</s><s>The mean number of rooms and dwelling area in JECS were 3.89 rooms and 82.32 m 2 per house, respectively.</s><s>These results showed that the JECS participants lived in smaller and relatively newer houses compared with respondents to the national survey (2013).</s></p><p><s>In the questionnaire-based maternal environmental exposure assessment (n = 987) of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project, the rate of household pesticide application was 7.1% (70/987) in respondents from Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, UK, and the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In JECS, the rates of maternal use of moth repellent for clothes, indoor insecticide spray, mosquito coils/mats, liquid insecticides, smoke insecticides, and herbicides were 59%, 32%, 32%, 0.7%, 6.7%, and 8.8%, respectively.</s><s>People in Japan appear to use more types of pesticides and to use them at a higher rate than people in the abovementioned countries.</s><s>This indicates the importance of biomonitoring of pesticide chemicals in JECS.</s></p><p><s>There are some limitations of the JECS exposure assessment questionnaires.</s><s>Firstly, the self-administered questionnaires were developed in-house by the JECS Programme Office and did not go through any validation process using biological or environmental measurements.</s><s>Much of the exposure data could only be obtained using questionnaires; the accuracy and reliability of which could not be evaluated.</s><s>However, some of our results were similar to those of national surveys on such topics as dwelling conditions and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>knowledge, therefore, these results constitute the first report on the exposure status of pregnant women in Japan.</s><s>Secondly, we investigated the two questionnaires reliability by administering nearly identical questionnaires in MT1 and MT2.</s><s>However, there were subtle differences in how the questions were expressed in the MT1 and MT2 questionnaires (for details see Additional file 1), which may have affected the responses.</s><s>In a future study, we plan to verify the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible using quantitative instruments such as biomonitoring and environmental measurements.</s><s>Lastly, there were some extreme values observed among the questionnaire responses, e.g., 99 years for the "number of years living in the current place of residence," 91/83 as "the floor living on/number of floors in the apartment building," 93 for the "number of rooms in the house/apartment," and 999 m 2 for the "size of the floor space of the house/apartment."</s><s>Such values were observed in less than 0.01% of cases.</s><s>We did not exclude these possible outliers from the analysis presented in this paper since there was no way for us to verify the accuracy of these responses.</s></p><p><s>This result will be used to design future JECS exposure assessments with biomonitoring.</s><s>The questionnaire data will also be used to investigate the associations between environmental factors and children's health and development when data comes available.</s><s>Some parts of the questionnaire will be validated using biomonitoring data.</s><s>Such questionnaire items are of great importance for other epidemiological and exposure studies since there are few validated exposure questionnaires.</s><s>The validate questionnaire can also be used for a national biomonitoring program as a tool to collect exposure source information.</s></p></div>
