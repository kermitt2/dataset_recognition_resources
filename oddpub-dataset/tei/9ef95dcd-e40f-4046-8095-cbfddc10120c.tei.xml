<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>One of the typical aspects of the ageing process is the development of a low grade inflammatory status called "inflammageing" which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the main agerelated chronic diseases as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, sarcopenia and cancer [1e3].</s></p><p><s>This inflammatory status includes a profound modification within the cytokine network leading to a general increase in plasma levels and cell capability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines with a subsequent increase of the main inflammatory markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Inflammageing is the result of a dynamic signaling produced by different organs and tissues.</s><s>In particular, adipose tissue has been recognized as an active endocrine organ able to regulate physiological and pathological processes, such as immunity and inflammation, through the production of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory factors, including cytokines (Interleukin-6, IL-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, TNF-a), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin and resistin), and chemokines.</s><s>The aging process is physiologically associated with a lean body mass loss leading to an increase in fat mass percentage on body weight, specifically in the abdominal region <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, anti-inflammatory strategies may be useful to prevent or delay ageing and the onset of agerelated diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The excessive intake of energy and nutrients together with the kind of nutrients consumed may turn on inflammatory pathways, directly or indirectly, through different mechanisms such as the induction of obesity and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</s><s>In particular, dietary fatty acids may affect inflammatory processes notably through modulation of the metabolism of eicosanoids and of the expression of inflammatory cytokines through a series of transcriptional events mediated by NF-kB.</s><s>Moreover, sugars and carbohydrates stimulate pancreatic islets and insulin-sensitive tissues such as adipose tissue, liver and muscles [7e9].</s><s>Conversely, malnutrition and, in particular, a diet with insufficient protein intake, is associated with frailty, decline in functional status, impaired muscle function, decreased bone mass, immune dysfunction, reduced cognition and mortality <ref type="bibr">[9e11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For all these reasons, assessment of the adequate dietary requirement and administration of the correct nutritional intake could be a fundamental issue to maintain or restore health in advanced age.</s></p><p><s>The European project RISTOMED (www.ristomed.eu),</s><s>a multicenter 'open-label' randomized study (CORDIS FP7), was designed to develop and provide a healthy, personalized and balanced dietary intervention, enriched or not with specific nutraceutical compounds, to decrease and prevent inflammageing, oxidative stress and gut microbiota alteration in healthy elderly people.</s><s>RISTOMED diet was built to reach the recommended daily requirement of nutrients, vitamins and minerals complying with different cultural patterns.</s><s>RISTOMED diet was designed with a particular attention towards those foods and nutrients known or suspected to be able to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress by promoting a healthy gut microbiota in elderly people <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of RISTOMED diet supplemented or not with nutraceuticals on inflammageing and other critical processes (oxidative stress and gut microbiota alteration) in elderly healthy people, taking into account that the health of gut microbiota is associated with the immune functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The primary outcome was the decrease of hsCRP (highsensitivity C-reactive protein) levels in each study arm.</s><s>HsCRP was selected as primary outcome because it is an internationally recognized marker of inflammation and cardiovascular risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Secondary outcomes included other markers of inflammatory and metabolic status, oxidative stress, gut microbiota composition as well as quality of life and physical performance.</s></p><p><s>In the present paper, we report some results of the RISTOMED study, focusing on the effect of RISTOMED diet alone or with three nutraceutical compounds, namely a probiotic blend, an orange peel extract containing d-Limonene and Argan oil, on inflammatory and metabolic markers in healthy elderly subjects.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Observational studies have examined the association of the Mediterranean diet with inflammatory markers in healthy adults, reporting that this dietary regimen is able to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory and proatherogenic genes in elderly people <ref type="bibr">[20e22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The innovative aspect of the European study RISTOMED was to design diets combining traditional foods and recipes with nutraceutical compounds allowing to assess their effectiveness in the context of a personalized balanced Mediterranean diet, the RIS-TOMED diet.</s></p><p><s>Here we show that RISTOMED diet and nutraceutical supplementation can significantly modulate inflammation and insulin resistance parameters, especially in healthy older people with a medium/high inflammatory status.</s><s>Indeed, there is evidence in the literature that glucose metabolism and the inflammatory status are closely related <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Of note, among inflammation related parameters, we also considered gut microbiota modifications induced by dietary interventions and supplementation tested.</s></p><p><s>The anti-inflammatory effect of the RISTOMED diet, with or without supplementation, translated in a significant decrease of ESR in all arms.</s><s>This parameter is a nonspecific indicator of infection and tissue injury often used to monitor chronic inflammation and response to treatment in inflammatory diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, we did not find changes in hsCRP levels after the dietary interventions.</s><s>A recent paper showed that CRP and the proteins that contribute to the ESR, such as fibrinogen, alpha-2 macroglobulin and immunoglobulins have distinct time courses and kinetics.</s><s>Thus, CRP can rise and then fall at a different rate than ESR explaining the disagreements between these measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>RISTOMED diet supplemented with natural d-Limonene extracted from orange peel decreased significantly fibrinogen levels.</s><s>Of interest, this dietary and nutraceutical intervention affected significantly the largest number of parameters, with a major impact on insulin resistance markers.</s></p><p><s>When the subjects were further subdivided according to their baseline inflammatory profile, it is notable that only very few parameters were modified by the RISTOMED diet, stressing the inability to show an improvement in healthy not inflamed old individuals, using the inflammatory biomarkers selected in the RIS-TOMED study.</s><s>Conversely, for subjects presenting a clear "inflammageing" profile, RISTOMED diet supplemented with d-Limonene significantly impacted on both inflammation and insulin resistance markers.</s></p><p><s>This study interestingly included investigation of variations of the microbiome concentrating on Clostridium cluster IV and Bifidobacteria spp.</s><s>In a previous paper, it was shown that RISTOMED diet supplemented with VSL#3 probiotic blend increased Bifidobacteria and supported adequate folate and vitamin B12 concentrations decreasing homocysteine levels and suggesting a protective role for aging associated conditions, e.g.</s><s>cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Here we confirmed that the RISTOMED diet associated with VSL#3 probiotic blend induced a decrease of the ratio between Clostridium cluster IV and Bifidobacteria, suggesting a better survival of Bifidobacteria spp.</s><s>Conversely, the ratio showed a trend for increase in the other arms.</s><s>When subdividing the subjects according to their baseline inflammatory status, striking differences were noted.</s><s>RISTOMED diet supplemented with VSL#3 probiotic blend tended to increase the ratio between Clostridium cluster IV and Bifidobacteria in the "low inflammation group" and to lower it in the "mediumehigh inflammation" group, while RISTOMED diet supplemented with d-Limonene had the reverse effect.</s><s>These variations could be explained by the different targets of probiotics, acting directly on the intestinal microbiome, and d-Limonene, modifying the intestinal barrier function as reported elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in spite of the relatively small size of the subgroups and dispersion of data, non-parametric analysis allowed to demonstrate that a balanced Mediterranean dietary regimen can counteract inflammageing, especially in elderly individuals with already altered inflammation parameters, on a prevention perspective.</s><s>A screening in search of such latent inflammation might guide towards the most appropriate personalized approach.</s><s>It moreover suggests that d-Limonene supplementation in the context of this dietary intervention could have a beneficial effect on older people in limiting the negative influence of chronic inflammation as demonstrated in other models <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and improving insulin resistance parameters.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Flow chart of participants of the
