however, a comparison of OS, PFS and TTIP rates between different reports is highly inaccurate primarily because of the histological heterogeneity of the included tumor types.</s><s>Our cohort was mainly composed of patients with leiomyosarcoma lesions whereas other studies reported more heterogeneous collectives with a variety of different histological sarcoma types <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>An additional, important finding of this study was the positive effect of radiation therapy of primary lesions on the overall survival outcome in treated patients.</s><s>Currently, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating the role of radiation therapy in the management of STS patients and there is growing evidence in support of this therapeutic option <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>However, our patient collective was not specifically selected under the premise of investigating the role of this treatment modality and it is imperative to view the presented result with caution, unless confirmed with a dedicated randomized trial.</s><s>As for tumor response, no consistent data is available with criteria-dependent response rates ranging from 13% to 60% <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Overall, our study has some limitations: First, the retrospective character of this analysis prevented us from a thorough analysis of changes in laboratory parameters of liver function after therapy in all patients.</s><s>Second, our study protocol did not include the assessment of multiple target lesions.</s><s>However, several recent reports did not confirm the benefits of a multi-lesion assessment in the setting of intraarterial therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, semi-automated 3D analysis offers a higher diagnostic accuracy and improved reproducibility of measurements making it less susceptible to reader bias, thus making multiple lesion analysis unnecessary.</s><s>From a technical standpoint, the single-lesion approach can be explained by the therapeutic principle of cTACE as this modality is being applied for treatment in a lesion-by-lesion fashion.</s><s>Thus selecting a dominant, i.e. largest treated lesion for the assessment of treatment response might very well be enough to correctly evaluate the effects of therapy.</s><s>While offering the largest so far reported cohort of sarcoma patients treated with TACE, the sample size of the current study is fairly small and the overall statistical strength of the results can be seen as limited.</s></p></div>
