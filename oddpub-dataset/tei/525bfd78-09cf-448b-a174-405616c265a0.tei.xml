<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Onychophora (velvet worms) represent a crucial taxon for understanding the evolution of vision.</s><s>Onychophorans and tardigrades (water bears) are the closest living relatives of arthropods (chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans and hexapods) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Giribet, 2016)</ref>, which account for the majority of described animal species on Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Zhang, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zhang, , 2013) )</ref> and boast an unrivalled diversity of visual systems and visual ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Land and Nilsson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>To understand the origin and evolution of the sophisticated eyes of arthropods, it is essential to investigate their closest outgroups.</s></p><p><s>Onychophorans and tardigrades possess a pair of simple lateral eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Greven, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mayer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Martin et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>However, tardigrades are microscopic animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gross et al., 2015)</ref>, which makes it challenging to study their behaviour.</s><s>Furthermore, they display many characteristics that are possibly derived because of miniaturization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dewel and Dewel, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Schmidt-Rhaesa, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>To date, the homology of their eyes with the visual systems of arthropods has not been resolved.</s><s>Tardigrade eyes might be innovations specific to their own lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Greven, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Martin et al., 2017)</ref>, although an orthologue of the visual r-opsins (rhabdomeric opsins) of arthropods has been identified in the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hering and Mayer, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, onychophorans are predators of one to several centimetres in length, inhabiting humid, terrestrial environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mayer et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Several aspects of their anatomy are strikingly similar to that of Cambrian lobopodians <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Smith and Caron, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smith and Ortega-Hern√°ndez, 2014)</ref>, an assemblage of marine animals with cylindrical bodies and clawed feet, which probably includes the ancestors of extant panarthropods (onychophorans, tardigrades and arthropods) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liu and Dunlop, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The eyes of onychophorans exhibit a potentially ancestral design, and it has been proposed that they are homologous to arthropod eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mayer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Strausfeld et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>A single r-opsin, named onychopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hering et al., 2012)</ref>, is expressed in the photoreceptors of the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beckmann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Visual r-opsins of arthropods are orthologues of onychopsin, having diverged after the Arthropoda-Onychophora split <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Henze and Oakley, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hering et al., 2012)</ref>, which supports the underlying homology of vision in the two clades.</s><s>Interestingly, the onychophoran eye is most sensitive to blue light of about 480 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beckmann et al., 2015)</ref>, similar to many monochromatic marine animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marshall et al., 2015)</ref>, and this may be an ancestral feature.</s></p><p><s>On account of their phylogenetic position, resemblance to fossil lobopodians, structural and genetic homologies to arthropods, and size, onychophorans are a key clade for understanding the function of the eyes in the last common ancestor of panarthropods.</s><s>Ultimately, it is selective pressure on the performance of visual tasks that drives the evolution of visual systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nilsson, 2013)</ref>, and functional investigations are a necessary component of understanding why a system occurs and has evolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Nilsson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nilsson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Petie et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, despite their importance, the visual capabilities of onychophorans have not been well explored.</s></p><p><s>Here, we investigated the spatial resolution of Euperipatoides rowelli, a nocturnal, forest-dwelling species native to eastern Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Oliveira et al., 2012)</ref>, which has been at the forefront of evolutionary and developmental studies on Onychophora (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blaxter and Sunnucks, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Franke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayer et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Spatial resolution is defined as the angular distance between two points that are just distinguishable by the visual system.</s><s>It is conventionally given as the period of a sine wave, with each of the points representing a maximum, while the sampling resolution (inter-receptor angle) must be half the period of the sine wave, allowing neighbouring receptors to sample a maximum (bright point) and a minimum (dark space between the points).</s><s>Optical resolution is the limit imposed by the blurring of the optics, which is often simulated as a Gaussian function.</s><s>In an optimized visual system, the blurring induced by the optics matches the spatial resolution that the photoreceptors provide, such that excellent optics are not wasted on an under-sampling retina and an over-sampling retina is not wasted on poor optics.</s><s>To examine the image-forming capacity of the eyes of E. rowelli, we developed a geometrical model based on a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and anatomical and optical measurements.</s><s>In a behavioural assay, we tested whether the animals headed for a dark target, ostensibly representing shelter, in a pattern of different widths, which was on average isoluminant with the background.</s><s>The two stimulus patterns closest to the behavioural detection threshold were then used to estimate the spatial resolution of E. rowelli by simulating the blurring effect of the eye's optics in a theoretical model.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals</head><p><s>Specimens of Euperipatoides rowelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reid (1996)</ref>, were collected from decomposing logs in the Tallaganda State Forest (35¬∞26‚Ä≤S, 149¬∞33‚Ä≤E, 954 m) under permit no.</s><s>SL100159 from the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, Australia.</s><s>Adults and their offspring were kept individually in plastic containers with perforated lids at 19¬∞C under a light:dark cycle of 12 h:12 h.</s><s>The containers comprised a layer of peat covered with damp paper tissues, which were moistened weekly.</s><s>We fed small (‚â§10 mm) crickets to the onychophorans every 3 weeks, and replaced peat and tissues 1 or 2 days afterwards.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light response</head><p><s>To exclude potentially blind animals from further experiments, we tested whether they avoided bright light, a spontaneous response that has previously been demonstrated in E. rowelli <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beckmann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Each individual was dark-adapted for 3 min, after which broad-spectrum light from a xenon arc lamp (450 W, Malipiero AV Technik, Zurich, Switzerland) was directed through a UV-VIStransmitting light guide at the animal's head from a distance of 7 cm (intensity &gt;10 14 photons cm ‚àí2 s ‚àí1 ).</s><s>Animals that did not respond to the light beam by retracting the head, a change of direction or an increase in speed in any of five trials were excluded from the study.</s><s>This was the case for one of 52 individuals.</s><s>One of the remaining animals was directly killed for 3D reconstruction of its head and eyes, while the other 50 were subjected to behavioural experiments before they were randomly chosen for anatomical or optical investigations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anatomy</head><p><s>For anatomical measurements and examination (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,  Figs 1 and 2</ref>), three light-adapted specimens of 32-40 mm body length were anaesthetized using CO 2 .</s><s>Their heads were severed between the slime papillae and the first or second pair of legs, fixed in 2% or 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol l ‚àí1 sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7.1 or 7.4) at 4¬∞C for 12 h, and washed repeatedly in buffer.</s><s>Two heads used for both light and electron microscopy were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in buffer for 2 h and washed again.</s><s>All three samples were then dehydrated in an ethanol series, rinsed with acetone, preembedded in Epon for over 12 h, and embedded in fresh Epon, which was polymerized for 48 h at 60¬∞C.</s></p><p><s>The two osmium-treated heads were halved along the sagittal plane, trimmed and oriented in an RMX PTX microtome (Boeckeler Instruments Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) such that the eyes were cut through their centre at different angles.</s><s>Sections of 3 ¬µm thickness were mounted on glass slides, stained with 1% Toluidine Blue in 1% borax and photographed under a Zeiss Axiophot light microscope (Jena, Germany) with a Nikon DS-Fi2-U3 CCD camera (Tokyo, Japan).</s><s>Ultrathin sections were mounted on copper grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate in distilled water, and studied with a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan).</s><s>The third head was used to make a complete series of 3 ¬µm transverse light-microscopic sections from the antennal roots to the slime papillae.</s><s>We processed and imaged the sections as described above and aligned them in Amira 5.3.3</s><s>(FEI Visualization Sciences Group, Burlington, MA, USA) for 3D reconstruction (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; Movie 1).</s><s>The structures of the eyes were reconstructed from 250√ó image stacks and integrated into the head, which was retraced from 50√ó image stacks.</s><s>An anteroposterior section through the centre of the lens of the left eye in the 3D reconstruction served as a template for the geometrical model of the eye (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) created in Adobe Illustrator CS6 (16.0.2,</s><s>Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optical examinations, measurements and calculations</head><p><s>To check for major gradients in refractive index of the lens, one adult specimen was anaesthetized with chloroform and decapitated.</s><s>The head was embedded in freezing medium in a plastic mould (Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound and Tissue-Tek Cryomold, Sakura Finetek Europe B.V., Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) and immediately frozen in ethanol cooled by dry ice.</s><s>Sections of 10-12 ¬µm thickness were cut at ‚àí20¬∞C on a cryostat (CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany), mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel-Gl√§ser, Braunschweig, Germany) and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C.</s><s>Directly before examination, the sections were defrosted and lightly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in distilled water for 10 min, washed in distilled water, and embedded in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</s><s>Differential interference contrast (DIC) images of the eyes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) were taken under a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope with a Zeiss Axiocam 503 colour camera using the software ZEN 2 (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).</s></p><p><s>When we dissected the eyes of specimens of E. rowelli to isolate the optical components, the lens invariably detached from the cornea.</s><s>Therefore, we determined the focal length of the entire eye in several steps by measuring the focal length of the isolated lens in saline, assessing its dimensions, calculating its refractive index, and estimating the focal length of the combination of cornea and lens in an intact eye.</s><s>The whole procedure is detailed below.</s></p><p><s>Specimens of 27-39 mm body length were anaesthetized with CO 2 .</s><s>Their head was severed, placed in a saline solution based on the ion concentrations of onychophoran haemolymph <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Robson et al., 1966)</ref>, and opened along the sagittal plane.</s><s>An incision into the eye cup was sufficient to isolate the lens, which simply popped out.</s><s>We measured the focal length of 10 fresh lenses from six individuals under a bright-field microscope (Labophot-2, SN 440152, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using a 20√ó objective.</s><s>Each lens was immersed in saline between a microscope slide and a coverslip held apart by a spacer of about 1 mm, and positioned such that the axial path of light through the lens corresponded to that of the intact onychophoran eye.</s><s>The condenser of the microscope was removed and a grid of dark stripes on translucent plastic film was placed atop the open field diaphragm.</s><s>Compared with the size of the lens, this object was at infinity, such that incident rays were parallel and the image plane coincided with the back focal plane.</s><s>The equator of the lens was then brought into focus (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>), and the stage was gradually raised until the image of the grid pattern produced by the onychophoran lens was in focus (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>).</s><s>The necessary change in position of the stage, which was given by a micrometre gauge, was taken as a first approximation of the focal length of the lens in saline (f ‚Ä≤ lens ).</s><s>Distal is to the left.</s><s>The cornea (co) consists of several layers, of which the outermost is the old cuticle to be shed.</s><s>The underlying lens (le) appears homogeneous.</s><s>Directly proximal to the lens follows the light-sensitive rhabdomeric layer (rh), surrounded by dark screening pigment ( pg).</s><s>The nuclei of photoreceptors and pigment cells are located in the perikaryal layer ( pk) below the pigment layer.</s><s>Photoreceptor processes connect the distal and proximal parts of the photoreceptor cell.</s><s>The arrowhead points at a position where such a process penetrates the pigment layer.</s><s>(C) Higher magnification of the transition from the lens to the rhabdomeric layer in an electron micrograph.</s><s>Curved microvilli

axis) and the distance between the equator and back vertex, the lens was oriented such that its axis of symmetry was horizontal (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s><s>Images of six lenses from four individuals were taken from directly above with a Nikon D5100 digital camera (Nikon Corporation) through the 20√ó objective of the microscope.</s></p><p><s>The approximate refractive index of the lens

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visually guided behaviour with coarse spatial resolution</head><p><s>Behavioural tests for measuring spatial resolution should ideally rely on stimuli with only one spatial frequency.</s><s>Optomotor responses, such as the constant turning of a walking animal in response to a moving sinusoidal grating, can be used to directly assay spatial resolution by presenting a single spatial frequency.</s><s>We tried to elicit an optomotor response in onychophorans, but the tortuosity of their walking paths made it impossible to identify an overall turning tendency.</s><s>Yet, a different set of experiments revealed that the animals were attracted to dark objects like a black bar presented next to a white bar on a grey background.</s><s>One problem in assessing these responses to determine spatial resolution is that the stimulus contains many spatial frequencies, making it impossible to tell which of these frequencies the animal used for its response.</s><s>We therefore changed from a dual bar to a piecewise sine stimulus.</s><s>It consisted of a central sinusoidal dark area surrounded on both sides by sinusoidal bright areas.</s><s>The dark area and the surrounding bright areas had the same width (i.e.</s><s>spatial frequency), and the amplitudes of the bright and dark areas were chosen such that the whole stimulus was isoluminant with the grey background displayed at all other angles.</s><s>Isoluminance is important because it excludes simple phototaxis to a dark object and requires that the animal must resolve the pattern to detect the target.</s><s>However, even the piecewise sine stimulus contains other spatial frequencies than that of its main sine component, which precludes direct deduction of spatial resolution from the behavioural responses.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we used another approach.</s><s>We calculated optical resolution by simulating how the two stimuli closest to the behavioural detection threshold appeared through the eyes of E. rowelli.</s><s>As the blurring induced by the optics reduces contrast and prevents the detection of finer details, we can infer spatial resolution from optical resolution assuming that the image-forming capacity and contrast sensitivity of the eyes limit the behavioural performance of the animals.</s><s>Neighbouring photoreceptors in the retina can only resolve a pattern if the contrast in the retinal image exceeds or is equal to a certain threshold.</s><s>This threshold contrast is the reciprocal of the animals' contrast sensitivity in per cent.</s><s>Maximal contrast sensitivities among vertebrates have been measured as close to 200 (threshold contrast 0.5%) for humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(De Valois et al., 1974)</ref>, greater than 100 (threshold contrast 1%) for the cat <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bisti and Maffei, 1974)</ref> and in the range of 7 to 31 (threshold contrasts of 14.3% to 3.2%) for birds <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lind et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Among insects, maximum contrast sensitivities towards large targets have been estimated to fall in the same range

measurements are available for onychophorans, we have to hypothesize, and any computed resolution will thus be associated with an assumed contrast sensitivity.</s><s>In our calculations, we took a conservative range of contrast sensitivities from 5 to 20 into account, which yields threshold contrasts from 20% to 5% (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>For the same stimulus pattern, a lower assumed contrast threshold (higher contrast sensitivity) allows stronger blurring (a wider Gaussian filter) until the image cannot be resolved anymore.</s><s>Therefore, the spatial resolution of the eye is most likely worse, meaning that the period of a just-resolvable sine wave is bigger.</s><s>Conversely, a higher assumed contrast threshold (lower contrast sensitivity) of the animal allows less blurring (a narrower Gaussian filter) for the same stimulus pattern until the image can no longer be resolved.</s><s>Therefore, the spatial resolution of the eye is most likely better, meaning that the period of a just-resolvable sine wave is smaller.</s><s>In short, depending on the assumed threshold contrast, we get a different estimate for the spatial resolution and the relationship is inverse.</s></p><p><s>Apart from the assumed contrast sensitivities, the behavioural estimate of the detection threshold, on which our calculations rely, is also conservative for a variety of reasons.</s><s>Firstly, some animals turned their heads and bodies and appeared to scan the environment upon release, whereas, in other instances, the animals moved directly to the arena wall, such that the target may have never entered their field of view.</s><s>Secondly, the animal may detect and perceive the target, but may not always be motivated to approach it.</s><s>Thirdly, the tortuosity of many of the walking paths introduces further noise and may reduce the clustering of headings towards the target.</s><s>Thus, the object taxis exhibited in our experiments may not reflect the maximal resolving power of the eye, and it is likely that we underestimate the spatial resolution of the animals.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the proportion of individuals heading towards the target quadrant was highest for piecewise sine stimuli of 20 deg target width <ref type="bibr">(Figs 7 and 8)</ref>.</s><s>A decline in the concentration of headings around the centre of the piecewise sine stimuli for wider targets, which were clearly beyond the detection threshold, can be explained in a number of ways.</s><s>The stimulus pattern of piecewise sine targets wider than 20 deg exceeds 90 deg.</s><s>Thus, even though the target is still covered by the target quadrant, the whole stimulus is not.</s><s>A sluggish orientation response can cause headings to be directed towards the bright flanks of the dark target rather than the target itself (cf. 10, 13 and 20 deg target in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>If, for wider stimuli, these headings fall outside the target quadrant, they will not be included in the success rate.</s><s>An alternative and, in fact, antithetic explanation, which seems to fit to the distribution of headings for wider piecewise sine stimuli, is that the bright flanks surrounding the target may become increasingly repellent the bigger they are, driving more animals towards the half of the arena opposite to the target.</s><s>Moreover, piecewise sine stimuli with targets wider than 20 deg may be less attractive to the onychophorans for reasons specific to their visual system or ecology.</s><s>The animals may utilize edge detection, i.e. neural filtering to enhance high spatial frequencies that serve as cues to recognize important features of their environment.</s><s>Finally, the decline in the orientation response to wider targets in the experiments with piecewise sine stimuli could simply be a coincidence.</s><s>Except for the control, we do not have a measure of variance for the success rate (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>However, in view of the tortuous walking paths and the limited number of tested individuals, we expect that the results would vary considerably if we repeated the experiments.</s></p><p><s>The onychophoran eye is under-focused and produces a blurry image</s></p><p><s>The possible lack of graded index optics in the eyes of E. rowelli is intriguing, as these gradients are abundant in biological lenses, minimizing spherical aberration and allowing for greater spatial resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Land, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>There are reports of cases in which differences in the refractive index did not show up clearly in standard light or electron microscopic sections (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nilsson, 1990)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, we also investigated DIC images of cryosections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>We did not notice a consistent distinct slope in the apparent height profile of the lens, which would have indicated a strong refractive index gradient.</s><s>However, as these sections were stored at ‚àí80¬∞C for 2 years before they were imaged, it would be desirable to repeat the investigation with fresh lenses.</s><s>In addition to qualitative examinations, a quantitative interferometric assessment of fresh lenses (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nilsson, 1990</ref>) is required to provide conclusive evidence of the refractive index profile of the lens.</s></p><p><s>In any case, the position and organization of the retina alone rule out high acuity vision in E. rowelli.</s><s>The rhabdomeric layer (the site of phototransduction) fills the whole eye chamber, and our calculations for the central part of the eye place the focal plane far beyond the retina (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), resulting in an under-focused image.</s><s>Even if a perfectly focused image fell on the rhabdomeric layer, the unordered network of densely packed, interdigitating microvilli from different photoreceptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Eakin and Westfall, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mayer, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,D</ref>) would preclude a better spatial resolution (no well-defined sampling points).</s><s>Thus, the visual system of E. rowelli provides a blurrier image and a lower range of spatial frequencies than feasible for a lens eye of that size.</s><s>This suggests that E. rowelli does not utilize behaviours that require the detection of high spatial frequencies.</s><s>However, better-focused light through other visual axes may provide greater spatial resolution.</s><s>The peculiar ellipsoid shape of the eye, the asymmetric lens position (further away from the posterior than the anterior end of the eye) and the tilted orientation of the lens ( pointing slightly forward) may improve spatial resolution in the forward direction.</s><s>To describe the optical capabilities of this eye design in more detail, sophisticated raytracing is required.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual ecology of onychophorans</head><p><s>The spatial resolution exhibited behaviourally by E. rowelli constitutes low-resolution vision (class III in the classification of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nilsson, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>While our study has exploited the attraction of this species to dark targets, vision may be used for other tasks and these may drive selection on the resolving power of the visual system.</s><s>Seeking shelter or identifying specific microhabitats in the foliage by identifying dark areas is commensurate with the object taxis demonstrated in our experiments.</s><s>Onychophorans are known to avoid bright light <ref type="bibr">(Monge-N√°jera et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hering et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beckmann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>They dry out easily, and bright parts in their environment may be interpreted as a warning of direct sun exposure.</s><s>Other possible visual tasks include detection of obstacles and finding a clear path.</s><s>The spatial resolution we demonstrated in E. rowelli is insufficient for spotting or identifying prey and conspecifics beyond a few centimetres from the eye.</s><s>Onychophorans hunt by spraying an immobilizing adhesive following direct contact with the prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Read and Hughes, 1987)</ref> and will also use this behaviour if threatened.</s><s>Coarse-resolving vision could possibly aid in aiming the glue spray towards a prey or looming predator at close distance.</s><s>In addition, social behaviour is reported in E. rowelli, including group hunting and feeding, the latter according to a dominance hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Reinhard and Rowell, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Further experiments involving intraspecific or interspecific interactions in varied light conditions or with blinded specimens could be used to assess the contribution of vision to these behaviours.</s></p><p><s>Although onychophorans are nocturnal and typically active in dim light <ref type="bibr">(Monge-N√°jera et al., 1993)</ref>, the results presented here were obtained under ample photon availability (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>Many animals increase absolute sensitivity at the expense of spatial resolution at low light intensities by optical or neural pooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Land and Nilsson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>We cannot rule out such a mechanism in E. rowelli in general.</s><s>However, the eye (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) revealed no adjustable pupil or other optical structure that would dynamically change both absolute sensitivity and spatial resolution.</s><s>Photoreceptor responses in onychophoran eyes are slow, suggesting that they lack high temporal resolution, and become even slower with decreasing light intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beckmann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In fact, high temporal resolution is not vitally important to an animal that only moves about 1 cm per second <ref type="bibr">(Monge-N√°jera et al., 1993)</ref> and hunts primarily using its antennae <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Read and Hughes, 1987)</ref>.</s><s>The low temporal resolution of its eyes might allow E. rowelli to maintain the same coarse spatial resolution down to nocturnal light levels.</s><s>Overall, the eye design of this species seems to be optimized for enhanced light capture rather than high-acuity vision.</s></p><p><s>Implications for the evolution of arthropod eyes Cambrian lobopodians are an assemblage that probably includes the ancestors of modern panarthropods <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liu and Dunlop, 2014)</ref> and broadly resemble modern onychophorans.</s><s>Several fossil forms have cephalic features, which are interpreted as onychophoran-like simple dorsal or lateral eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Liu and Dunlop, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ou et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Smith and Caron, 2015)</ref>, including early Cambrian Onychodictyon ferox <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ou et al., 2012)</ref>, Miraluolishania haikouensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liu et al., 2004)</ref> and Antennacanthopodia gracilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ou et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>It is tempting to draw parallels between the eyes of onychophorans and those of ancient lobopodians.</s><s>However, the fossil evidence is limited and early Cambrian lobopodians were marine, which reduces the refractive power of the cornea and results in rapid attenuation of long-wavelength light within the water column.</s><s>Nonetheless, given an eye of comparable size, we could anticipate low spatial resolution (class III in the classification of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nilsson, 2013)</ref> in early lobopodians, concomitant with the respective repertoire of visual behaviours (e.g.</s><s>seeking shelter, and shadow or light avoidance).</s><s>The sophisticated and varied visual organs of arthropods, such as jumping spiders, stomatopods or flying insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Land and Nilsson, 2012)</ref>, which can be used for fast interactions with small objects, must have evolved from such a simple progenitor.</s></p></div>
