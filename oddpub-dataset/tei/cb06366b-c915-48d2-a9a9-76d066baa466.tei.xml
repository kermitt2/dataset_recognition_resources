<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a frequent complication of SSc with a prevalence $10% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Right heart catheterization (RHC) is mandatory for the diagnosis of PAH.</s><s>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined on RHC by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 525 mmHg at rest with a mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (mPAWP) of &lt;15 mmHg <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Within the last two decades, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and PAH have become the leading causes of death in SSc patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The estimated 3 year survival among patients with PAH associated with SSc without therapy is $5060%</s></p><p><s>[69] and is worse than the prognosis observed in idiopathic PAH.</s><s>Many factors can explain this dismal prognosis.</s><s>Among them, older age, cardiomyopathy and the high prevalence of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease have been proposed.</s><s>Moreover, PAH is often diagnosed in an advanced stage in SSc, with up to 75% of patients being in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV.</s><s>To improve this prognosis, and taking the high prevalence of PAH into account, yearly screening for PAH in SSc patients is suggested by various guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Thus far, echocardiography is the most used screening tool for suspect PH in SSc.</s><s>Based on the tricuspid regurgitant jet (TRJ) velocity, estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) can be calculated using the Bernoulli equation and adding estimated right atrial pressure (RAP).</s><s>The European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) diagnostic algorithm in SSc patients with suspected PH is based on the maximal TRJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: a patient with a TRJ of 42.8 m/s (estimated sPAP 436 mmHg, assuming mean RAP (mRAP) 45 mmHg) is unlikely to have PH.</s><s>Based on this algorithm, RHC should be considered in SSc patients with suspected PH if the TRJ is between 2.9 and 3.4 m/s (corresponding to an estimate sPAP of between 37 and 50 mmHg, assuming RAP is 5 mmHg) in symptomatic patients and if the TRJ is &gt;3.4 m/s (corresponding to an estimate sPAP &gt;50 mmHg, assuming RAP is 5 mmHg) in non-symptomatic patients.</s><s>We have previously shown in a large nationwide prospective study that if RHC is performed in the case of a TRJ &gt;2.8 m/s, it is possible to identify at an early stage SSc patients suffering from PAH and survival can be improved with early therapeutic intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11]</ref>.</s><s>In the trans-sectional study performed initially, we used a TRJ cut-off of 2.5 m/s, which seemed too low to identify SSc patients at risk of PH and produced a relatively high percentage of false-positive results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, in real practice, RHC is not systematically performed in all SSc patients in whom PH is suspected.</s><s>Therefore, while the prognosis of RHC-proven PAH is known, there are no data on the prognostic value of estimate sPAP, regardless of the presence of RCH-proven PH, whatever the mechanism of PH.</s><s>Thus the aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of sPAP estimated from the TRJ measured by echocardiography to predict 5 year survival in patients with SSc using the multinational European League Against Rheumatism Scleroderma Trial and Research (EUSTAR) cohort.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population</head><p><s>From June 2004 onwards, EUSTAR centres were requested to enter patient data into a web database, provided that the patients had given their informed written consent.</s><s>Data were to be collected at each visit and at least once a year.</s><s>Since the aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value of estimated sPAP in the modern PAH therapeutic era, data collected from 2005 to 31 December 2011 were extracted from the EUSTAR database.</s><s>The database started in 2004, but information about sPAP was requested from 2007 with the development of the online database.</s><s>It was also possible from 2007 to enter patients with a record of previous echocardiographies performed before 2007.</s><s>Patients were selected if they had a first echocardiography after 1 January 2005 with at least one follow-up visit between the 1 January 2005 and the 31 December 2011.</s><s>The first echocardiography performed after 1 January 2005 with an evaluation of sPAP was termed the index echocardiography.</s><s>Data of all subsequent visits were used provided that at least one echocardiography and/or RHC was performed.</s></p><p><s>Patients with PH or PAH documented by a RHC before 1 January 2005 were also excluded from the study.</s><s>The EUSTAR scientific committee approved the evaluation of the prognostic value of sPAP in patients suffering from SSc included in the EUSTAR database.</s><s>Ethics committee approval for the study was obtained from each participating EUSTAR centre (based on Ethics Committee Approval, Basel, Switzerland, no.</s><s>323/09).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collected data</head><p><s>Collected data included demographics, history of RP, history of the first non-RP symptom of SSc, subtype of SSc (diffuse, limited or other), modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), history of renal crisis, immunological status, dyspnoea level based on the NYHA classification, history of digital ulcers, systemic treatments and co-morbidity with systemic hypertension.</s><s>Available data regarding echocardiography [TRJ, sPAP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), diastolic dysfunction, pericardial effusion], RHC (right ventricular systolic pressure, mPAP, pulmonary resistance, PAWP, cardiac index), 6 min walking test (distance walked, oxygen saturation at rest and during exercise), pulmonary function tests, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were collected at the date of the index echocardiography.</s><s>The different sPAP categories were based on the 2009 ESC/ERS recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: if sPAP is &lt;36 mmHg, PH is unlikely; if sPAP is &gt;36 mmHg but &lt;50 mmHg, PH is possible and if sPAP is &gt;50 mmHg, PH is likely.</s><s>A restrictive lung syndrome was defined as a FVC or TLC &lt;70% of predicted.</s><s>If available, data regarding lung fibrosis from a high-resolution CT scan were entered in the database.</s></p><p><s>Survival status of the patient was evaluated at the date of the last available information.</s><s>If the patient died during the follow-up period, the date of death was provided by the centre.</s><s>We also asked all centres with at least one patient meeting inclusion criteria whether RHC was performed during follow-up and to provide the results, in case the information was missing in the EUSTAR database.</s><s>A data review was conducted prior to analysis in order to determine whether the patient could be included in the analysis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The international guidelines recommend echocardiographic screening in SSc for the detection of PH in symptomatic patients [World Health Organization (WHO) class I, level B] <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and may be considered in asymptomatic patients (WHO class IIb, level C).</s><s>Moreover, experts recommend that systematic screening of PH should be done at least yearly in all SSc patients because it is the only way to detect early PAH <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>, allowing early management with better survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study we have demonstrated that the best cut-off for sPAP in terms of survival prognostic factor is 36 mmHg (corresponding to a TRJ of 2.8 m/s, assuming mRAP is 5 mmHg).</s><s>sPAP was an independent risk factor for death in patients with SSc who were not known to be suffering from PH or PAH at the time of the index echocardiography, with a HR of 3.02 (95% CI 1.91, 4.78) for sPAP 536 mmHg.</s><s>In a smaller, single-centre study (n = 115), Kiatchoosakun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> showed that sPAP was independently associated with decreased survival, with a 3 year survival rate of 67%, which is very close to the present analysis.</s><s>While it was interesting to demonstrate that sPAP is an independent risk factor for death, irrespective of the presence of PH, and irrespective of the patient's status and the final diagnosis, the fact that 16.1% of patients with sPAP &gt;36 mmHg (corresponding to a TRJ &gt;2.8 m/s, assuming the mRAP is 5 mmHg) at the index echocardiography never underwent RHC over the follow-up period is surprising (each centre was individually contacted to determine whether, from the date of the index echocardiography to 31 December 2011, patients underwent RHC and, if yes, what was the result).</s><s>Indeed, as a patient with a TRJ &gt;3.4 m/s (or sPAP &gt;50 mmHg) is likely to have PH, RHC is indicated to confirm the diagnosis according to ESC/ERS recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>It seems likely that sometimes poor access to RHC and the fear of asking for RHC may contribute to this low number of patients with a clear indication for RHC but with no RHC performed.</s><s>As a limitation, we know that echocardiography has some weakness in identifying SSc patients at risk of PH.</s><s>Notably, TRJ of measurable quality was $8186% when the Doppler evaluation was performed by a highly experienced echocardiographer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>.</s><s>We previously found that in SSc patients with TRJ &gt;2.5 m/s, 55% had PAH on RHC, another 10% had post-capillary PH and 18% had borderline mPAP (between 21 and 24 mmHg) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Coghlan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> recently showed that 20% of SSc patients with PAH had TRJ 42.5 m/s and 36% had TRJ 42.8 m/s.</s><s>Based on the EUSTAR database, Tyndall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> found that suspected PH based on echocardiography was an independent risk factor of death.</s><s>In the study performed by Fransen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, which was also based on the EUSTAR database, age, ESR and DLCO &lt;70% of predicted were independent factors of death, with an OR of 1.94 for DLCO &lt;70%.</s><s>Our results suggest that while these three disease factors may predict 5 year survival at SSc diagnosis, sPAP (and TRJ) should now also be considered as another independent survival prognostic factor.</s></p><p><s>As reported by Steen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, DLCO may be significantly decreased (i.e.</s><s>&lt;60% of normal) for many years prior to the occurrence of PAH.</s><s>In the DETECT study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, among SSc patients with &gt;3 years of evolution and a DLCO &lt;60% of predicted without severe ILD or severe known left heart disease, it was shown that of 466 patients who underwent RHC, 31% (n = 144) had PH, 19% (n = 87) had PAH, 6% (n = 30) had post-capillary PH and 6% (n = 27) had PH associated with ILD.</s><s>In the present study we have demonstrated that a DLCO &lt;64%, independent of pulmonary or cardiac status, is an independent risk factor for death in SSc.</s><s>An index DLCO of &lt;64% was also associated with a 4.87-fold risk of death (95% CI <ref type="bibr">1.3, 17.6)</ref>.</s><s>From the DETECT study, we know that 31% of SSc patients with a DLCO &lt;60% of predicted have PH.</s><s>Consequently we should consider that all SSc patients with a sPAP &gt;36 mmHg (corresponding to a TRJ &gt;2.8 m/s, assuming mRAP is 5 mmHg) and/or a DLCO &lt;64% are at a high risk of PH and subsequently of death.</s><s>These patients should be monitored carefully and the question of performing RHC should be discussed on a regular basis.</s><s>As $50% of the patients in the EUSTAR database had no documented sPAP, we recommend that regular echocardiography screening should be performed.</s><s>Moreover, since 83.6% of the patients who had sPAP &gt;36 mmHg (corresponding to TRJ &gt;2.8 m/s, assuming mRAP is 5 mmHg) never underwent RHC during the follow-up period, this should be considered a red flag pointing to a life-threatening situation that needs to be investigated.</s><s>In such cases, RHC is mandatory to confirm or exclude PH and to clearly categorize the mechanism of PH.</s></p><p><s>There are some strengths and limitations of our study.</s><s>The strengths are the large number of patients analysed,  the real-life conditions and the confirmation of data regarding survival status by each centre for all analysed patients.</s><s>In contrast, the key limitations of our (real-life) study are that patients were selected on available sPAP.</s><s>This may have induced a selection bias towards patients exhibiting symptoms, thus impairing inference to the whole population of SSc patients.</s><s>Selection bias is more likely at earlier times, where regular screening assessment was not the rule, but is less likely after the recommendations regarding regular echocardiographic screening for PAH were published.</s><s>There are some missing data (e.g. the 6 min walking test was documented in only 268 patients and could not be used for the multivariate analysis) and individual practices in each centre varied regarding the decision to perform RHC in patients with sPAP 536 mmHg, which certainly impacted the delay of PH diagnosis.</s><s>In addition, because the centre did not answer our query, we were able to analyse only 1476 patients of 1946 meeting the inclusion criteria.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our data support the idea that in routine clinical management of SSc patients, sPAP 536 mmHg should be seen as a red flag indicating a high risk of death, resulting in immediate RHC to identify or exclude PH.</s></p></div><figure
