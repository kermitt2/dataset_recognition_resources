The present datasets contain the Open Data statements detected by ODDPub V5.1 for the test and validation datasets used for the development of ODDPub (https://github.com/quest-bih/oddpub).

All datasets have the same basic output colums. Datasets 2 and 3 have two additional columns that contain the results of the manual screening.


The columns are explained in the following:

	doi: DOI of the screened publication (string)
	oddpub_open_data: Was Open Data statement detected? (boolean)
	oddpub_open_code: Was Open Code statement detected? (boolean)
	open_data_statements: Extracted Open Data statement (string)
	open_code_statements: Extracted Open Code statement (string)

Additionally we have for datasets 2 and 3:

	manual_open_data: Was Open Data detected in the manual screening? (boolean)
	manual_open_code: Was Open Code detected in the manual screening? (boolean)
