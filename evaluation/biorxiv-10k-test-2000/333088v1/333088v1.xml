<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Larvae of <italic>Drosophila jambulina</italic> belonging to montium subgroup were tested for pupation site preference in relation to temperature. At higher temperature (30 &#x00B0;C), larvae preferred to pupate on food whereas at lower temperature (21 &#x00B0;C) pupation occurred on the cotton. Genetic basis of larval pupation behavior was studied by conducting reciprocal crosses for 30 generations on food-selected and on cotton-selected larvae. Results from genetic analysis between food-selected and cotton-selected strains suggested a single gene responsible for the pupation site preference, with F1 progeny pupated on cotton and F2 (F1&#x00D7;;F1) larvae pupated on both food as well on cotton. Although we found no change in morphological traits in food <italic>vs.</italic> cotton selected population, significantly different growth rate (body weight) between the two strains was observed. These results suggest that pupation site preferences can affect life-history traits in <italic>D. jambulina.</italic></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A behavioral phenotype is influenced by both genotype and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sokal et al., 1960</xref>). Difference in pupation site choice can reflect larval difference in the method of finding food as well as difference in niche breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Jaenike, 1985</xref>). Since the larvae of <italic>Drosophila</italic> inhabit in a challenging environment surrounded by various parasites, predators, abiotic stresses such as excessive heat and cold, prior to pupation larvae initiate wandering behavior to find the thermally favorable locations for pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dillon et al., 2009</xref>). For example, it has been observed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> tends to pupate close to the food when temperatures are high whereas at lower temperatures pupation occurs high on the vial sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Schnebel and Grossfield, 1992</xref>). However, these pupation height differences may not depend on temperature <italic>per se</italic>, rather on correlates of temperature, such as the moisture content of the food and the humidity of the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sokal et al., 1960</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have revealed that pupation site preference (PSP) in various species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is affected by both biotic (sex, density, locomotory path length, developmental time and digging behavior) and abiotic (temperature, humidity, moisture, light and dark and pH) factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sokal et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">de Souza et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Fogleman and Markow, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Pandey and Singh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hodge et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hodge and Caslaw, 1997</xref>). Additionally, genetic factors control the pupation behavior in various species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">de Souza et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bauer and Sokolowski, 1985</xref>, 1989; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Florez et al., 1989</xref>). For example, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Joshi and Muller (1993)</xref> reported that pupation height is a polygenic trait that responds effectively to bidirectional selection. Furthermore, it has been found that preference of larvae to pupate on food or at the bottom of culture bottles is because of difference in a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">de Souza et al., 1970</xref>). Our primary aim in this study is to establish the genetic basis of laboratory selected strain with food pupation site preference and cotton site preference in <italic>D. jambulina</italic>. Further we intended to analyze effects of direct selection on traits related to morphology and life-history after every five generations. Conclusions of the present study are based on i) maintenance of selection experiment in laboratory for 30 generations, ii) measurement of genetic variation in the traits after every five generations.</p>

<title>Habitat selection</title>
<p>Samples of wild <italic>D. jambulina</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 100-120) were collected from three geographically distinct sites of the Indian subcontinent (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Samplings were done in months of February-March using net sweeping and bait trap method from fruit markets, godowns and nurseries from each of the localities. Based on the average temperature of the sampling localities, cultures were maintained at 21 &#x00B0;C. To maintain the low density (30-40 eggs per vial) egg laying period was restricted for 6 to 8 hours. Climatic data of sampling localities were taken from the website of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tropmet.res.in">www.tropmet.res.in</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Food pupation and cotton pupation site</title>
<p>To carry out the selection experiment, four different stocks were maintained each with sufficient variation for pupation site preference. For each stock, 50 pairs of arbitrarily selected flies were isolated in separate wide-mouth bottles (300 mL capacity). Additionally, a control population was maintained and was not subjected to any selection regime. In the selection experiment, 100 males and 100 females derived from food pupae as well as from cotton pupae from each generation were selected to initiate the next generation. Selection method for each of the mass-bred stocks was followed independently. This selection procedure was followed independently for each of the mass-bred stocks. Selection experiment was carried out for 30 generations which resulted in food-selected strains (L1, L2, L3, and L4) and cotton-selected strains (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Replicates of each of the selected strains (L1, L2, L3, and L4 and H1, H2, H3, and H4) were kept under relaxed selection after the 30th generation i.e., from the 31st through the 35th generation. These replicate strains were maintained with the same number of flies without any further selection regime. The response of the selection was measured after every fifth generation.</p>

<title>Genetic crosses</title>
<p>To determine the genetic basis of pupation site preference and allelic dominance, a set of eight crosses between laboratory-selected true-breeding food strain (L) and cotton strain (H) differing in pupation behavior was performed. Each of the eight crosses was made using virgin1H&#x2640; and 1L &#x2642; to obtain F1 progeny.</p>
<p>To understand the pattern of inheritance, reciprocal crosses (virgin 1L &#x2640; and 1H &#x2642;) were also set in equal numbers. The F1 progeny were then checked for pupation site preference. To obtain F2 generation, 50 &#x2642; and 50 &#x2640; (five sets of 10 pairs each) were randomly selected from L1 progeny. After pupation, preference site of larvae were examined and number of pupae on each site (food <italic>vs</italic>. cotton) were counted.</p>

<p>For selection regime, populations having maximum viability in pupation site preference (PSP) were used.

<title>Genetic basis of pupation site preference</title>
<p>True breeding strains were used for cotton-selected (HH) and food-selected (LL) strains to examine the genetic basis as well as allelic dominance for pupation site preference. Reciprocal crosses for F1 progeny always pupated on cotton (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table1</xref>). In reciprocal F2 crosses (F1&#x00D7;;F1), larvae pupated on both food as well on cotton and phenotypic ratios of F strain and L strain pupae followed Mendelian F2 ratio (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table1</xref>). These results showed Mendelian mode of inheritance of a single gene with two alleles.</p>

<title>Geographical difference in pupation site preference</title>
<p>Larvae derived from natural populations showed variation in pupation site preference corresponding to geographical populations. Data of pupation site preference in three geographically distinct populations of <italic>D. jambulina</italic> are shown in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>. The F2 progeny (pupae) of reciprocal genetic crosses of food-selected and cotton-selected strains resulted in pupation site preference differences in two classes (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Therefore, results of F2 crosses were checked in the wild-caught samples (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Contrasting patterns of pupation site preference in northern versus southern populations of <italic>D. jambulina</italic> were found. Frequency of pupae on food was three times higher than on cotton in northern populations (Rohtak and Kalka) whereas in southern population (Trivandrum) a reverse trend was observed with three times more frequency of pupae on cotton than on food.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have examined the effect of growth temperatures and its genetic basis on laboratory-selected strains of <italic>Drosophila jambulina</italic> for pupation site preference (PSP). Results showed a considerable variation in pupation site preference in natural populations corresponding to temperature variation. Previous studies have shown that temperatures can affect larval behavior which may cause significant variation in PSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Rodriguez and Sokolowski, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Schnebel and Grossfield, 1986</xref>, 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Vandal and Shivanna, 2007</xref>). Our results are consistent with these studies, as we found that frequency of pupae pupating on food and on cotton varied with temperatures. At higher temperature (30 &#x00B0;C), larvae pupated on food whereas at lower temperature (21 &#x00B0;C) pupation occurred on the cotton used to plug the mouth of the culture bottles. The variation observed in the PSP may be attributed to amount of synthesis of glue protein. Higher temperature (30 &#x00B0;C) acts as a inducer for the synthesis of large quantities of glue protein and helps the pupae to stick to the food for the pupation while at lower temperature (21 &#x00B0;C) decrease in quantity of synthesized glue protein allow larvae to move along with sides of container for pupation on cotton.</p>
<p>The frequency of F2 progeny (pupae) of genetic crosses between food-selected and cotton-selected strains in our study was close to Mendelian ratio suggesting that inheritance of PSP fit a single-gene locus with two alleles. However, inheritance of pupation behavior may differ between species. For example, inheritance of PSP in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> was found to have additive polygenic model of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bauer and Sokolowski, 1988</xref>). The disparity in pupation behavior in different species could be due to different adaptive values in their gene pools.</p>
<p>Although limited number of traits can be studied through artificial selection experiments, they can directly reveal patterns of responses and co-responses of selected traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ramniwas et al., 2013</xref>). For <italic>D. jambulina</italic>, rapid response to direct selection of pupation site confirms the presence of genetic variation for the selected trait. Furthermore, results suggest pleiotropic effects of some of the genes that control the variation in pupation site preference. As in our experiment we found association of pupation behavior with fitness of the flies.</p>
<p>Our results show that having a strong preference for either site (food or cotton) affect individual&#x2019;s fitness. Flies eclosed from cotton-selected pupae showed decrease in body weight while body weight was observed in food-selected pupae. The difference in weight could be attributed to the fact that food-selected pupae get all the food for themselves without any competition as cotton larvae leave the food two days before pupation. Morphological traits (wing length, wing width and thorax length), did not respond to selection in <italic>Drosophila jambulina.</italic> However, growth temperature caused change in allelic dominance. This could be due to different adaptive values of alleles in different environment.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the study, a rapid response to bidirectional selection for food-selected and cotton-selected strains in <italic>D. jambulina</italic> was observed. Genetic crosses between laboratory-selected food and cotton strains showed 3:1 Mendelian ratio in both the crosses (F2). Our data fit a single-gene locus model for pupation site preference in <italic>D. jambulina</italic>. Selected strains lack effect of temperature, but in F1 and F2 progeny (pupae) effect of temperature was clearly visible. Selected strains of <italic>D. jambulina</italic> developed an adaptive behavioral polymorphism. Additionally, we found that difference in pupation site preference affect life-history traits in <italic>D. jambulina</italic>.</p>
