<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mammalian TET enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher oxidized derivatives. TETs are targets of the enzyme OGT, which post-translationally modifies intracellular proteins in response to cellular nutrient status. The biological implications of the OGT-TET interaction have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we show for the first time that modification of TET1 by OGT enhances its activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. We identify a previously uncharacterized domain of TET1 responsible for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the OGT-TET1 interaction. Finally, we show that the interaction between TET1 and OGT is necessary for TET1 to rescue <italic>tet</italic> mutant zebrafish hematopoetic stem cell formation, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1&#x2019;s function in development. Our results demonstrate regulation of TET activity by OGT <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results link metabolism and epigenetic control, which may be relevant to the developmental and disease processes regulated by these two enzymes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Methylation at the 5&#x2019; position of cytosine in DNA is a widespread epigenetic regulator of gene expression. Proper deposition and removal of this mark is indispensable for normal vertebrate development, and misregulation of DNA methylation is a common feature in many diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The discovery of the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of enzymes, which iteratively oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), has expanded the epigenome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. These modified cytosines have multiple roles, functioning both as transient intermediates in an active DNA demethylation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and as stable epigenetic marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] that may recruit specific readers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>One interesting interaction partner of TET proteins is <italic>O</italic>-linked N-acetylglucosamine (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc) Transferase (OGT). OGT is the sole enzyme responsible for attaching a GlcNAc sugar to serine and threonine residues of over 1,000 nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Like phosphorylation, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is a reversible modification that affects the function of target proteins. OGT&#x2019;s targets regulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], consistent with OGT&#x2019;s role in development and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>OGT stably interacts with and modifies all three TET proteins and its genome-wide distribution overlaps significantly with TETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Two studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have suggested that TET1 and OGT may be intimately linked in regulation of gene expression, as depleting either enzyme reduced the chromatin association of the other and affected expression of its target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. However, it is unclear to what extent these genome-wide changes are direct effects of perturbing the TET1-OGT interaction. Further work is necessary to uncover the biological importance of the partnership between TET1 and OGT.</p>
<p>In this work, we map the interaction between TET1 and OGT to a small C-terminal region of TET1, that is both necessary and sufficient to bind OGT. We show for the first time that OGT modifies the catalytic domain of TET1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and enhances its catalytic activity. Finally, we show that OGT levels correlate with TET activity in mESCs and use mutant TET1 to show that the TET1-OGT interaction promotes Tet1 function in the developing zebrafish embryo. Together these results suggest that OGT regulates TET1 activity, indicating that the TET1-OGT interaction may be two-fold in function &#x2013; allowing TET1 to recruit OGT to specific genomic loci and allowing OGT to modulate TET1 activity.</p>

<title>Recombinant protein purification</title>
<p>Full-length human OGT in the pBJG vector was transformed into BL-21 DE3 E. coli. A liquid culture was grown in LB &#x002B; 50ug/mL kanamycin at 37C until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 1.0. IPTG was added to 1mM final and the culture was induced at 16C overnight. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 5mL BugBuster (Novagen) &#x002B; protease inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich) per gram of cell pellet. Cells were lysed on an orbital shaker for 20 minutes at room temperature. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000g for 30 minutes at 4C. Clarified lysate was bound to Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at 4C and then poured over a disposable column.

Constructs were cloned into the pFastBac HTA vector and transformed in DH10Bac E. coli for recombination into a bacmid. Bacmid containing the insert was isolated and used to transfect adherent sf9 cells for 6 days at 25C. Cell media (P1 virus) was isolated and used to infect 20mL of sf9 cells in suspension for 3 days. Cell media (P2 virus) was isolated and used to infect a larger sf9 suspension culture for 3 days. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20mM Tris pH 8, 1&#x0025; Triton, 10&#x0025; glycerol, 20mM imidazole, 50mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5mM TCEP, protease inhibitors, 2.5U/mL benzonase), and lysed by douncing and agitation at 4C for 1 hour. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 48,000g for 30 minutes at 4C and bound to Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at 4C, then poured over a disposable column. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer (20mM Tris pH 8, 0.3&#x0025; Triton, 10&#x0025; glycerol, 20mM imidazole, 250mM NaCl, 0.5mM TCEP, protease inhibitors). The protein was eluted in 5 column volumes of elution buffer (20mM Tris pH 8, 250mM imidazole, 250mM NaCl, 0.5mM TCEP, protease inhibitors). Positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight into storage buffer (20mM Tris pH 8, 150mM NaCl, 0.5mM TCEP). Dialyzed protein was purified by size exclusion chromatography on a 120mL Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare).

<title>Preparation of lambda DNA substrate</title>
<p>Linear genomic DNA from phage lambda (dam-, dcm-) containing 12bp 5&#x2019; overhangs was purchased from Thermo Scientific. Biotinylation was performed by annealing and ligating a complementary biotinylated DNA oligo. Reactions containing 175ng/uL lambda DNA, 2uM biotinylated oligo, and 10mM ATP were assembled in 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer, heated to 65C, and cooled slowly to room temperature to anneal. 10uL T4 DNA ligase was added and ligation was performed overnight at room temperature. Biotinylated lambda DNA was purified by PEG precipitation. To a 500uL ligation reaction, 250uL of PEG8000 &#x002B; 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added and reaction was incubated at 4C overnight with rotation.

<title>mRNA rescue experiments</title>
<p>Zebrafish husbandry was conducted under full animal use and care guidelines with approval by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering animal care and use committee. For mRNA rescue experiments, mTET1D2018A and mTET1wt plasmids were linearized by NotI digestion. Capped RNA was synthesized using mMessage mMachine (Ambion) with T7 RNA polymerase. RNA was injected into one-cell-stage embryos derived from tet2<sup>mk17/mk17</sup>, tet3<sup>mk18/&#x002B;</sup> intercrosses at the concentration of 100pg/embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Injected embryos were raised under standard conditions at 28.5&#x00B0;C until 30 hours post-fertilization (hpf) at which point they were fixed for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using an antisense probe for <italic>runx1</italic>. The <italic>runx1</italic> probe is described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]; <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed using standard methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. <italic>tet2/3</italic> double mutants were identified based on morphological criteria and mutants were confirmed by PCR genotyping after in situ hybridization using previously described primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>For sample size estimation for rescue experiments, we assume a background mean of 20&#x0025; positive animals in control groups. We anticipate a significant change would result in at least a 30&#x0025; difference between the experimental and control means with a standard deviation of no more than 10. Using the 1-Sample Z-test method, for a specified power of 95&#x0025; the minimum sample size is 4. Typically, zebrafish crosses generate far more embryos than required. Experiments are conducted using all available embryos. The experiment is discarded if numbers for any sample are below this minimum threshold when embryos are genotyped at the end of the experimental period. Results from five independent experiments were reported; p values were derived from the unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
<p>For the dot blot, genomic DNA was isolated from larvae at 30hpf by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Following RNase treatment and denaturation, 2-fold serially diluted DNA was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.

<title>OGT enhances TET activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells</title>
<p>TETs have been implicated in localizing OGT to chromatin, however a role for OGT in regulation of TETs has not been fully explored. To examine whether OGT can regulate activity of a TET protein, we employed recombinant enzymes to assess the effects of OGT on TET1 activity. We purified recombinant mouse TET1 catalytic domain (rTET1 CD, aa1367-2039) from sf9 cells and recombinant human OGT (rOGT; identical to mouse at 1042 of 1046 residues) from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>). rTET1 CD catalyzed formation of 5hmC on an <italic>in vitro</italic> methylated lambda DNA substrate, dependent on the presence of the TET cofactors alpha-ketoglutarate, Fe<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, and ascorbic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). Incubation of rTET1 CD with rOGT and OGT&#x2019;s cofactor UDP-GlcNAc resulted in <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of rTET1 CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Modified rTET1 CD produced more 5hmC than unmodified rTET1 CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), indicating that OGT stimulates the activity of the TET1 CD <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>To examine whether OGT affects TET activity in a more biological context, we assessed the effects of altering OGT levels in mESCs. These cells express TET1 and TET2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and the proteins that remove 5fC and 5caC and replace them with unmodified cytosine. Thus increased TET activity should manifest as decreased 5mC and 5hmC. We examined levels of 5mC and 5hmC in mESCs overexpressing OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>) by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and by slot blot of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). These experiments clearly show that overexpression of OGT reduces the levels of both 5mC and 5hmC, consistent with increased TET activity oxidizing 5hmC to 5fC and 5caC. These results are consistent with OGT stimulation of TET activity in mESCs.</p>

<title>A short C-terminal region of TET1 is necessary for binding to OGT</title>
<p>To examine whether OGT regulates TET1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is necessary to specifically disrupt the TET1-OGT interaction. All three TETs interact with OGT via their catalytic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We sought to identify the domain within the TET1 CD responsible for binding to OGT. The TET1 CD consists of a cysteine rich N-terminal region necessary for co-factor and substrate binding, a catalytic fold consisting of two lobes separated by a spacer of unknown function, and a short C-terminal region also of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We transiently transfected HEK293T cells with FLAG-tagged mouse TET1 CD constructs bearing deletions of each of these regions, some of which failed to express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Because HEK293T cells have low levels of endogenous OGT, we also co-expressed myc-tagged human OGT. TET1 constructs were immunoprecipitated (IPed) using FLAG antibody and analyzed for interaction with OGT. We found that deletion of only the 45 residue C-terminus of TET1 (hereafter TET1 C45) prevented detectable interaction with OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>, TET1 CD del. 4). To exclude the possibility that this result is an artifact of OGT overexpression, we repeated the experiment overexpressing only TET1. TET1 CD, but not TET1 CD &#x0394;C45, interacted with endogenous OGT, confirming that the C45 is necessary for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

<p>OGT has two major domains: the N-terminus consists of 13.5 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein-protein interaction domains, and the C-terminus contains the bilobed catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We made internal deletions of several sets of TPRs to ask which are responsible for binding to the TET1 CD. We co-transfected HEK293T cells with FLAG-TET1 CD and His6-tagged OGT constructs and performed FLAG IP and western blot as above. We found that all the TPR deletions tested impaired the interaction with TET1 CD, with deletion of TPRs 7-9, 10-12, or 13-13.5 being most severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>). This result suggests that all of OGT&#x2019;s TPRs may be involved in binding to the TET1 CD, or that deletion of a set of TPRs disrupts the overall structure of the repeats in a way that disfavors binding.</p>

<title>Conserved residues in the TET1 C45 are necessary for the TET1-OGT interaction</title>
<p>An alignment of the TET1 C45 region with the C-termini of TET2 and TET3 revealed several conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>To determine if the interaction between TET1 CD and OGT is direct, we employed recombinant proteins in pulldown assays using beads conjugated to a TET1 antibody. We found that wild-type rTET1 CD, but not beads alone, pulled down OGT, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). rTET1 CD D2018A did not pull down rOGT, consistent with our mutational analysis in cells.

The D2018A mutation was also sufficient in this context to prevent OGT binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>), consistent with the behavior of this mutant in cells.

<title>TET1 D2018A is active in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>The D2018A mutation lies outside the catalytic fold, suggesting that this mutation is unlikely to affect TET1 activity.

Western blot confirmed that the two proteins were expressed at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Immunostaining for FLAG and 5hmC showed that wild type and D2018A TET1 both exhibited nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). While mock transfected HEK293T cells showed very low levels of 5hmC, consistent with their low expression of TETs and OGT, wild type or D2018A TET1 each caused increased production of 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A slot blot assay on genomic DNA from these cells confirmed that comparable levels of 5hmC were observed in wild type and D2018A TET1 transfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

<title>The TET-OGT interaction promotes Tet1 function in the zebrafish embryo</title>
<p>We used zebrafish as a model system to ask whether the D2018A mutation affects TET function during development.

Deletion of both <italic>tet2</italic> and <italic>tet3</italic> (<italic>tet2/3<sup>DM</sup></italic>) causes a severe decrease in 5hmC levels accompanied by larval stage lethality owing to a number of abnormalities including defects in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) production.

<title>OGT stimulation of TET activity</title>
<p>Our results show for the first time that OGT stimulates the activity of a TET protein <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<p>Our data demonstrate that OGT stimulates TET1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and are consistent with a role for OGT in TET1 regulation <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. OGT also directly interacts with TET2 and TET3, suggesting that it may regulate all three TET proteins. Notably, although all three TETs possess highly similar catalytic folds and the same catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, they show a number of differences that are likely to determine their biological role. Different TET proteins are expressed in different cell types and at different stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. TET1 and TET2 appear to target different genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and to promote different pluripotent states in mESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The mechanisms responsible for these differences are not well understood. We suggest that OGT is a strong candidate for regulation of TET enzymes.</p>

<title>A unique OGT interaction domain?</title>
<p>We identified a 45-amino acid domain of TET1 that is both necessary and sufficient for binding of OGT. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a small protein domain has been identified that confers stable binding to OGT. The vast majority of OGT targets do not bind to OGT tightly enough to be detected in co-IP experiments, suggesting that OGT&#x2019;s interaction with TET proteins is unusually strong. For determination of the crystal structure of the human TET2 catalytic domain in complex with DNA, the corresponding C-terminal region had to be deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], suggesting that it may be unstructured. When bound to OGT this domain may become structured, and structural studies of OGT bound to C45 could shed light on what features make this domain uniquely able to interact stably with OGT and how OGT may stimulate TET1 activity.</p>
<p>An alternative or additional role for the stable TET-OGT interaction may be recruitment of OGT to chromatin by TET proteins. Loss of TET1 causes loss of OGT from chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and induces similar changes in transcription in both wild-type mESCs and mESCs lacking DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. This raises the possibility that TET proteins may recruit OGT to chromatin to regulate gene expression independent of 5mC oxidation. Consistent with this possibility, OGT modifies many transcription factors and chromatin regulators in mESCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>](<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus it may be that the stable OGT-TET1 interaction promotes both regulation of TET1 activity by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation as well as recruitment of OGT to chromatin. Notably, our results show that TET1 D2018A does not rescue 5hmC levels in <italic>tet2/3<sup>DM</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos to the same extent as the wild type protein, suggesting that at least part of the role of the OGT-TET1 interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> is regulation of TET1 activity.</p>

In addition to TET1, OGT can directly interact with TET2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and HCF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and TET2 co-IPs with TET1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Given the robust inhibition of the OGT-TET1 interaction by the D2018A mutation in multiple other contexts, our data are consistent with a scenario in which the D2018A mutation disrupts the direct interaction between OGT and TET1 in mESCs. However, some OGT remains associated in a co-IP assay through interactions with TET2 and/or HCF1. It is also possible that OGT interacts with the N-terminus of TET1, so that the D2018A mutation cripples but does not prevent the interaction with full-length TET1. This scenario is unlikely, however, since multiple studies have failed to identify any OGT binding capability outside the catalytic domains of TETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>

<title>A connection between metabolism and the epigenome</title>

<p>A) Schematic of mESC lines. DNA encoding a 3xFLAG tag was added to the 3&#x2019; end of both alleles of <italic>Tet1</italic>, followed by a 2A sequence and a fluorescent protein (GFP or tdTomato). The 2A sequence causes ribosome skipping, resulting in separate translation of TET1-3xFLAG and 2A-GFP or 2A-tdTomato. Purple line: template used for homology-directed repair (HDR). Horizontal arrows: primers used for PCR genotyping. Vertical arrows: D2018 residue. B) PCR genotyping of independently derived, clonal, targeted mESC lines using primers indicated in A. C) FLAG and OGT western blot of inputs and FLAG IPs from a second set of mESC lines in which a FLAG tag or a FLAG tag and the D2018A mutation were introduced into both copies of <italic>Tet1</italic>.</p>
