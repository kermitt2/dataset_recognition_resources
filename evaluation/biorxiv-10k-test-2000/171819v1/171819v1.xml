<p>Three-dimensional organization of chromosomes is being defined at ever-increasing resolution through the use of Hi-C and related high-throughput methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Genome organization can also be analyzed in live cells by fluorescence imaging, especially via fluorescent protein (FP) fusions to nuclease-dead <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (dSpyCas9), which can be directed to nearly any genomic region via single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. It has proven more difficult to map subnuclear proteomes onto 3-D genome landscapes in a comprehensive manner that avoids demanding fractionation protocols, specific DNA-associated protein fusions [e.g. in proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>)], or validated antibodies. dSpyCas9 has enabled a BioID-derived subnuclear proteomic technique called CasID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, in which biotin ligase (BirA<sup>&#x2217;</sup>) fusion to dSpyCas9 allows proteins associated with specific genomic regions to be biotinylated on neighboring, exposed lysine residues in live cells. Streptavidin affinity selection and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is then used to identify the tagged proteins. However, this approach is relatively inefficient and requires long (18-24h) labeling times, leading to increased background levels and limited time resolution of dynamic processes.</p>
<p>Engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) has been used for an alternative live-cell biotinylation strategy called spatially restricted enzymatic tagging (SRET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In this approach, APEX2 is fused to a localized protein of interest, and cells are then treated with biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, generating a localized (within a &#x007E;20nm radius) burst of diffusible but rapidly quenched biotin-phenoxyl radicals. These products react with electron-rich amino acid side chains (e.g. Tyr, Trp, His and Cys), leading to covalent biotinylation of proteins in the vicinity of the localized APEX2, thus allowing subsequent identification by streptavidin selection and LC-MS/MS. Notably, this subcellular tagging method is extremely efficient (1 min H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment), allowing temporal control over the labeling process. Based in part on the success of dSpyCas9-FP fusions in enabling subnuclear imaging in living cells, we reasoned that a dSpyCas9 derivative that emits radicals rather than photons could be used for subnuclear proteomic analyses in a manner that overcomes the unfavorable kinetics and high background of CasID. Here we use dSpyCas9-APEX2 fusions in the development of C-BERST (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>) for genomic element-specific profiling of subnuclear proteomes in live cells.</p>

<p>Using C-BERST to biotinylate telomere-associated proteins in living human cells. (<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of the C-BERST workflow. U2OS cells stably expressing sgRNA and inducible dSpyCas9-APEX2 are generated by lentiviral transduction. Following dox and Shield1 induction (21 h), cells are incubated with biotin-phenol (BP, 30 min) and then H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1 min) to activate a burst of biotin-phenoxyl radical generation by dSpyCas9-APEX2, leading to proximity-labeling of nearby proteins. Following quenching, nuclei isolation and protein extraction, biotinylated proteins are enriched by streptavidin selection and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

<p>To develop and validate this method, we sought genomic elements that are associated with a well-defined suite of known protein factors, and that can be bound with dSpyCas9 with high efficiency and specificity using an established sgRNA. For this purpose, we chose to target telomeres in human U2OS cells. As with &#x2212;10-15&#x0025; of cancer cell types, U2OS cells rely on alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathways to maintain telomere length without telomerase activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Cohorts of proteins associated with telomeres in ALT&#x002B; cells are well-characterized and map to key pathways such as homologous recombination (HR) and break-induced telomere synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, an sgRNA (sgTelo) has already been established for efficient telomere association of dSpyCas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We transduced U2OS cells with a lentiviral vector expressing dSpyCas9 under the control of a tet-on CMV promoter and fused to five nuclear localization signals (NLSs), a ligand-tunable degradation domain (DD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, mCherry, and APEX2 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Maximal expression of this dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 fusion protein requires not only doxycycline (dox) but also the Shield1 ligand to inactivate the DD in a dose-dependent fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This combination allows precise control over dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 protein levels for optimal signal-to-noise levels. mCherry-positive cells [collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)] were then transduced with a separate lentiviral vector that included an sgRNA construct (driven by the U6 promoter) as well as a blue fluorescent protein (BFP) construct that also expresses the TetR repressor (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). In one version of this construct the sgRNA cassette encodes sgTelo (for labeling telomeres), and in the other it encodes a non-specific sgRNA (sgNS) that is complementary to a bacteriophage-derived sequence that is absent from the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. After 21h of dox and Shield1 induction, we again used fluorescence-activated sorting (FACS) to sort four distinct BFP/mCherry double-positive cell populations (P1-P4) that correlate with different expression levels of dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX and BFP (as a surrogate for sgRNA and TetR) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). We reasoned that our signal-to-noise ratio of telomeric vs. non-telomeric biotinylation would be maximized when sgTelo levels are saturating, and when dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 levels are limiting (relative to potential genomic binding sites). Both conditions are expected to favor maximal partitioning of the sgRNA-programmed dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX into the desired telomere-associated state, with as little unlocalized or mislocalized fusion protein as possible. Visual inspection by fluorescence microscopy (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>) confirmed that the sgTelo P1 cell population (with higher BFP expression and lower mCherry expression) exhibited the most robust mCherry-labelled telomeric foci with the lowest amount of nucleolar or diffuse nucleoplasmic background<sup>9</sup>. We therefore used this population in our subsequent experiments. Diffuse nucleoplasmic labeling, as opposed to distinct foci, was observed in the sgNS P1 population (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). APEX2-catalyzed biotinylation of nucleoplasmic proteins in the sgNS control sample serves as a reference, permitting an assessment of the telomere specificity of labeling in the sgTelo sample.</p>
<p>We induced APEX2-catalyzed biotinylation with biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the sgTelo and sgNS P1 cells, and also included an sgTelo control in which the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was omitted. Nuclei were isolated from these cells (to reduce cytoplasmic background), and nuclear proteins were then extracted. Recovered proteins (50 &#x03BC;g) were subjected to western analysis using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (streptavidin-HRP) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>), as well as total protein visualization by Coomassie staining (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). Samples were also probed with anti-mCherry antibodies (to detect dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2) and HDAC1 (as a loading control) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>, bottom). Biotinylated proteins were readily detected in both sgTelo and sgNS samples, but were largely absent in the -H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> control (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). In the sgNS sample, anti-mCherry and streptavidin-HRP signals were less intense in comparison with the sgTelo sample, indicating that dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 accumulation and activity are lower in the former. Biotinylated proteins were then isolated using streptavidin beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref></bold>). Aside from the &#x007E;75kDa endogenously biotinylated proteins routinely detected in SRET-labeled samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, only background levels of proteins were detected in the no-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> control sample, indicating successful purification. All three samples were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS to identify the biotin-labeled proteins. These analyses were done with two biological replicates prepared on different days.</p>
<p>The two sgTelo replicates yielded at least two unique peptides from 1,106 and 958 proteins, &#x003E;80&#x0025; of which (876) were detected in both. For these 876 proteins, we used intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values to determine the degree of enrichment in the sgTelo sample relative to the sgNS sample. Some of these 876 proteins (140 in the first replicate, and 403 in the second) yielded no spectra whatsoever in the corresponding sgNS sample, consistent with sgTelo specificity. In those cases, to avoid infinitely large sgTelo/sgNS enrichment scores, we assigned those proteins the smallest non-zero iBAQ value from the proteins positively identified in that sgNS dataset. The sgTelo/sgNS iBAQ ratios were then analyzed by moderated t-test, yielding 192 proteins whose enrichment in sgTelo was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) [<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold> (red and blue dots) and <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>]. Strikingly, the six subunits of the shelterin complex (a telomere-binding complex that protects ends from chromosome fusion<sup>14</sup>) were the six most significantly enriched proteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Another highly enriched protein was Apollo, a 5&#x2019;<bold>&#x2192;</bold>3&#x2019; exonuclease that interacts with the shelterin component TRF2 and functions in the ALT pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Overall, among the 192 most significantly sgTelo-enriched proteins (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>), 32 have been reported previously to be associated with telomeres or linked to telomere function (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). These include proteins from complexes known to contribute to ALT-associated pathways or processes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 192 C-BERST proteomic hits reveals strong functional associations with terms such as telomere maintenance, DNA replication, DNA repair, and homologous recombination, all of which are important for ALT pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Telomere-associated proteomes from ALT&#x002B; cell lines have been defined previously by TRF1-BirA&#x2217; BioID in U2OS cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and by biochemical purification [proteomics of isolated chromatin segments (PICh)] from WI38-VA13 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Protein identifications from these analyses, as well as from our C-BERST dataset, were examined for overlap as depicted in the Venn diagram shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>. Of the 192 proteins identified by C-BERST, 74 (&#x007E;38&#x0025;) were also detected by one or both of the other methods [62 by BioID (<italic>p</italic> = 7.02 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-56</sup>), 31 by PICh (<italic>p</italic> = 1.58 &#x00D7; 10<sup>-30</sup>), and 19 by both]. Of the 19 proteins detected by all three approaches (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>), 17 are among the top third of the 192 most significant C-BERST hits based on sgTelo/sgNS enrichment, and 16 are known telomere-related factors. The remaining three of the nineteen proteins identified by PICh, BioID and now C-BERST [nitric oxide synthase-interacting protein (NOSIP), SLX4-interacting protein (SLX4IP), and core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFB) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>)] appear likely to have previously unappreciated roles as telomere-associated factors.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that C-BERST successfully maps subnuclear proteomes associated with genomic landmarks. Using the extensively investigated ALT telomeric proteome as a benchmark, we recover approximately 41&#x0025; of known ALT-associated proteins (32 of 78, <bold>Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</bold>), as well as factors involved in all reported biological processes that contribute to ALT. By combining the flexibility of RNA-guided dSpyCas9 genome binding with the efficiency and rapid kinetics of APEX2-catalyzed biotinylation, C-BERST promises to extend the unbiased definition of subnuclear proteomes to many genomic elements, and to a range of dynamic processes (e.g. cellular differentiation, responses to extracellular stimuli, and cell cycle progression) that occur too rapidly to analyze via the 18-24h labeling procedures inherent to CasID. Importantly, C-BERST promises to augment and extend Hi-C and related methods by linking conformationally important cis-elements with the factors that associate with them. Our initial implementation of C-BERST focused on minimizing the background labeling catalyzed by un- or mis-localized dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2, mostly by optimizing its expression level relative to that of its sgRNA. This method is amenable to further improvements including isotope labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> or tandem mass tagging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> that will enable ratiometric assessments of differential biotinylation when dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 is guided by specific vs. non-specific sgRNAs. Such improvements, in conjunction with sgRNA multiplexing, may prove to be important for applying C-BERST to the definition of subnuclear proteomes associated with non-repetitive loci. In the meantime, many types of repetitive elements within the genome, like telomeres, play critically important roles in chromosome maintenance and function in ways that depend upon associated proteins; C-BERST provides an unbiased method for sampling subnuclear, locus-specific proteomics at these elements to define protein factors critical to the functions of these elements.</p>

<title>ONLINE METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Construction of C-BERST plasmids</title>
<p>The Shield1- and doxycycline-inducible dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 construct was made by subcloning Flag-APEX2 from Flag-APEX2-NES (Addgene 49386) into DD-dSpyCas9-mCherry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> using the pHAGE backbone. Two NLSs (SV40 and nucleoplasmin NLS) were inserted at each terminus to improve nuclear localization. The sequence of the final plasmid is provided in the <bold>Supplementary Note</bold>. The sgTelo-encoding construct was created by replacing the C3-guide RNA sequence (pCMV_C3-sgRNA_2XBroccoli/pPGK_TetR_P2A_BFP) with sgTelo sequences (using a plasmid provided by Hanhui Ma and Thoru Pederson). Non-specific sgRNA (sgNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> was used similarly to create the analogous sgNS construct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell culture and cell line construction</title>
<p>Human U2OS cells obtained from Thoru Pederson&#x2019;s lab (originally obtained from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco-modified Eagle&#x2019;s Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10&#x0025; (vol/vol) FBS (Sigma). Lentiviral transduction was as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Six-fold higher titers of sgRNA-encoding lentiviruses were used for transduction relative to dSpyCas9-APEX2 lentivirus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>One day before performing FACS, dox (Sigma; 2 &#x03BC;g/ml) and Shield1 (Clontech; 250 nM) were added to the media. Cells expressing dSpyCas9-mCherry-APEX2 and BFP sgRNA were selected by FACSAria cell sorter or analyzed with MacsQuant<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> VYB. Both instruments are equipped with 405- and 561-nm excitation lasers, and the emission signals were detected by using filters at 450/50 nm (wavelength/bandwidth) for BFP, and 610/20 nm (FACSAria) or 615/20nm (MacsQuant) for mCherry. Bulk population and single cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref></bold>) were sorted into plates containing 1&#x0025; GlutaMAX, 20&#x0025; FBS, and 1&#x0025; penicillin/streptomycin in DMEM medium.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>U2OS cells expressing sgRNA were seeded onto 170 &#x03BC;m, 35 &#x00D7; 10 mm glass-bottom dishes (Eppendorf) supplemented with dox and Shield1 21 hours before imaging. Live cells were imaged with a Leica DMi8 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu camera (C11440-22CU), a 63x oil objective lens, and Microsystems software (LASX). Further imaging processing was done with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). Image contrast was set to ease visualization of cell, foci and nucleoplasmic background.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>C-BERST biotinylation protocol</title>
<p>Six 15cm plates of U2OS cells expressing sgTelo or sgNS were used in this assay. Dox (2 &#x03BC;g/ml) and Shield1 (250 nM) were added 21 hours before biotinylation. Cells were then incubated with 500 &#x03BC;M biotin-phenol (BP) (Adipogen) for 30 minutes at 37&#x00B0;C. 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was then added to initiate of biotinylation for 1 minute on a horizontal shaker at room temperature. Six 15cm plates of sgTelo-expressing cells were treated in parallel, but without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition, as a negative control. Quencher solution (5 mM trolox, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 10 mM sodium azide) was added to stop the reaction, and cells were washed five times (three quencher washes and two DPBS washes) to continue the quench and to remove excess BP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Enrichment of biotinylated proteins</title>
<p>Cells were scraped off the plates and used for the preparation of isolated nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Nuclei were washed with DPBS before lysis. RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.125&#x0025; SDS, 0.125&#x0025; sodium deoxycholate and 1&#x0025; Triton X-100 in Millipore water) with 1x freshly supplemented Halt Protease Inhibitor were used to lyse the cells for 10 minutes on ice. Cell lysates in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes were sonicated for 15 minutes with a Diagenode Bioruptor with 30s on/off cycles at high intensity. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Clarified protein samples (&#x007E;3.5 mg) were subjected to 400 &#x03BC;l Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 affinity purification overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. Each bead sample was washed with a series of buffers to remove non-specifically bound proteins: twice with RIPA lysis buffer, once with 1 M KCl, once with 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, once with 2 M urea in 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and twice with RIPA lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted in 70 &#x03BC;l 3x protein loading buffer supplemented with 2 mM biotin and 20 mM DTT with heating for 10min at 95&#x00B0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. 50 &#x03BC;l eluents were loaded and run on a 4-12&#x0025; SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and run approximately 1cm off the loading well for in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by BCA assay (Thermo). 50 ug of each sample was mixed with protein loading buffer, boiled, and separated in SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore), and blotted with Streptavidin-HRP (Thermo), or with anti-mCherry (Abcam) or anti-HDACl (Bethyl) antibodies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>LC-MS/MS and proteomic analyses</title>
<p>Unresolved protein bands from SDS-PAGE were cut into l&#x00D7;l mm pieces and placed in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes with 1ml of water. After 30 min, water was removed and replaced with 70 &#x03BC;l of 250 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were then reduced by the addition of 20 &#x03BC;l of 45 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, incubated at 50&#x00B0;C for 30 min, cooled to room temperature, alkylated with 20 &#x03BC;l of 100 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min, and washed twice with 1 ml water. The water was removed and replaced with 1 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate: acetonitrile (1:1) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The solvent was then replaced with 200 &#x03BC;l acetonitrile, removed, and the pieces dried in a Speed Vac. Gel pieces were then rehydrated in 75 &#x03BC;l of 4 ng/&#x03BC;l sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) in 0.01&#x0025; ProteaseMAX Surfactant (Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 21 hr. The supernatant was then removed to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, the gel pieces further dehydrated with 100 pl of acetonitrile: 1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid (4:1), and the combined supernatants dried on a Speed Vac. Peptides were then reconstituted in 25 &#x03BC;l of 5&#x0025; acetonitrile containing 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid for LC-MS/MS.</p>
<p>Samples were analyzed on a NanoAcquity UPLC (Waters Corporation) coupled to a Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific) hybrid mass spectrometer. In brief, 1.0 &#x03BC;l aliquots were loaded at 4 &#x03BC;l/min onto a custom-packed fused silica precolumn (100 &#x03BC;m ID) with Kasil frit containing 2 cm Magic C18AQ (5&#x03BC;, 100&#x00C5;) particles (Bruker Corporation). Peptides were then separated on a 75&#x03BC;m ID fused silica analytical column containing 25 cm Magic C18AQ (3&#x03BC;m, 100&#x00C5;) particles (Bruker) packed in-house into a gravity-pulled tip. Peptides were eluted at 300 nl/min with a linear gradient from 95&#x0025; solvent A (0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid in water) to 35&#x0025; solvent B (0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile) in 60 min. Data was acquired by data-dependent acquisition according to a published method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Briefly, MS scans were acquired from <italic>m/z</italic> 300-1750 at a resolution of 70,000 (<italic>m/z</italic> 200) and followed by ten tandem mass spectrometry scans using HCD fragmentation using an isolation width of 1.6 Da, a collision energy of 27&#x0025;, and a resolution of 17,500 (<italic>m/z</italic> 200). Raw data files were processed with Proteome Discoverer (Thermo, version 2.1.1.21) and searched with Mascot (Matrix Science, version 2.6) against the SwissProt <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> database. Search parameters used tryptic specificity considering up to 2 missed cleavages, a parent mass tolerance of 10 ppm, and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.05 Da. Fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine was considered as were variable modifications of N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal conversion of Gln to pyroGlu, oxidation of methionine, and biotin-phenol conjugation of tyrosine. Results were loaded into Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc., version 4.8.2) for peptide and protein validation and quantitation using the Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The threshold for peptides was set to 70&#x0025; (1.1&#x0025; FDR) and 90&#x0025; for proteins (2-peptide minimum). Contaminants such as human keratin were included in all statistical analyses and removed from the figures.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data was first filtered to exclude proteins detected in only one of the S1 replicates, followed by log2 transformation. Prior to the log2 transformation, iBAQ values of 0 were replaced with the smallest iBAQ value from the corresponding sample in S2 or S3 to avoid generation of infinite ratios. Moderated t-test with a paired design was used to compare the log2 transformed iBAQ values between S1 and S3, S1 and S2, and S2 and S3 using limma package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To adjust for multiple comparisons, <italic>p</italic> values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Proteins with BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant. Proteins were selected for subsequent GO (David Bioinformatics) and overlap analysis if they were (<italic>i</italic>) significantly enriched in both S1 vs. S3 and S1 vs. S2, (<italic>ii</italic>) not enriched in S2 vs. S3, and (<italic>iii</italic>) if S1/S3 and S1/S2 ratios were greater than 2. To determine whether the proteins identified in this experiment overlap significantly with two published datasets, a hypergeometric test was used.</p>
