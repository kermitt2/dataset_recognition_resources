<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The arrangement of neurons into distinct layers is critical for neuronal connectivity and function of the nervous system. During development, most neurons move from their birthplace to the appropriate layer, where they polarize. However, kinetics and modes of many neuronal translocation events still await exploration. Here, we investigate ganglion cell (RGC) translocation across the embryonic zebrafish retina. After completing their translocation, RGCs establish the most basal retinal layer where they form the optic nerve. Using <italic>in toto</italic> light sheet microscopy, we show that somal translocation of RGCs is a fast and directed event. It depends on basal process attachment and stabilized microtubules. Interestingly, interference with somal translocation induces a switch to multipolar migration. This multipolar mode is less efficient but still leads to successful RGC layer formation. When both modes are inhibited, RGCs that fail to translocate induce lamination defects, indicating that correct RGC translocation is crucial for subsequent retinal lamination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A conserved feature of the central nervous system (CNS) is its stratified organization. The accurate localization of neuronal subtypes into layers is established during development and is critical for the timely formation of connections among particular neurons. It thereby helps to ensure CNS functionality. Since many neurons are born in defined proliferative zones, from which they need to reach their final location, neuronal lamination relies on correct neuronal translocation. Neuronal movements are dynamic and often depend on the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cooper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marin et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, they are best understood by time lapse <italic>in toto</italic> imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Driscoll and Danuser, 2015</xref>). Despite this, insights about neuronal migration have often been generated using fixed tissue or <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cooper, 2013</xref>). This is because many established model systems for studying neuronal migration, e.g. cerebellar granule neurons of rodents, are not easily imaged in intact embryos. Even though <italic>in toto</italic> imaging of neuronal translocation has been achieved in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yanagida et al., 2012</xref>), the applicability of this experimental setup is limited. Consequently, model systems that allow live imaging in intact developing embryos need to be explored and findings there can then be used to understand neuronal translocation events in less accessible parts of the CNS.</p>
<p>The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) is an ideal model system for live imaging approaches due to its small size and translucency at embryonic stages. Part of its CNS, the retina, is located at the surface of the animal, which makes it suitable for studying neuronal translocation and lamination. The retina consists of stereotypical layers of five well-defined neuronal cell types (photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells) and one glial cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cajal, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Galli-Resta et al., 2008</xref>). These layers arise between 30 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf), which means that a single imaging experiment can cover the complete time frame of neurogenesis. However, it is important to choose the right microscope depending on the question asked. Whereas confocal microscopy can induce phototoxicity-related artifacts during zebrafish development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jemielita et al., 2012</xref>) and is usually performed at lower temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Poggi et al., 2005</xref>), light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allows fast, less phototoxic imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huisken et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stelzer, 2015</xref>). Consequently, LSFM is an ideal tool to image the emergence of neuronal layering in the zebrafish retina.</p>
<p>The first neuronal lamination event in the retina is the formation of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer. RGCs are the first retinal neurons born in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cajal, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nawrocki, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sidman, 1961</xref>). Upon their apical birth, RGCs move basally, spanning the complete apico-basal axis towards the lens, where their axons later form the optic nerve. Although it is known that RGCs can translocate by moving their soma while keeping the attachment to both apical and basal sides of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cajal, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hinds and Hinds, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref>), we still lack a thorough analysis of their translocation kinetics and modes. Additionally, the cell biological mechanisms of somal translocation are still unknown, despite the fact that this is a widespread mode of neuronal movement during retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chow et al., 2015</xref>) and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nadarajah et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on high-resolution imaging of single cell behavior, we analyze the kinetics of RGC translocation. We show that RGC somal translocation is an active, directionally persistent process. Speed and directional persistence of somal translocation depend on intact microtubules (MTs) and basal cellular attachment. Interestingly, interference with somal translocation can result in a switch to a multipolar migratory mode, not previously reported for RGCs. The multipolar mode is less efficient, but allows RGCs to reach their correct location. Complete inhibition of RGC movements, however, substantially perturbs lamination of other retinal layers. Thus, our study sheds new light on the mechanisms of and requirements for efficient basal translocation of RGCs and highlights its importance for subsequent retinal lamination.</p>

<title>Rapid RGC translocation is followed by a period of fine positioning</title>
<p>To study the emergence of the RGC layer as well as the kinetics of RGC translocation, we labeled these cells using constructs containing the <italic>ath5 (atonal bHLH transcription factor 7, atoh7</italic>) promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Masai et al., 2003</xref>). Ath5 starts to be expressed during the last cell cycle in a subset of progenitor cells. These progenitors divide apically and produce one RGC and one cell that later gives rise to photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Poggi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">He et al., 2012</xref>). To label and follow RGCs between their apical birth and axonogenesis, we made use of previously published <italic>Tg(ath5:GAP-GFP/RFP)</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref>), which express membrane-targeted GFP or RFP in the <italic>ath5</italic> lineage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Alternatively, to achieve mosaic labeling and follow single RGCs, we injected <italic>ath5</italic> plasmid DNA into one cell stage embryos, typically <italic>ath5:GFP-CAAX</italic> coding for membrane targeted GFP (for example <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1, G&#x2013;I</xref>). We noted that the use of spinning disk microscopy even at low intensity illumination induced a slowing down of RGC translocation compared to a LSFM setup (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1 A</xref>). The two microscope setups differ in the way the sample is mounted and in the amount of light the sample is exposed to during image acquisition. To test the influence of mounting, we compared the viability and development of embryos mounted for LSFM or spinning disk microscopy to non-mounted embryos (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 B</xref>). We observed no change in heart rate or apoptosis (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1, C&#x2013;E</xref>) between the samples, therefore we concluded that the observed differences in RGC translocation speed at different microscopes are likely due to higher phototoxicity induced by spinning disk microscopy. For this reason, we used only LSFM-generated data to analyze RGC translocation kinetics. We confirmed that this technique does not produce noticeable phototoxicity-related artifacts by comparing embryos imaged for 12&#x2013;16 hours in the LSFM to non-imaged controls. In both conditions the RGC layer formed to a similar extent.</p>

<p>Following emerging RGCs by live imaging revealed that RGC translocation was divided into two parts that in total took around 285 min (median, n&#x003D;50 cells N&#x003D;19 experiments) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Initially, cells translocated basally for 115 min (median, n&#x003D;140 N&#x003D;24) in a fast and persistent manner, moving about 28 &#x03BC;m away from the apical side (median, n&#x003D;140 N&#x003D;24) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). After this phase, RGCs exhibited slower, more random movements within the RGC layer in the basal part of the retina for 165 min (median, n&#x003D;50 N&#x003D;19) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1 F</xref>) moving on average additional 3 &#x03BC;m basally. This probably reflects the growth of the retina rather than net cell movement. We termed this second phase fine positioning. It ended with axonogenesis, which we defined as the moment when a persistent growth cone emerged from the RGC. Only during fine positioning, cells lost their apical process, around 60 min before axonogenesis (median, n&#x003D;33 N&#x003D;16), although the exact timing was variable (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 F</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify the kinetics and directional persistence of the two phases of RGC movement, we calculated mean squared displacements (MSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>); (Okamoto et al., 2014) from manually tracked 2D trajectories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). MSD analysis allows determining the directionality of a particle (here the nucleus) from the shape of the MSD curve. A linear curve indicates random motion and a supralinear curve indicates directional motion of the particle. Our MSD analysis showed that the initial basal movement of RGCs was directionally persistent as indicated by the supralinear MSD and the &#x03B1; value of 1.60&#x00B1;0.09 from fitting the MSDs with 2D<sub>&#x0394;</sub>t<sup>&#x03B1;</sup> (see Materials and Methods). In contrast, MSDs of cells undergoing fine positioning showed an almost linear relationship with time with an &#x03B1; value of 1.32&#x00B1;0.09 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), indicating random motion. We also calculated the directionality ratio of the trajectories. Here, values close to 1 indicate high directionality and values approaching 0 indicate random motion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). This analysis confirmed that initial basal translocation is much more directed than fine positioning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). RGCs in the directional phase moved with a median instantaneous velocity of 0.26 &#x03BC;m/min (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 A</xref>). This was calculated from 1D apico-basal displacement, where a positive sign was assigned to basalward movement and a negative sign to apicalward movement. Median instantaneous velocity of fine positioning was close to 0 (0.02 &#x03BC;m/min), as expected for a cell undergoing random motion (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 A</xref>). We conclude that RGC translocation to the basal side of the retina before RGC layer formation consists of a directional and a fine positioning phase.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Basal movement of RGC and progenitor nuclei is more efficient when cells inherit the basal process</title>
<p>So far, our analysis showed that initial RGC translocation is directionally persistent. Two scenarios could explain how this directionality arises: a) RGCs are displaced basally by the surrounding progenitor nuclei undergoing directed apical migration, as suggested for the gradual basal displacement of progenitor cell nuclei in the proliferative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Norden et al., 2009</xref>); or b) RGC movements are driven cell autonomously and occur independently of the movements within surrounding cells.</p>
<p>To test option a), we stalled cells in S-phase using a combination of Aphidicolin and Hydroxyurea (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). We started cell cycle inhibition at 32 hpf, when the first pool of RGCs has been born and co-inhabits the retina together with an abundant pool of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kay, 2005</xref>). Apical migration of nuclei in these progenitor cells relies on progression through the cell cycle and has been shown to be stalled in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). RGCs were either analyzed live (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>) or fixed at 48 hpf, when the RGC layer was fully formed in control embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Inhibition of proliferation was confirmed by the lack of anti-phosphorylated histone H3 staining in drug-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). We noted that migration of RGCs still occurred (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>) and although the eyes of treated embryos were overall smaller, the RGC layer still formed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). This indicated that RGC translocation depended on cell intrinsic processes. Various active modes of neuronal displacement are driven by the concerted action of the centrosome and associated Golgi apparatus. For example, it was shown that during glial guided neuronal migration the centrosome leads the translocation process and pulls the nucleus via a MT cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Solecki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bellion et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). However, it was previously suggested that in RGCs the centrosome remains in the apical process during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hinds and Hinds, 1974</xref>). To analyze how centrosome and Golgi behave during RGC displacement, we used Centrin-tdTomato as a centrosomal marker and the trans-Golgi marker GalT-RFP. Live imaging showed that both structures remain in the apical process during somal translocation and only follow the nucleus towards more basal positions once the apical process is retracted during the fine positioning phase in all cells followed (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 G</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1 I</xref>). Similar observations were made for the primary cilium marked by Arl13b-mKate2 in all cells followed (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lepanto et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that these organelles do not actively lead nucleokinesis and somal translocation in RGCs.</p>
<p>Given that RGC displacement was not triggered by movement within surrounding cells and was not driven by a centrosome based mechanism, we turned our attention to the basal process as a guide for RGC translocation. In the mouse cerebral cortex, the inheritance of the basal process has been shown to streamline basal displacement of progenitor cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Okamoto et al., 2013</xref>). We thus investigated how basal process inheritance correlates with RGC displacement kinetics. Interestingly, the basal process was inherited preferentially by the RGC in 78&#x0025; of divisions (n&#x003D;109/140). In the remaining 22&#x0025; RGCs regrew the basal process later during their translocation. Translocation kinetics of RGCs inheriting the basal process was faster than for RGCs that had to regrow it (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2 A</xref>). As seen in representative trajectories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; more trajectories in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2, F</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), RGCs not inheriting the basal process (n&#x003D;31/140 cells) moved basally more slowly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). The higher directional persistence of RGCs inheriting the basal process was apparent from MSDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 A</xref>), directionality ratios (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 J</xref>) and instantaneous velocity distributions (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 C</xref>). Even though the cells not inheriting the basal process took longer to reach basal positions (165 vs. 105 min, median) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 E</xref>), the time interval between their apical birth and axonogenesis was comparable to the timing in cells inheriting the process (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2, D</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>

<p>Retinal progenitors share many morphological similarities with RGCs. Thus, we hypothesized that a positive effect of basal process inheritance on basal nuclear displacement might also exist after apical progenitor divisions. While it was previously reported that basal displacement of retinal progenitor nuclei fits the characteristics of a random walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Norden et al., 2009</xref>), these analyses did not discriminate between progenitors with or without a basal process. To test whether progenitors show different kinetics of basal nuclear translocation depending on whether they inherit the basal process, we analyzed them by labeling with the nuclear marker PCNA-GFP and mKate2-ras to mark membranes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Velocities by which nuclei of sister cells moved away from the apical side differed in all instances followed (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 C</xref>). The faster nucleus of the pair also consistently showed higher directional persistence and directionality ratio (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, H-J</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 B</xref>). These nuclei were followed for the first 70 minutes after cell division, before they entered a more stochastic movement mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). The trajectories of the sister nuclei (n&#x003D;68 pairs N&#x003D;7) moving away from the apical side differed in all instances followed (see examples in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). One of the nuclei consistently showed higher directional persistence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 B</xref>), directionality ratio (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 J</xref>) and instantaneous velocity distributions (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 C</xref>). In almost all (16/17) cases in which we could confidently assign basal process inheritance to one of the progenitors, the faster and more directionally persistent nucleus belonged to the progenitor cell that inherited the basal process. Nevertheless, in comparison to RGCs the movement of nuclei in progenitors was less directional and slower (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">J</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2 A&#x2013;C</xref>). Overall, these data indicate that basal process inheritance is an important factor for efficient basal nuclear translocation in RGCs as well as in progenitors. The fact that nuclear displacement in progenitors is slower than RGC displacement suggests that RGC translocation involves additional components.</p>

<title>Interference with basal process attachment impairs basal RGC movement</title>
<p>As basal process inheritance streamlined basal RGC movement, we tested how interference with basal process attachment to the basal lamina affects RGC translocation. To achieve this, we initially interfered with the basal lamina itself. The basal lamina consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins with Laminin &#x03B1;1 being a core component (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Randlett et al., 2011b</xref>). The knock down of <italic>laminin &#x03B1;1</italic> using a published morpholino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Randlett et al., 2011b</xref>) depleted Laminin from the basal retinal membrane (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 B</xref>) and RGCs in this condition lost their basal process, which led to defective translocation and little net movement towards the basal side (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 C</xref>). However, laminin depletion can have diverse effects on late retinal formation (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Randlett et al., 2011b</xref>). Therefore, we additionally interfered with basal RGC attachment by targeting the basal actin pools, which are associated with focal adhesion and ensure cellular attachment to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Randlett et al., 2011a</xref>). We used the Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK-666 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nolen et al., 2009</xref>) and the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Rockout. Arp2/3 inhibition has recently been shown to disrupt basal attachment of radial glia cells in the mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We determined the necessary inhibitor concentrations at which the basal actin was reduced while actin associated with apical adherens junctions was still present (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3, D</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). In both treatments this led to basal process detachment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). In these conditions, RGCs did not stably reattach their basal process after their final apical division and did not persistently move basally (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). In contrast, apical staining in corneal cells, where analysis is easier due to their bigger apical surface, Rockout treatment did not show major effects on cortical actin and microridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lam et al., 2015</xref>) while CK-666 treatment led to a disarray of microridges and apical area reduction (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 F</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the long-term effects of these inhibitors on RGC displacement, we stained RGCs with a Zn5 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trevarrow et al., 1990</xref>) at 48 hpf, 16 hours after drug addition. Zn5 antibody labels differentiated RGCs independent of their location. In both conditions, ectopic RGCs were observed in the middle of the retina while in control retinas Zn5-positive RGCs had formed a compact layer at the basal side (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B&#x2013;D</xref>). This means that cells differentiated into RGCs in time, even when they did not reach the most basal retinal layer. To substantiate our findings in the drug conditions and exclude pleiotropic effects we additionally used a genetic approach. We overexpressed a C-terminal domain of Arp2/3 complex activator N-WASP (NWASP-CA). This truncated protein binds the Arp2/3 complex, but does not activate it and thus acts as dominant negative that inhibits Arp2/3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rohatgi et al., 1999</xref>) similarly to the CK-666 drug. Also this approach affected the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 F</xref>) and led to RGC translocation defects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G&#x2013;J</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4 H</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, discussed below), confirming that indeed the specific disruption of basal process attachment leads to impaired RGC translocation.</p>

<title>Efficient RGC movement depends on a stabilized microtubule cytoskeleton</title>
<p>As we observed that basal displacement is more efficient for RGCs than for progenitor cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>), we asked which additional components could play a role in nuclear translocation of RGCs. An attractive candidate was the MT cytoskeleton, which is involved in many modes of neuronal translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Umeshima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Solecki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cooper, 2013</xref>). To test how MTs behave during RGC translocation, we first compared their growth dynamics in RGCs and progenitors by using the plus tip marker End-binding protein 3 (EB3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). EB3 follows the plus tips of MTs, which allows for measurement of MT growth rate. The moving EB3 dots are termed &#x2018;comets&#x2019;. In both, progenitors and RGCs, the vast majority of EB3 comets emanated from the apical centrosome and moved basally as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Norden et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Notably, MT growth was faster in progenitors (0.23 &#x03BC;m/s, vs. 0.13 &#x03BC;m/s, median) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), demonstrating that there are differences in the MT growth rates between these two cell types. The slower comet speed in the RGCs was indicative of a more stabilized, less dynamic MT cytoskeleton in these cells. To test this idea, we stained embryos with anti-acetylated tubulin antibody as a read-out for MT stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">LeDizet and Piperno, 1986</xref>). Additionally, all MTs were labeled with Doublecortin <italic>Tg(bactin:GFP-DCX)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Distel et al., 2010</xref>), a MT-associated protein. We found that apical processes of translocating RGCs were rich in acetylated tubulin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) unlike the apical processes of progenitor cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), which is in line with the slower EB3 comets in RGCs. To understand the emergence of these stabilized MTs, we examined them live in RGCs using <italic>ath5</italic> promoter-driven Doublecortin <italic>ath5:GFP-DCX</italic>. MTs became enriched in the apical process shortly after cell division and remained there during the whole translocation process (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), as suggested before analysing electron microscopy images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hinds and Hinds, 1974</xref>).</p>

<p>We thus asked whether these apical MTs are important for RGC displacement using the MT depolymerizing drug colcemid. The drug was added at 32 hpf and Zn5 antibody staining was performed 16 hours later. The experiment revealed that many RGCs were retained at mid-retinal positions in drug-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>), while control RGCs formed a compact basal layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). This suggested that MT depolymerization indeed interferes with RGC movement. To corroborate this finding and interfere with MT stability in single cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a construct to overexpress the MT destabilizing protein Stathmin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jourdain et al., 1997</xref>) under the control of heat shock promoter (<italic>hsp70</italic>) to obtain temporal control. We confirmed that Stathmin overexpression led to MT depolymerization in the <italic>Tg(bactin:GFP-DCX)</italic> line (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 A</xref>). Embryos were injected with a <italic>hsp70:Stathmin1-mKate2</italic> plasmid, heat shocked at 24 hpf (to observe progenitor behavior) or 30 hpf (to observe RGC behavior) and imaged starting 4 hours after heat shock. Stathmin overexpression had no effect on progenitor cell behavior. These cells kept their bipolar morphology and interkinetic nuclear migration still occurred (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 D</xref>). On the other hand, RGCs lost their basal process after apical division (while keeping the apical process) initially leading to a compromised movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>, n&#x003D;22 N&#x003D;5, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This initial loss of the basal process could be due to the fact that less MTs are present here and that these MTs were not acetylated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). In many cases, movement of RGCs was less directional than in the control situation as movement back towards the apical side often followed initial basal movement so that the net displacement of cells was marginal (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 E</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, before apical process loss). This behavior could stem from the fact that apical MTs usually block nuclear movements back to apical positions. The strength of the observed phenotype correlated with the strength of Stathmin overexpression (data not shown).</p>

<title>RGCs can switch to a multipolar migratory mode upon disturbance of MTs or Arp2/3 inhibition</title>
<p>We showed that stabilized MTs in the apical process and maintenance of the attachment of the basal process to the ECM are important factors for efficient RGC translocation. However, in both conditions we noted that, although a significant number of cells were observed at ectopic locations, many RGCs still reached the basal side (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). We thus asked how and when RGC movement took place in case the MT cytoskeleton or basal process attachment was compromised. In the control scenario, RGCs were observed to lose their basal process in very rare cases. These cells subsequently detached their apical process, increased their protrusive activity and moved basally in a multipolar migratory mode (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To test whether a comparable switch to multipolar migration could also be observed for RGCs upon interference with MT stability, we imaged Stathmin overexpressing cells for 12&#x2013;16 hours. In this experimental setup Stathmin overexpression led to depletion of acetylated microtubules as shown by antibody staining (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 B</xref>). As noted before, cells initially kept their apical process and did not generate much net movement towards basal positions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). Upon continued imaging, however, cells lost their apical attachment about 200 min after apical division (n&#x003D;20 N&#x003D;5, median). After that point, these cells switched to a multipolar migratory mode (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) as seen for the rare control examples. These multipolar cells lost polarity, as shown by random positioning of the MT-organizing center (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 C</xref>). Once multipolar migration started, instantaneous velocities increased (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 E</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Multipolar migration was directionally persistent, as shown by supralinear MSDs of the multipolar mode with an &#x03B1; value of 1.53&#x00B1;0.03 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). However, it was not as efficient as somal translocation of RGCs inheriting the basal process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>) as also seen in the directionality ratio (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Similar observations were made upon Arp2/3 inhibition by CK-666 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Upon drug treatment, RGCs first lost their basal process and later their apical process and translocated via the multipolar mode (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Also after overexpressing NWASP-CA we observed RGCs that fell into the multipolar mode of translocation to reach basal positions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>, n&#x003D;18 N&#x003D;4), while this treatment had no effect on progenitors (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4 G</xref>). However, in this scenario, the multipolar mode was not as directed as seen in the Stathmin overexpression condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H&#x2013;J</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 H</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). This could indicate that Arp2/3 activity is also involved in this mode of migration and not only for basal process attachment. Multipolar movement was also described previously for amacrine cells (ACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chow et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we performed high time resolution imaging of translocating ACs to compare their behavior to that of RGCs. ACs also initially showed a bipolar morphology and moved only slowly towards the inner nuclear layer (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4 J</xref>). However, once these cells lost their apical process attachment, their velocities and directionality increased (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4, K&#x2013;M</xref>) similarly to RGCs.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results indicate that RGC migration is a robust process and cells can adopt an alternative mode of movement when translocation depending on the presence of the basal process is impaired. Notably, this second mode of translocation is less efficient. Nevertheless, RGCs reach the basal retinal layer where they can polarize.</p>

<title>Complete arrest of RGC translocation and their ectopic maturation disturbs retinal lamination</title>
<p>The surprising finding that RGC translocation can also occur via a multipolar migratory mode argued that RGC movement is particularly robust. We speculated that the robustness of RGC translocation exists, because a failure of RGC displacement would have severe consequences for retinal development. To test this, we needed a condition in which both displacement modes, the one depending on basal process attachment and MTs as well as the multipolar mode, were impaired. We noted that Rockout treatment led to very little disturbance of the apical actin pool (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3, E</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) and translocating RGCs kept their apical process over the whole time span of imaging up to 9.5 hrs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, we did not favor this condition, as analysis would involve spinning disk microscopy, which would distort experimental kinetics. We preferred a genetic condition instead. It was previously shown that overexpression of a membrane-targeted atypical protein kinase C zeta (aPKC-CAAX), led to restructuring of actin organization in progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strzyz et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether overexpression of this construct could suffice to block RGC basal process attachment but allow cells to keep their apical process. Phalloidin staining of the apical surface of corneal cells in the <italic>Tg(hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX)</italic> line revealed disorganized and less abundant microridges but increased cortical actin presence (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 F</xref>). We then imaged this transgenic line in combination with a <italic>Tg(ath5:gap-GFP)</italic> line. Heat shock was performed between 30 hpf and 32 hpf so that aPKC-CAAX was present when RGC emergence was at its peak. Live imaging revealed that in this condition RGCs indeed lost their basal process after apical division and for more than 6 hours did not lose their apical process (while the apical process was lost after 200 min (median) in the stathmin condition). This resulted in RGCs projecting axons while being localized in apical and central regions of the retina. These cells never moved to the basal retinal layer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The analogous phenotype was observed when aPKC-CAAX expression was restricted to the <italic>ath5</italic> lineage using <italic>ath5:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX</italic>. Also in this case cells after terminal division did not reach the basal retinal layer and extended an axon at central retinal positions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Results from live imaging were corroborated by Zn5 staining, which showed that in the heat shock condition a significant portion of RGCs remained in mid-retinal regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">C</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 B</xref>).</p>

Control <italic>SoFa2</italic> retinas showed normal lamination (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 A</xref>), whereas in combination with the <italic>Tg(hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX)</italic> line heat shocked at 32 hpf, RGCs were misplaced and this displacement was not corrected over development (arrows in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Notably, in this case the formation of other neuronal layers was also perturbed, with neurons aberrantly positioned and, in some cases, arranging around ectopically placed RGCs. This misplaced layering persisted until 96 hpf, and bipolar cells could sometimes be seen wrapped around ectopic RGC patches (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Lamination defects also occurred after mosaic injection of <italic>ath5:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX</italic> DNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

<p>We needed to ensure that the observed phenotypes in the <italic>Tg(hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX)</italic> line did not originate from defects in later translocation or neurogenesis events but were caused specifically by RGCs, which failed to translocate. To this end, we compared embryos heat shocked at different developmental stages. We overexpressed aPKC-CAAX at the peak of RGC generation, after the peak and when the RGC layer was fully formed, i.e. at 30 hpf, 36 hpf and 48 hpf respectively. Imaging at 96 hpf confirmed the severe lamination defect in the fish heat shocked at 30 hpf (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 C</xref>). In contrast, fish heat shocked at 36 hpf showed only few ectopic cell clusters (arrowheads in <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 D</xref>) and fish heat shocked at 48 hpf (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 E</xref>) were indistinguishable from controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Additionally, we used a published <italic>ath5</italic> morpholino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pittman et al., 2008</xref>) to knock down this transcription factor as its absence is known to suppress the generation of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kay et al., 2001</xref>). This enabled us to test whether lamination defects also occurred when no RGCs were present. <italic>Tg(hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX, vsx1:GFP)</italic> embryos injected with <italic>ath5</italic> morpholino, which were heat shocked at 30 hpf showed RGC layer partially filled with bipolar cells but did not develop an optic nerve (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kay et al., 2001</xref>). The otherwise normal lamination (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>) of their retina at 96 hpf strongly argued that defects seen in the <italic>Tg(hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX)</italic> fish were indeed caused by the presence of ectopically differentiating RGCs. Thus, successful RGC translocation to basal positions is crucial for later retinal lamination events.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigate the first step of neuronal lamination in the zebrafish retina, the formation of the RGC layer. We reveal the kinetics of the RGC somal translocation mode and show that it represents a directed movement dependent on basal process attachment. When RGC somal translocation is impaired, cells can resort to a multipolar migratory mode. When both modes are inhibited though, RGCs fail to translocate and the resulting misplaced RGCs induce lamination defects, indicating that RGC translocation represents a crucial first step for the formation of other retinal layers. We summarize our main findings in (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Summary of different RGC translocation scenarios</title>
<p>A) Somal translocation of RGC inheriting the basal process, a mode used by 80&#x0025; cells. The RGC translocates basally faster than the sister cell. Directionally persistent somal translocation is followed by fine positioning, during which cells lose their apical process and eventually form the axon.</p>
<p>B) Somal translocation of RGC not inheriting the basal process, a mode used by 20&#x0025; of cells. The RGC initially lags behind the sister cell during the basal movement. Later it regrows the basal process and overtakes it. Translocation is less efficient than in A). Fine positioning phase, during which cells lose their apical process and eventually form the axon is shorter than in A).</p>
<p>C) Multipolar migratory mode. This mode occurs after microtubule destabilization or Arp2/3 inhibition and in rare cases in control cells. After loss of basal process attachment, the RGC also detaches its apical process and increases protrusive activity. The cell then moves towards the basal side using the multipolar mode. This movement is less efficient than in A). Axon formation and RGC layer establishment are not affected by the multipolar movement.</p>
<p>D) No translocation. In case RGC translocation is inhibited, cells are able to differentiate at ectopic locations instead of establishing a compact RGC layer, which has severe consequences for later retinal lamination.</p></caption>

<title>Similarities and differences between emerging RGCs and retinal progenitors</title>
<p>RGCs are the first neurons emerging in the vertebrate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cajal, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nawrocki, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sidman, 1961</xref>) and at the time of their birth the majority of retinal cells are still apically dividing neuroepithelial progenitors. At first sight, apical progenitors and emerging RGCs appear similar: they both display bipolar morphology and the nucleus represents the bulkiest part of the cell. In addition, we found that both cell types translocate their nuclei towards basal positions more efficiently when they inherit the basal process. For both cell types, the basal translocation is fastest and most directional right after cell division, when the apical side of the retina represents a boundary preventing the movement back in apical direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). However, basal nuclear displacement is faster in RGCs, arguing that additional mechanisms are involved in these cells. Notably, the two cell types also differ in the organization of their MT cytoskeleton: in progenitor cells MTs are more dynamic, whereas RGCs feature stabilized MTs, which are involved in efficient basal translocation of their soma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Cellular requirements for RGC somal translocation</title>
<p>We show that the most efficient mode of RGC basal movement is directed somal translocation. Unlike many other neuronal migration events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cooper, 2013</xref>), this movement is continuous instead of saltatory. Most RGCs inherit the basal process after their last apical division and this helps their efficient translocation. We show that when basal process attachment is impaired, RGC translocation is less efficient and cells often form their axons in mid-retinal positions. In addition to basal process attachment to the basal lamina, we show that MTs in the apical process are important for efficient basal translocation of RGCs. These stabilized MTs might prevent the nucleus from sliding back towards apical positions and allow the movement to be more persistent compared to progenitors, in which the nucleus often stalls or reverses apically. This notion is underlined by the finding that in the Stathmin overexpression condition, in which MTs are depolymerized, nuclei have less directional trajectories including jumps towards more apical positions.</p>
<p>It is possible that lateral interactions between RGCs and their neighboring progenitors, for example via contacts to their basal processes, play an inductive role in efficient somal translocation. Such observations have been made in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Famulski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Elias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marin et al., 2010</xref>) and it will be interesting to address whether and how neighboring cells influence RGC movements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>RGCs can switch to a multipolar mode to reach basal positions when somal translocation is perturbed</title>
<p>Surprisingly, we noted that even when basal process attachment or stabilized MTs are disturbed, RGCs often still reached the basal RGC layer. In these scenarios, cells are stalled at the apical side of the retina before they retract their apical process and switch to a multipolar migratory mode. Once this multipolar migration is initiated, it is only slightly less efficient than the directional phase of somal translocation. The reason for the preservation of RGC directional persistence could lie in the fact that, when RGCs emerge, the majority of the retina is still occupied by stably attached bipolar progenitors. These tightly packed, elongated progenitors might prevent tangential movement of RGCs. It is also possible that additional guidance cues are involved in establishing directionality of multipolar migration and it will be interesting to explore these possibilities. Notably, RGCs are not the only neuronal cell type capable of employing two different translocation modes. It has been shown that projection neurons of the mouse cerebral cortex like RGCs can employ several different migratory modes including somal translocation and multipolar migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). We further showed that amacrine cells exhibit a similar pattern of slower bipolar phase of translocation with apical process and faster final multipolar movement after apical process loss. However, our result that amacrine cell translocation does not seem to be affected in the aPCK-CAAX ath5 morphant condition argues that the cascades driving apical detachment differ between these two cell types. This might not be surprising considering the fact that for amacrine cell translocation multipolar migration is the canonical mode of movement while for RGCs it is the exception. How apical detachment and the switch to multipolar migration differ between these two cell types will be an interesting point to solve in future studies.</p>
<p>This suggests that there are common patterns in neuronal migration in different organisms and that findings made in the zebrafish retina can be extrapolated to other areas of CNS development.</p>

<title>RGC layer formation orchestrates subsequent retinal lamination events</title>
<p>The finding that RGCs can switch their mode of movement upon different perturbations reveals that RGC basal displacement is an unexpectedly robust process. We speculate that this robustness emerged to ensure later retinal lamination, because when RGC translocation is compromised, all following lamination events seem to be affected. Interestingly, we find that RGCs can organize later born cells around themselves when they are found at ectopic positions. It is described that RGCs play an organizing role during inner plexiform layer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kay et al., 2004</xref>), but it is also known that the zebrafish retina can laminate relatively normally when RGCs are absent due to genetic depletion of the key transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kay et al., 2001</xref>). This is also seen in the combined aPKC-CAAX overexpression <italic>ath5</italic> morphant condition in which retinal layering seems normal, most likely because no ectopic RGCs are present. Overall, this suggests that even though RGCs are not required for retinal lamination per se, when they are present, they play an organizing role regardless of their position.</p>
<p>We also observe that ectopic RGCs polarize normally and can form axons at any position in the retina, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Randlett et al., 2011b</xref>). The time that has passed since the terminal mitosis, rather than progression of RGC translocation, seems to regulate when axonogenesis commences in a cell-autonomous manner and slower translocation of RGCs that did not inherit the basal process does not delay their axon outgrowth. Additionally, axonogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> is distinct from neuronal behavior <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>), where a multipolar neuron grows several neurites, from which one is later selected to become the axon. In the retina, however, RGCs grow only one directed axon. This is not only true for cells that move via somal translocation, but also for cells that undergo multipolar migration, which is likely due to the polarizing cues present in the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Randlett et al., 2011b</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that RGCs are important to organize all later retinal development independently of their position. These cells may also have a potential to self assemble retinal structures in other tissue contexts, which might be an interesting entry road for therapeutic and transplantation approaches.</p>
<p>Beyond the findings on RGC translocation and retinal lamination events, this study exemplifies the importance of performing well controlled, <italic>in toto</italic> imaging to understand the kinetics and mechanisms of CNS development. Using the gentlest microscopy available allowed us to generate a comprehensive high quality dataset and study the process in question as close to the developmental &#x2018;ground truth&#x2019; as currently possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stelzer, 2015</xref>). If we had limited our study to comparing the &#x2018;before&#x2019; and &#x2018;after&#x2019; situation, many important insights would have been missed, including the multipolar migration mode of RGCs and the importance of basal process inheritance. Obviously, such experiments are not feasible in every tissue or model system. Still, we would like to argue that studies like ours will generate important advances in the understanding of CNS formation and reveal general principles that can be extended to other, less accessible systems.</p>

<p>The translocation of cells was tracked manually in 2D in maximum projected substacks of the raw data by following the center of the cell body in Fiji using ImageJ plugin MtrackJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Meijering et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting trajectories were analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Norden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leung et al., 2011</xref>) by calculating instantaneous velocities, MSDs and directionality ratios. MSDs and directionality ratios were calculated in the DiPer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gorelik and Gautreau, 2014</xref>) executed as a macro in Microsoft Excel. MSD values were fitted with 2D<sub>&#x0394;</sub>t<sup>&#x03B1;</sup> to estimate the &#x03B1; where D is the diffusion coefficient and <sub>&#x0394;</sub>t is the interval between time points. The fit was done with non-linear regression (least squares) in GraphPad Prism.</p>

<title>Script for detection of apoptotic cells in the zebrafish</title>
<p>Author: Benoit Lombardot (Scientific Computing Facility, MPI-CBG)</p>
<p>Contact: <email>lombardo@mpi-cbg.de</email></p>
<p>Date: 2016-07-19</p>
<sec id="s7a">
<title>Description</title>
<p>This script is able to count and characterize fluorescent object in a user-defined region of interest. In particular it was developed to count apoptotic cell cluster (as well as their size) in head region of zebrafish.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7b">
<title>Usage</title>
<p>This section describes how to use the script (i.e. how to perform the analysis and what kind of image it can analyze).</p>
<p>To use the script, download start Fiji, then go to the menu <italic><bold>Help&#x003E;Update&#x2026;</bold></italic>. In the ImageJ Updater window that just open click <italic><bold>manage update site</bold></italic>. A new window opens where one can check the <italic><bold>3D ImageJ Suite</bold></italic> update site. Finally close the windows and restart Fiji.</p>
<p>Once Fiji is started, open the script editor (menu File&#x003E;New&#x003E;Script) and copy the content of the code section in the editor window. In the menu <italic><bold>language</bold></italic> select <italic><bold>python</bold></italic> this should color the syntax of the script. Optionally you can save the disk to your hard-drive (menu <italic><bold>File&#x003E;Save</bold></italic>). The script is now ready to be run.</p>
<p>Open an image and draw a region of interest around the region to analyze. The image can be a 2d image or a z stack with multiple channels. For 3d images the regions of interest needs only to be defined in 2D on one slice of the stack. One of the channels should show objects to detect in fluorescence modality. The objects should be sparse in 3d images as the image will be projected to simplify the analysis and a high density of objects would cause some overlap and degrade the quality of the analysis. Once this is done you can run the script</p>
<p>Once the script starts, a window will open requesting some parameters (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>):
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- <bold>channel to analyse</bold>: the number of the fluorescence channel</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>maximum object radius (in pixel)</bold>: details larger will be filtered out of the image</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>minimum object area (in pixel)</bold>: object smaller than that size will be discarded</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>use automatic threshold</bold>: if checked an Otsu threshold will be used to determine the foreground object</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>manual threshold</bold>: This the threshold value used in case the previous parameter is not checked</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- <bold>use watershed</bold>: if checked stuck objects will be separated with the watershed algorithm</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<caption><title>Window requesting parameters when the script is started</title>
<p>Once parameters are set, one can click ok and proceed with the analysis of the image.</p>
<p>The plugin outputs a result image and some measures. The image shows the user-selected region of interest in green and detected objects contour in red (see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The measure window indicates the number of objects their sum area (in image unit), their sum intensity and the area of the region analyzed (in image unit).</p></caption>

<p>The problem is first reduced to 2 dimensions to simplify the analysis. This is done by doing a maximum projection of the fluorescent channel along the z direction of the stack. The rolling ball algorithm is then applied to the resulting image to remove the background signal. The latter could be due for instance to tissue auto-fluorescence. The rolling ball radius is chosen larger than the radius of the object to be detected which can be estimated manually (for instance with Fiji) in the image. The result is then filtered with a Gaussian kernel of standard deviation 1 pixel to remove noise and regularize the image. The image is then thresholded with the Otsu method or manually if user requested it. In the case the user chose a manual threshold, it can be estimated from a few images by looking at the typical intensity of objects to detect and choosing a threshold worth 5 percent of that value. Then same manual threshold can then be used to analyze all the images of an experiment. After the thresholding one obtains a mask image showing the detected objects. If object are stuck together using the watershed option can help to separate the object to improve count quality. The objects outside the user-defined region of interest are then set to zero. The number of object in the final mask is then determined as the number of connected components in the image. Additionally the sum area and intensity of the objects are calculated as well as the region of interest that was analyzed.</p>

<caption><p>A) Comparison of instantaneous velocities during RGC directional phase between spinning disk confocal microscope and LSFM and between directional phase and fine positioning phase in LSFM. The values are taken from the first 95 min (or less) after mitosis or from the first 95 min of the fine positioning. The instantaneous velocities are calculated from the one-dimensional movement along the apico-basal axis of the retina. The movement from apical to basal has a positive sign; the reverse movement has a negative sign. Directional Sp. Disk (n&#x003D;21 N&#x003D;4, 399 data points), Directional LSFM (n&#x003D;140 N&#x003D;24, 2587 data points), Fine pos.

<caption><p>A) Laminin &#x03B1;1 distribution in control retina at 48 hpf. Laminin channel was denoised in Fiji (ROF denoise). Note the three distinct layers of Laminin (magenta) in the developing eye and the RGCs (green) forming a basal layer of the retina. Arrows: Laminin in retinal basal membrane Arrowheads: Laminin in lens and basal membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium. Scale bar: 20 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>B) Laminin &#x03B1;1 distribution after Laminin knockdown. Note that Laminin is still present in the lens and basal membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium but mostly absent in the retinal basal membrane causing a tissue-wide lamination problem with RGC layer forming in the central retina. Arrows: Laminin in retina basal membrane. Arrowheads: Laminin in lens and basal membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium. Note that axons of RGCs associate with a small patch of Laminin left in the retinal basal membrane.</p>
<p>C) RGC translocation is perturbed after Laminin &#x03B1;1 knockdown. Note that after division the cells lose the basal process and do not translocate basally. Dashed lines delimit the apical side of the retina. White dot: RGC followed. Arrowheads: apical process. Time is shown in hh:mm. Scale bar: 10 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>D) Effect of Arp 2/3 inhibition on actin cytoskeleton in the retina. Note the decreased actin staining in the 200 &#x03BC;M condition in the basal and central retina. The apical actin belt associated with adherens junctions is less affected. The RGC layer labeled by <italic>ath5:gap-RFP</italic> is disorganized. Scale bar: 20 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>E) Effect of ROCK inhibition on actin cytoskeleton in the retina. Note the decreased actin staining in the 75 &#x03BC;M and 125 &#x03BC;M condition in the basal and central retina. The apical actin belt associated with adherens junctions is less affected. The RGC layer labeled by <italic>ath5:gap-RFP</italic> is disorganized. Scale bar: 20 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>F) Staining of apical actin by phalloidin in corneal cells at 48 hpf. Actin is present as two structures: it is associated with adherens junctions around the cell membranes and in microridges all over the apical membrane. The embryos were incubated with the inhibitors from 34 hpf (or heat shocked at 32 hpf) and analysed at 48 hpf. Scale bar: 20 &#x03BC;m. Rockout: Note that even at high Rockout concentration the microridges persist. The cell shape on the other hand is more irregular compared to the control. CK-666: Note the complete absence of microridges and reduced apical area of cells. NWASP-CA overexpression: This construct was injected mosaically and the affected cell is marked with arrowheads and is shown in the inset. Note the massively reduced apical area and altered structure of microridges. aPKC-CAAX overexpression: Note the altered shape of microridges and high accumulation of actin associated with adherens junctions compared to the control.</p></caption>

<p>G) Arp2/3 inhibition by <italic>NWASP-CA</italic> has no effect on retinal progenitor cell cycle or nuclear migration. WT fish were injected with the <italic>hsp70:mKate2-NWASP-CA</italic> and <italic>ath5:GFP-CAAX</italic> (not expressed in these cells) DNA. Time is shown in hh:mm. Scale bar: 10 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>H) Five representative trajectories of the free migrating RGCs in the NWASP-CA overexpression (OE) condition. 0 indicates the mitotic position of cells. The arrowhead marks the time point when the cell loses its apical process.</p>
<p>I) Comparison of instantaneous velocities in NWASP-CA overexpression before and during the multipolar migration and with control conditions. The instantaneous velocities are calculated from the trajectories of cells 95 min after mitosis and 95 after apical process loss. After AP loss NWASP OE (n&#x003D;18 N&#x003D;4, 342 data points), After mitosis NWASP OE (n&#x003D;18 N&#x003D;4, 342 data points).

<p>J) Amacrine cell (AC) translocation. <italic>bactin:ras-GFP, ptf1a:dsRed</italic> double transgenic embryos were used as donors for blastomere transplantation into WT acceptors. The translocating AC (white dot) initially has the AP (white arrowheads). Once it is lost (asterisk), this triggers fast directional movement to its final position. Gray phase: still with apical process. Green phase: directional multipolar mode. The dashed line delimits the apical side of the retina and the inner nuclear layer (INL), where the amacrine cells reside. Time is shown in hh:mm. Scale bar: 10 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>K) Comparison of instantaneous velocities in amacrine cells (ACs) before and after apical process loss. 4 outliers were discarded by ROUT (Q&#x003D;1.0&#x0025;). ACs after AP loss (n&#x003D;24 N&#x003D;3, 257 data points), ACs before AP loss (n&#x003D;24 N&#x003D;3, 462 data points). The differences between instantaneous velocities are statistically significant: ACs after AP loss vs. ACs before AP loss Mann-Whitney U test p&#x003C;0.0001. The median ACs after AP loss&#x003D;0.18 &#x03BC;m/min, ACs before AP loss&#x003D;0.05 &#x03BC;m/min.</p>
<p>L) A representative trajectory of the translocating AC from (J). The arrowhead marks the time point when the cell loses the apical process.</p>
<p>M) Directionality ratio of ACs before and after apical process loss. The average of all tracks is shown with error bars representing S.E.M. The interval of 50 min before and 50 min after AP loss was taken into account, because that is the average duration of the directional movement after apical process loss in ACs. Directionality ratio at the end of the trajectory: ACs after AP loss &#x003D;0.92 ACs before AP loss &#x003D;0.60.</p></caption>

<caption><p>A) Control retina development. The <italic>SoFa2</italic> transgenic fish (combination of <italic>ath5:gap-RFP</italic> (labeling RGCs and photoreceptors), <italic>crx:gap-CFP</italic> (labeling photoreceptors and bipolar cells), <italic>ptf1a:Gal4-VP16 UAS:gap-YFP</italic> (labeling horizontal cells and amacrine cells) were heat shocked at 32 hpf and imaged in the LSFM from 36 hpf every 12 hours. The fish were kept in the incubator between the time points. No ectopic RGCs developed. Scale bar: 20 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>B) Fluorescence signal of the <italic>hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX</italic> construct from <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>. Fish were heat shocked at 30 hpf, fixed at 48 hpf and stained with Zn5 antibody. The fluorescence of mKate2-aPKC-CAAX is only detectable within 24 hours of heat shock due to the fast turnover of the protein. The dashed lines mark the apical and basal membranes of the retina. Scale bar: 20 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>C) D) E) aPKC-CAAX perturbs retinal lamination only during a short time window. <italic>ath5:gap-RFP, vsx1:GFP, hsp70:mKate2-aPKC-CAAX</italic> triple transgenic line was heat shocked at 30 hpf (C), 36 hpf (D) or 48 hpf (E), fixed at 96 hpf and stained with DRAQ5 to additionally label the nuclei. The severe lamination problems can be observed in (C). Mild phenotype can be seen in (D) with only a few ectopic clusters of bipolar cells (arrowheads) and in (E) the retina is indistinguishable from the control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>) with only one continuous RGC layer and the whole retina forming an unperturbed layered structure. Scale bar: 50 &#x03BC;m.</p></caption>
