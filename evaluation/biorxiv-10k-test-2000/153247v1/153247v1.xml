<abstract>
<p>The rules by which neurons in neocortex choose their synaptic partners are not fully understood. In sensory cortex, intermingled neurons encode different attributes of sensory inputs and relay them to different long-range targets. While neurons with similar responses to sensory stimuli make connections preferentially, the relationship between synaptic connectivity within an area and long-range projection target remains unclear. We examined the local connectivity and visual responses of primary visual cortex neurons projecting to anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM) higher visual areas in mice. We found that layer 2/3 neurons preferentially connected to those projecting to the same long-range target and avoided connecting to cells projecting to different targets. Although AL and PM projection neurons differed in their visual responses, these differences were not sufficient to explain the lack of connectivity between them. Thus, projection target, alongside response similarity, is a key determinant of local synaptic connectivity in cortical microcircuits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Uncovering the relationship between the connectivity and function of cortical neurons is fundamental to understanding the circuit mechanisms of information processing. While a neuron&#x2019;s receptive field, determined by the pattern of inputs it receives, defines a set of stimulus features that drive it to fire, its local and long-range axonal projections define its impact on other neurons. Recent work has begun to uncover the rules by which the receptive fields of excitatory neurons constrain their local connectivity. In layer 2/3, pyramidal neurons preferentially connect to neurons that receive common synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morgenstern et al., 2016</xref>) or respond to similar visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell el al. 2015</xref>). However, little is known about how neurons&#x2019; long-range projection targets relate to their local connectivity and functional properties.</p>
<p>Paired recordings of layer 5 pyramidal neurons indicate that connectivity between different projection classes is highly asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brown and Hestrin 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kiritani et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Morishima et al. 2011</xref>). The large pyramidal tract type neurons in layer 5, such as corticospinal cells in motor cortex, and cortico-collicular cells in visual cortex, receive more input than they provide to intratelencephalic (IT) projection neurons (e.g. corticostriatal or corticocortical cells), suggesting they integrate local input before broadcasting information to subcerebral motor-related structures. Whether similar rules govern the local connections of projection neurons targeting different cortical areas is not known.</p>
<p>Signals from primary sensory areas of the neocortex are distributed to downstream areas that work in parallel to deconstruct the sensory scene. Cortical projection neurons innervating different areas may already specialize in encoding different attributes of sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Movshon and Newsome 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Jarosiewicz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Glickfeld et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yamashita et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kim et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lur et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting they comprise separate output channels sub-serving different sensory and behavioural functions.</p>
<p>In the mouse visual system, signals are relayed from primary visual cortex to a number of higher visual cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wang and Burkhalter 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>), which differ in their functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Marshel et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andermann et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Roth et al., 2012</xref>). Among these, the anterolateral visual area (AL) specializes in processing fast moving low spatial frequency stimuli, while the posteromedial visual area (PM) responds primarily to high spatial frequencies. The axonal boutons of V1 neurons in these areas share these biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Glickfeld et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Matsui and Ohki, 2013</xref>). To understand how the long-range targets of V1 neurons that comprise these projections relate to their local connectivity, we measured the connection rates between neurons projecting to areas AL and PM using multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. These recordings reveal that layer 2/3 neurons tend to make connections with cells projecting to the same long-range target, while connections between cells projecting to different areas are rare. These observations show that the long-range projection target of cortico-cortical neurons constrains their potential local synaptic partners.</p>
<p>We have previously observed that local connectivity of pyramidal neurons in mouse V1 is correlated with their selectivity for visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). To examine how the specific connectivity of AL and PM projection neurons relates to their visual response properties, we recorded the activity of these cell populations simultaneously in awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Although they differed in their speed tuning and direction selectivity, both populations were highly heterogeneous in their visual responses. The activity patterns of cell pairs projecting to the same area tended to be more similar than of those projecting to different ones. However, these differences were not sufficient to explain the exclusive connectivity of these populations, suggesting that other mechanisms play a role in sculpting local connections of projection neurons.</p>

<title>AL and PM projecting neurons are largely non-overlapping populations</title>
<p>To what extent do V1 projections to areas AL and PM originate from distinct populations of neurons? To answer this question, we injected the tracer Choleratoxin B or retrograde Pseudorabies Virus (PRV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Oyibo et al., 2014</xref>) into these areas, identified using intrinsic signal imaging, and examined the distribution of retrogradely labelled neurons in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-d</xref>). Cells labelled with both tracers and therefore projecting to both higher visual areas were rare and were found primarily in deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Therefore, AL and PM projecting neurons in V1 comprise intermingled, non-overlapping populations.</p>

<title>AL and PM projection neurons form exclusive subnetworks in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex</title>
<p>Excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 form synaptic connections with only a small fraction of nearby neurons that shares their similar visual selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al. 2015</xref>). To understand if the projection target of layer 2/3 neurons in V1 further restricts their local connectivity, we measured the connection rates between different populations of corticocortical projection neurons in layer 2/3. After functionally mapping V1 and surrounding cortical areas using intrinsic signal imaging (see Methods), we injected fluorescent the retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin B (CTB)-conjugated with AlexaFluor-488 and -594 into areas AL and PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; see Methods for the details). After allowing at least 3 days for the retrograde transport of the tracers, we assessed the connectivity of retrogradely-labelled AL and PM projection neurons in layer 2/3 of V1. We identified retrogradely-labelled neurons in acute slices and targeted up to six neurons for simultaneous whole-cell patch-clamp recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f-g</xref>) to access their synaptic connectivity, strength, and intrinsic membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hofer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The overall connectivity rate of retrogradely-labelled neurons was 13.1 &#x0025; (51/388), consistent with previous reports for randomly sampled pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>). However, AL projection neurons were less likely to provide input to PM projection neurons than to other AL projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Similarly, connections from PM to AL projection neurons were less common than between PM projecting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). There was no significant difference in distances between the somata of AL/AL and AL/PM pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, median 69.5 &#x03BC;m and 64.0 &#x03BC;m, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.66). Although AL/PM pairs tended to be further apart than PM/PM pairs (median 64 &#x03BC;m and 48 &#x03BC;m, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.024), this difference could not account for lack of connectivity between them. Indeed, we observed that none of the 44 AL/PM pairs closer than 48 &#x03BC;m were connected.</p>
<p>The amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials between connected PM projection neurons was similar to that of AL projection neuron pairs (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.10, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Due to the rarity of connections between AL and PM projection neurons, no conclusion could be made about their connection strength. Finally, we found no statistical difference in intrinsic membrane properties of AL and PM projection neurons in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) or short-term plasticity (paired pulse ratios) of postsynaptic responses of AL and PM neurons. (30 Hz, 5 ms pulse stimulation; AL to AL, 0.92 &#x00B1; 0.39 (mean &#x00B1; standard deviation), <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 26; PM to PM, 0.92 &#x00B1; 0.61, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 11; AL to PM, 1.05 &#x00B1; 0.22, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 3; PM to AL, 0.94 &#x00B1; 0.19, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 4). These values are comparable to findings reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Maravall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Oswald and Reyes, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, AL and PM projection neurons in V1 have similar biophysical properties but differ in their pat-terns of local connectivity. They form exclusive subnet-works, preferentially making synaptic connections with neurons projecting to the same target.</p>

<title>AL and PM projection neurons carry distinct visual information</title>
<p>How do the mutually exclusive subnetworks of AL and PM projection neurons differ in their responses to visual stimuli? To answer this question, we simultaneously imaged the activity of these cell populations in awake mice passively viewing grating stimuli. After identifying areas AL and PM using intrinsic signal imaging, we used Pseudorabies Virus (PRV)-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Oyibo et al., 2014</xref>) and CTB-conjugated with AlexaFluor-647 to back-label V1 neurons projecting to these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a-b</xref>). Meanwhile, we expressed GCaMP6f broadly in V1 neurons. We then imaged brain volumes spanning 320-420 &#x03BC;m across and 80 &#x03BC;m in depth 100-300 &#x03BC;m below cortical surface, while tracking animals&#x2019; running behaviour and eye movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>To characterize the selectivity of AL and PM projection neurons for different attributes of visual input, we varied the spatial and temporal frequency of the grating stimuli over 6 octaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Neurons in both sub-populations were highly heterogeneous and spanned the full range of spatial and temporal frequency preference as well as orientation and direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, they were quantitatively different in several respects. First, PM projection neurons tended to prefer high spatial frequency stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c-e</xref>), while AL projection neurons preferred high temporal frequency and high speed stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c-d,f-g</xref>). These observations are consistent with the visual response properties of axonal boutons of V1 neurons in areas AL and PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, reminiscent of MT projection neurons in macaque area V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Movshon and Newsome, 1996</xref>), cells targeting area AL tended to be more direction selective than PM projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).</p>

<p>Behavioral state modulates the responses of neurons in mouse V1 (Neill and Stryker, 2010). To determine whether AL and PM projection neurons are differentially modulated by behavioral parameters, we examined the relationship of their responses with running speed and pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Since running speed and pupil diameter are themselves correlated with each other, to disambiguate their effects we calculated the partial correlation of single cell responses with each of these two parameters whilst controlling for the other. Although the responses of both AL and PM projection neurons correlated with pupil diameter, this modulation was stronger for AL projecting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). PM and AL projection neurons showed no significant difference in their modulation by running speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k</xref>).</p>

<title>Response correlations of AL and PM projection neurons do not explain their exclusive connectivity</title>
<p>In layer 2/3 of mouse V1, pyramidal neurons that show correlated responses to visual stimuli are more likely to connect to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>). Could the similarity of responses of cell pairs projecting to the same long-range target explain the exclusive local connectivity of AL and PM projection neurons? Simultaneous recordings of AL and PM projection neurons allowed us to directly test this hypothesis. We first compared the overall similarity of activity patterns by calculating Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient of fluorescence traces between pairs of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Across the population, correlations decayed with separation between cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lur et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ringach et al., 2016</xref>). Correlations of cell pairs projecting to PM showed the same pattern as unlabelled neurons. On the other hand, cells pairs projecting to AL showed higher correlations at distances exceeding &#x007E;100 &#x03BC;m than either unlabelled or PM projection neurons, perhaps reflecting their global modulation by behavioural state. However, pairs of cells projecting different long-range targets were less correlated than either unlabelled cell pairs or pairs projecting to the same target. These results parallel the relative absence of local connections between AL and PM projection neurons observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether this observation could be explained by differences in tuning between AL and PM projection neurons, we compared their signal correlations, computed as the correlation coefficient of mean responses across stimulus types, and noise correlations, defined as the correlation of trial-to-trial deviation in responses from the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c-d</xref>; see Methods). Although cells projecting to the same long-range target had higher signal correlations than cells targeting different areas, this difference was more pronounced for noise correlations, suggesting that it is the trial-to-trial variability in responses of projection neurons and not their visual selectivity that gives rise to the reduced correlations of cell pairs projecting to different targets.</p>
<p>We then used the previously reported relationship between synaptic connectivity and response correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>) to estimate the expected connectivity rates of these subpopulations, assuming they were determined solely by the similarity of their responses. We estimated the connection probability for individual cell pairs using the relationship in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> as a lookup table, and then averaged these values across each population. Although the mean correlations were lower for cell pairs projecting to different targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), the correlation distributions over-lapped extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Consequently, predicted connectivity rates were similar for different cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Importantly, observed connectivity for cell pairs projecting to different long-range targets was significantly lower than predicted by their response correlations. This observation suggests differences in visual response selectivity alone cannot explain the lack of connections between AL and PM projection neurons and that other mechanisms must play a role in establishing the exclusive connectivity of projection neurons in mouse V1.</p>

<title>Specific connectivity of AL and PM projection neurons</title>
<p>By examining the local connectivity of V1 neurons projecting to areas AL and PM, we observed that connections between neurons projecting to different targets were rare. Asymmetric connectivity has previously been described for different classes of layer 5 projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brown and Hestrin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Morishima et al., 2011</xref>), but has not been examined for corticocortical neurons projecting to different cortical areas.</p>
<p>Recent work has identified similarity of visual responses as the prime predictor of local synaptic connectivity between pyramidal cells in mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al., 2015</xref>). However, the extensive overlap of functional properties of AL and PM projection neurons predicts a much higher rate of connectivity between these populations than we observed in this study, and other explanations must be considered. One possibility is that AL and PM projection neurons are hard-wired to avoid making connections with neurons projecting to the other target by their molecular makeup. This would imply that the molecular identity of pyramidal neurons regulates the selection of their local as well as long-range connections.</p>
<p>To what extent could this exclusive connectivity rule generalize to other populations of projection neurons in layer 2/3? Further work is required to determine the extent to which the projections from V1 to other higher visual areas constitute distinct non-overlapping populations, and how these targets constrain their local connectivity. Nonetheless, estimates for the overall rate of connectivity, ranging from 10 to 20&#x0025;, set an upper bound on the possible number of exclusively interconnected local subnetworks. Assuming a within population connectivity rate of 20&#x0025;, as observed in our study, it is unlikely that more than two major exclusively connected subnetworks of projection neurons exist. Therefore, if similar connectivity rules apply to other populations of projection neurons, it seems likely that they would participate in same subnetworks as AL or PM projection neurons rather than forming their own subnetworks.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Functional specialization of projections to higher visual areas</title>
<p>By analogy with dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing in primates, it has been proposed that projections from mouse V1 to areas AL and PM are specialized for extracting different types of information from the visual scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Glickfeld el al., 2013</xref>). Although neurons projecting to areas AL and PM are biased to different preferred speeds, and temporal and spatial frequencies, both projections are highly heterogeneous. It therefore seems more probable that both of these projections relay a complete representation of the visual scene, tailored to the computational needs of different target areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Correlated responses of AL and PM projection neurons</title>
<p>Responses of V1 pyramidal neurons projecting to the same long-range target tend to be weakly positively correlated, while cell pairs projecting to different targets have lower correlations than randomly sampled neurons. These correlations arise primarily from shared trial-totrial variability in neuronal responses rather than differences in stimulus selectivity between different projecting populations. These observations parallel the connectivity of these cell populations and suggest that the decreased correlations between AL and PM projection neurons are a consequence of the dearth of synaptic connections between them. In essence, the lack of connections between these subpopulations appears to functionally insulate them, preventing the fluctuations in activity one population from influencing the other.</p>
<p>What is the impact of these correlations on sensory coding by V1 projection neuron populations? It seems reasonable to assume that higher noise correlations among neurons projecting to a particular area would limit the potential information bandwidth of that pathway. However, as recent work has demonstrated that the effects of noise correlations on information coding cannot be readily inferred from pairwise measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>), this question warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>What is the computational benefit of the exclusive connectivity of AL and PM projection neurons, given their extensive functional overlap? The absence of recurrent connections between AL and PM projection neurons could allow top-down signals to modulate the activity of these projection pathways independently. Reduced noise correlations between these cell population may be a signature of this modulation. Characterizing how the activity of different populations of projection neurons in V1 is shaped by behavioural demands will help identify the circumstances that lead to their selective recruitment. This view extends the function of recurrent connection in layer 2/3 beyond acting purely to amplify feed-forward responses, and suggests that they also play a role in defining the output of different projection neuron populations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Animals and surgical procedures</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional animal welfare guidelines and licensed by the Swiss cantonal veterinary office. We used wild-type C57BL/6 mice for in vitro recordings, and Ai14 LSLtdTomato mice for in vivo imaging experiments.</p>
<p>Animals were anaesthetized with 5 mg/kg midazolam, medetomidine 0.5 mg/kg, and 0.05 mg/kg fentanyl and a metal headplate was implanted exposing the skull over the right visual cortex. The skull was covered with transparent cement to prevent infection. After recovery from the implant surgery, mice were prepared for intrinsic imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Roth et al., 2016</xref>). Square full contrast gratings of random orientation (0.08 cycles per degree) moving at 4 Hz were presented to the left eye within a circular aperture 25&#x00B0; in diameter at 0&#x00B0; elevation and 60&#x00B0; or 90&#x00B0; azimuth on a gray screen for 2 seconds at a time with an 18 second inter-stimulus interval. Response maps to the apertures at either position were used to identify the location of areas AL and PM.</p>
<p>At least a day after the intrinsic imaging session, animals were anaesthetized with midazolam/medetomidine/fentanyl anaesthesia and retrograde tracers (Cholera Toxin B conjugated to AlexaFluor-488 and AlexaFluor-594 for in vitro experiments, Cholera Toxin B conjugated to AlexaFluor-647 and PRV-Cre for in vivo experiments) were injected into retinotopically matched locations in areas AL and PM localized using the intrinsic response maps.</p>
<p>For in vivo calcium imaging, AAV hSyn-GCaMP6f was injected into area V1. 7-10 days after the injections, a craniotomy 4 mm in diameter was made exposing the visual cortex under midazolam/medetomidine/fentanyl anaesthesia. A glass coverslip (4 mm diameter, 0.17 mm thickness) was implanted for chronic calcium imaging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>To quantify the distribution of AL and PM projection neurons V1, mice injected with retrograde tracers were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde. The brains were extracted and post-fixed overnight before being prepared for sectioning and imaging using the TissueCyte serial two-photon tomography system (Tissue-Vision). For quantification of the distribution of AL and PM neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we used one mouse injected with Cholera Toxin B AlexaFluor-647 in AL and PRV-Cre in PM and one mouse injected with Cholera Toxin B AlexaFluor-594 in AL and Cholera Toxin B AlexaFluor-488 in PM.</p>

<title>In vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recording</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices were performed in mice of both sexes, aged between postnatal 27-35. After mice were lightly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with a cold choline chloride based solution containing (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO3, 25 D-glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgCl2, 3.1 sodium pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 0.5 CaCl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bureau et al., 2006</xref>) with &#x007E; 325 mOsm. Visual cortex slices (300-350 &#x03BC;m thickness) were cut coronally on a vibrating blade microtome (VT1200S, Leica Biosystems) with the same choline chloride based solution bubbled with 95&#x0025; O2/5&#x0025; CO2. Then, the brain slices were incubated at &#x007E; 34&#x00B0;C, for 20-40 min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing 125 mM NaCl., 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM D-glucose; 315-320 mOsm adjusted by adding the amount of D-glucose, bubbled with 95&#x0025; O2/5&#x0025; CO2, pH 7.4. Afterwards, the brain slices were continuously maintained at room temperature before being transferred to the recording chamber.</p>
<p>In vitro patch-clamp recordings were performed with Scientifica multiphoton imaging microscope and a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Vision-S, Coherent) at 780 nm with a Nikon 16x water-immersion objective (NA 0.8). Scanning and image acquisition were controlled by SciScan (Scientifica) and custom software written in Lab-VIEW (National Instruments). Recording pipettes were mounted on remote-controlled motorized micromanipulators (MicroStar, Scientifica). Recording pipettes were made using thick-walled filamentous borosilicate glass capillaries (G150F-4, Warner Instruments) using a horizontal puller (P-1000, Sutter Instrument) adjusted to produce pipette resistance of 7-8 MOhm with a long taper when filled with intracellular solution in 34&#x00B0;C ACSF. The potassium based internal solution containing 5 mM KCl, 115 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-GTP, 10 mM Na-phosphocreatine, 0.1&#x0025; w/v Biocytin; osmolarity 290-295 mOsm, pH 7.2 was used. Liquid junction potentials were not corrected.</p>
<p>Projection neurons were targeted under visual guidance using a custom laser-scanning Dodt contrast imaging system, and simultaneous two-photon imaging for detection of AlexaFluor-488 and -594 fluorescence in labelled neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were carried out from up to 6 cells simultaneously at &#x007E; 34&#x00B0;C, using Multiclamp 700B amplifiers (Axon Instruments) and custom-written MATLAB software (MathWorks). To test for the presence of synaptic connections, five presynaptic spikes by current injections at 30 Hz were evoked in each cell sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), repeated 20 to 150 times, while searching for corresponding postsynaptic responses. Recordings with series resistances be-low 35 MOhm were included for analysis.</p>
<p>Connection probabilities were calculated as the number of connections detected over the number of potential connections assayed. Monosynaptic connections were identified when the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell 7.8-12.8 ms following presynaptic stimulation (5 spikes, 30 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) was significantly greater than during the 5 ms preceding it (Wilcoxon signed rank test <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.01; excluding the time period of electrical stimulus artefacts, e.g. connections between neurons AL2 and PM2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and the latency of the peak postsynaptic response was consistent across 5 presynaptic pulses.</p>
<p>Paired pulse ratios were calculated as the amplitude of the 2nd postsynaptic response divided by the amplitude of the 1st postsynaptic response. For intrinsic membrane properties of AL and PM projection neurons, step currents from -50 pA to 900 pA at 50 pA increments for 1 s were injected to determine I-V relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1a-b</xref>). Detailed definitions and protocols are shown in the figure legends.</p>

<title>In vivo two-photon calcium imaging</title>
<p>Awake mice were head-fixed and allowed to run on a styrofoam wheel. A rotary encoder monitored rotation of the wheel, while a camera recorded eye movements and pupil dynamics. Signals from the rotary encoder and eye camera were acquired using custom LabVIEW software (National Instruments). A monitor (47 cm wide) was placed 22 cm away from the eye spanning a field of view of 122&#x00B0;. Monitor position was adjusted such that the centre of the screen matched the preferred retinotopic location of the imaging site, as judged by two-photon fluorescence responses to grating patches flashed at different locations on the screen.</p>
<p>Fluorescence signals were recorded using a ThorLabs B-Scope 2 resonant scanning two-photon microscope with a Nikon 16x water-immersion objective (NA 0.8) operated using ScanImage 5.1 software. Volumes of 8 frames spanning 80 &#x03BC;m in depth and 320-420 &#x03BC;m in X/Y were acquired at 3.75 Hz using a piezo focuser (PI P-726). For identification of retrogradely imaged neurons, reference volumes of AlexaFluor-647 fluorescence were imaged at 830 nm with a 676/29 nm emission filter (Semrock), while tdTomato fluorescence was imaged at 930 nm with a 607/70 nm emission filter (Semrock). GCaMP6f fluorescence was visible at both wavelengths and was used to align the reference volumes. For functional imaging, GCaMP6f fluorescence was imaged using 930 nm excitation at 10-30 mW with a 520/40 nm emission filter (Chroma).</p>
<p>To prevent the light from the monitor from interfering with imaging, the monitor backlight was controlled by a custom electronic circuit and only switched on during the turn-around of the resonant X mirror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). Gratings of 6 spatial frequencies, 6 temporal frequencies and 8 directions were interleaved randomly and presented without gaps for 6-8 repetitions. Each grating first remained stationary for 2.1 seconds (8 volumes), before moving for 2.1 seconds (8 volumes).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Pupil diameter was estimated as the major axis of an ellipse fit to thresholded images from the eye tracking camera.</p>
<p>Two-photon imaging frames were registered using a phase-correlation algorithm, ROIs were selected and fluorescence time series were extracted. Projection neurons labelled with AlexaFluor-647 and tdTomato were identified manually. To correct for neuropil contamination from global fluctuations in neural activity, we used the residuals of robust linear regression of each fluorescence trace against the mean population fluorescence.</p>
<p>To characterize the direction, spatial and temporal frequency tuning of individual cells, we fit their responses as the product of a double Gaussian in direction space and a 2D Gaussian in spatial and temporal frequency space with arbitrary orientation. If <italic>SF<sub>pre f</sub></italic> and <italic>TF<sub>pre f</sub></italic> are the preferred spatial and temporal frequency of the cells, and <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> is the orientation of the SF/TF tuning Gaussian, let &#x0394;<italic>x</italic> and &#x0394;<italic>y</italic> be defined as:

<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="153247_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>We determined the values of the fit parameters that minimized the square error of the predicted response using <italic>lsqnonlin</italic> in MATLAB. For the analysis of tuning properties of AL and PM projection neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we selected robustly responsive and orientation tuned neurons (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of the fit <italic>&#x003E;</italic> 0.1, width of direction tuning <italic>&#x03C3;<sub>Dir</sub> &#x003C;</italic> 40 degrees). However, we reached the same conclusions if we included all AL and PM projection neurons.</p>
<p>Total correlations were computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient of single frame fluorescence responses during the entire stimulus series. Signal correlations were computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient of the mean responses to the moving grating of each type. To calculate noise correlations, we subtracted these means from individual trial responses to the moving phase of the grating stimuli.</p>
<p>To estimate the relationship between total correlation and connection probability, we applied our neuropil correlation procedure to data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cossell et al.

We estimated the relationship between total correlation and connection probability using LOWESS regression. We used bootstrap resampling to derive confidence intervals for this relationship. We then estimated the predicted connection probability each population of projection neurons as the average of connection probabilities for individual pairs of neurons based on their total correlations.</p>
