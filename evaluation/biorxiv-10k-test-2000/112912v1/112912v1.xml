<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular health in mid-to-late life suggest causal relationships, but the nature of these has not been explored systematically at younger ages. Using complementary MR and recall-by-genotype (RbG) methodologies, our objective was to estimate the causal effect of BMI on detailed measures of cardiovascular health in a population of young healthy adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods and Findings</title>
<p>Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used. For MR analyses, a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 97 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and constructed using external weighting was used as an instrument to test the causal effect of each unit increase in BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) on selected cardiovascular phenotypes measured at age 17 (N=7909). An independent enriched sample from the same cohort participated in a RbG study at age 21, which enabled more detailed cardiovascular phenotyping (N=418; 191/227 from the lower/upper &#x223C;30&#x0025; of a genome-wide GRS distribution predicting variation in BMI). The causal effect of BMI on the additional cardiovascular phenotypes was assessed by comparing the two recalled groups. Difference in mean BMI between RbG groups was 3.85kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95&#x0025; CI: 2.53, 4.63; <italic>P</italic>=6.09&#x00D7;10<sup>11</sup>). In both MR and RbG analyses, results indicated that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (indexed to height<sup>2.7</sup>, LVMI) in young adults (e.g. difference in LVMI per kg/m<sup>2</sup> using MR: 1.07g/m<sup>2.7</sup>; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.62, 1.52; P=3.87&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;06</sup> and per 3.58kg/m<sup>2</sup> using RbG: 1.65g/m<sup>2.7</sup> 95&#x0025; CI: 0.83, 2.47; P=0.0001). Additionally, RbG results indicated a causal role of higher BMI on higher stroke volume (SV; difference per 3.58kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 1.49ml/m<sup>2.04</sup>; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.62, 2.35; <italic>P</italic>=0.001) and cardiac output (CO; difference per 3.58kg/m<sup>2</sup>: 0.11l /min/m<sup>1.83</sup>; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.03, 0.19; <italic>P</italic>=0.01). Neither analysis supported a causal role of higher BMI on heart rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Complementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of appropriate sensitivity analyses, showed that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher BP and LVMI, even in youth. These consistent results support efforts to prevent or reverse obesity in the young.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Higher body mass index (BMI) in adulthood is likely to be causally associated with numerous cardiovascular risk factors and disease outcomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Whilst chronic conditions may have origins early on, these relationships have been assessed predominantly from the 5<sup>th</sup> decade of life[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. It is assumed that these relationships reflect long-term exposure to adiposity and other co-morbidities, which result in adverse structural and functional cardiovascular changes that are different from adaptations encountered earlier in the disease&#x2019;s evolution.</p>
<p>Numerous observational studies have reported associations between higher BMI and the presence of various subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) even during young adulthood[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. However, these observational study designs preclude a distinction between correlation and causation due to issues such as confounding or possible reverse causation (particularly in studies of older adults, whereby the &#x2018;outcome&#x2019; is responsible for the variation in the &#x2018;exposure&#x2019;). Whilst recent results from patients who have had bariatric surgery provide supportive evidence for a causal role of greater adiposity on risk of major cardiovascular events[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], no large studies have assessed the causal impact between BMI and cardiovascular phenotypes in early life where risk emerges.</p>
<p>One method for establishing evidence for causal relationships between an exposure and outcome of interest is Mendelian Randomization (MR), a technique which uses genetic variations as instrumental variables (IVs) in observational epidemiological studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Due to the technique&#x2019;s requirement for relatively large sample sizes to provide adequate statistical power, however, MR studies traditionally use either routinely collected clinical measures or data generated from high-throughput technologies. Detailed and precise subclinical measures of early structural and functional vascular adaptations are not commonly carried out in large population studies, as these are expensive, time-consuming and require highly skilled operators. This has limited their suitability for analyses using MR methodology.</p>
<p>Recall-by-genotype (RbG) studies are an innovative extension of MR designed to improve study efficiency through the creation of subgroups selected based on genotypes possessing known correlations with exposures of interest (e.g. BMI), rather than random sampling based on extremes of BMI itself.The added statistical power of this technique enables the efficient collection of extremely precise phenotypic data that may be otherwise impractical at the scale necessary for MR analyses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we aimed to employ these two complementary analytical approaches (MR and RbG), alongside conventional multivariable regression analyses, to support the hypothesis that BMI causally influences variations in multiple clinically relevant measures of cardiovascular structure and function in adolescence and early adulthood, when risk emerges.</p>

<title>Cohort description</title>
<p>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective birth cohort study investigating factors that influence normal childhood development and growth. The cohort and study design have been described in detail previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and are available at the ALSPAC website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk">http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk</ext-link>). The study website contains details of all data that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionaryI">http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary</ext-link>). Briefly, 14541 pregnant women resident in a defined area of the South West of England, with an expected delivery date of 1<sup>st</sup> of April 1991 - 31<sup>st</sup> of December 1992 were enrolled to the cohort. Of these, 13988 live-born children who were still alive 1 year later have been followed-up to date with regular questionnaires and clinical measures, providing behavioural, lifestyle and biological data. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from both the parent/guardian and, after the age of 16, children provided written assent.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>The two complementary analytical approaches (MR and RbG) were used to support the hypothesis that BMI causally influences variations in multiple clinically relevant measures of cardiovascular structure and function in adolescence and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Firstly, we used a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 97 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) constructed using external weighting as an IV within an MR framework to investigate the causal effect of BMI on a range of vascular measures collected from 17-year-old participants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>In parallel with this approach, we examined the ability of a highly-powered RbG design to reproduce these findings and explore their underlying mechanisms further through the extensive phenotyping of a smaller group of independent individuals, recalled specifically on a genome-wide GRS distribution[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Of those with full genetic data and consent (N=8,350), individuals were invited to the RbG study based on the lower and upper &#x223C;30&#x0025; of a genome-wide GRS distribution, constructed from results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BMI conducted by Speliotes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Individuals were recalled based on their appearance in the sampling groups, from the most extreme to the least to maximise power and difference in BMI. Of those invited (N=4602), 419 individuals were successfully recalled across the distribution of invited sampling groups (Supplementary Methods).</p>
<p>We excluded data of all females who were pregnant or individuals who had diabetes at both the 17-year clinic (N=7 pregnancies and 15 diabetics) and the 21-year recall (N=1 pregnancy and 0 diabetics). After exclusions, 7,909 individuals at age 17 were included in MR-analyses, which used a GRS comprising 97 SNPs (constructed using external weighting) shown to be associated with BMI from a large-scale GWAS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The independent sample of 418 individuals were used in the 21-year RbG analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

The independent sample of 418 individuals was used in the RbG study, based on the lower and upper &#x223C;30&#x0025; of a continuous genome-wide GRS distribution for BMI, constructed on the basis of results from a GWAS of BMI[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. A total of 191 were within the lower tail and 227 were in the upper tail.

<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>Participants were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Participants were excluded due to having at least one of: incorrectly recorded sex, minimal or excessive heterozygosity, disproportionate levels of individual missingness, evidence of cryptic relatedness or non-European ancestry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of &#x003C;1&#x0025; and call rate of &#x003C; 95&#x0025; were removed and only SNPs that passed an exact test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>) were included. Imputation of genotypes was conducted with MACH 1.0.16 Markov Chain Haplotyping software, using CEPH individuals from phase 2 of the HapMap project as a reference (release &#x0023;22).</p>

<title>Measures of adiposity at age 17 and 21</title>
<p>At both ages, height was measured to the nearest centimetre using a stadiometer (SECA 213, Birmingham, UK) and weight to the nearest 0.1 kilogram, unshod and in light clothing, using electronic weighing scales (Marsden M-110, Rotherham, UK). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height-squared (m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Cardiovascular phenotypes at age 17</title>
<p>The following cardiovascular phenotypes were used in MR analyses to assess the causal role of BMI on cardiovascular health at age 17.</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Blood pressure and heart rate</title>
<p>Sitting BP and heart rate were measured in both arms with an Omron 705 IT oscillometric BP monitor in accordance with European Society of Hypertension guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The average of the final two of three readings was used and the arm with the greatest number of valid observations was used for analyses. From the systolic and diastolic BP readings (SBP and DBP, respectively), mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated (DBP &#x002B; (SBP-DBP)/3). Pulse pressure (PP) was calculated as the difference between SBP and DBP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e2">
<title>Pulse-wave velocity (PWV)</title>
<p>Aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral PWV) was assessed using a Vicorder device (Skidmore Medical, UK). Participants rested supine on a couch with their head raised to 30&#x00B0;. Real-time pulse-wave measures were recorded between proximal (right carotid) and distal (the upper right thigh) sensor cuffs and with the time delay between the two simultaneously measured cardiac cycles measured. Transit distance was measured from suprasternal notch directly to the top of the thigh cuff. Measurements were taken until pressure waveforms over the carotid and thigh area were of high quality and reproducible. Three carotid-femoral PWV measurements, within &#x2264;0.5 m/s of each other, were averaged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e3">
<title>Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)</title>
<p>Common carotid artery B-mode ultrasound images were acquired in the ear&#x2013;to-ear plain with the head rotated to 45&#x00B0; from the midpoint using a Zonare Z.OneUltra system equipped with a L 10-5 linear transducer (Zonare Medical Systems, CA, US). Images were recorded in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format as 10 second cine-loop files for offline analysis using the Carotid Analyzer (Medical Imaging Applications, Coralville, IA). Left and right cIMT were taken to be the average of three end-diastolic measurements located on the far-wall of a single segment of arterial wall 5&#x2212;10 mm in length and 10 mm proximal to the bifurcation. The mean of left and right cIMT was calculated and used in analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e4">
<title>Left ventricular mass (LVM)</title>
<p>A sub-sample of study participants from the 17-year clinic underwent echocardiography using a HDI 5000 ultrasound machine (Phillips) and P4-2 Phased Array ultrasound transducer using a standard examination protocol. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was estimated according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Cardiovascular phenotypes at age 21</title>
<p>The following detailed cardiovascular phenotypes were also measured in the two RbG groups at age 21.</p>
<sec id="s2f1">
<title>Blood pressure and heart rate</title>
<p>BP and heart rate were measured in the right arm in the supine position using a digital automated sphygmomanometer (Omron M6, Omron Healthcare, Netherlands) and the mean of two values used for analyses. MAP and PP were calculated in the same way as at 17 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f2">
<title>Pulse-wave velocity</title>
<p>Arterial stiffness was assessed using applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor Vx, AtCor Medical, NSW, Australia), with PWV estimated using ECG-gated pulse waves travelling between carotid-femoral sites. The patient was rested in a supine position and a handheld tonometer was placed over the left carotid artery in order to allow the recording of 10-12 clear and reproducible pressure waveforms. The same tonometer was then used to measure a similar number of femoral arterial pulse waveforms in the inguinal crease at the top of the right leg. Transit distance was measured between the upper edge of the suprasternal notch and the femoral pulse measurement site via the umbilicus using a tape measure. The device software calculated the mean transit time (in milliseconds) from the recorded pulse waveforms and PWV was calculated as the transit distance/transit time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f3">
<title>Carotid intima-media thickness</title>
<p>Ultrasound assessment of the thickness of intima media interface was measured using an identical protocol to that described for age 17.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f4">
<title>Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
<p>All measures were made using a 1.5T MR scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Endocardial borders of the left ventricle (LV) were traced manually on short axis stacks at end-diastole and end-systole to evaluate end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV). Stroke volume (SV) was obtained by subtracting ESV from EDV. Epicardial borders were traced in end-diastole to calculate an epicardial volume. The EDV was subtracted from this volume, multiplied by assumed myocardial density to obtain LVM.</p>
<p>Flow quantification was performed through-plane in a cross-section of the ascending aorta as it passes the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries using an ECG-gated spiral phase-contrast MR sequence, as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. This technique allows images to be acquired within a short breath-hold (0.5 seconds) with a spatial resolution of 1.6 &#x00D7; 1.6 mm and a temporal resolution of 30 milliseconds. All images were processed using in-house plug-ins for the Open source software OsiriX (OsiriX Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland). Flow images were manually segmented (using the modulus images) and SV (ml) was measured and cardiac output (CO, L/min) was calculated as SV x heart rate. At the time of flow imaging, BP was simultaneously measured using MRI-compatible oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Datex Ohmeda). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR; measured in mmHg.L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was calculated by dividing the measured mean BP by CO. Total arterial compliance (TAC) was calculated by optimisation of the two-element Windkessel model, as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Briefly, the flow curves and SVR were used as inputs to the model. PP was calculated for a series of modelled pressure curves generated using a range of TAC values from 0.1 to 5.0 mL.mmHg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in increments of 0.01. The compliance value that gave the smallest error between the modelled PP and the true PP was taken to be the true compliance.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Confounders</title>
<p>Due to potentially confounding effects, the following variables were added as covariates in the multivariable regression analyses: maternal education and household occupation, plus current smoking status and the most recent records of physical activity and, where available, dietary intake.</p>
<p>At enrolment, mothers reported their educational attainment and both her and her partner&#x2019;s occupation. Highest household occupation was used to assign participants a household social class, using the 1991 British Office of Population Census Statistics classification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Both maternal education and household social class were used as a general indication of socioeconomic position.</p>
<p>The most recent measurement of dietary intake of the participant was total energy intake at age 13, previously estimated from linear spline multi-level models of the combination of food frequency questionnaires and diet diaries[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Additionally, the most recent record of physical activity was defined as the counts per minute (CPM) and minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) obtained from a subsample of participants at the 15-year clinic by an MTI Actigraph AM7164 2.2 accelerometer worn for 7 days[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Smoking status was obtained by questionnaire and participants were coded as &#x201C;ever&#x201D; or &#x201C;never&#x201D; smokers.</p>
<p>For analyses using data from the 21-year RbG group, physical activity and smoking status were obtained via questionnaire at the time of cardiovascular phenotyping; however, information on recent dietary intake was not available. Participants at this age were similarly classed as &#x201C;ever&#x201D; or &#x201C;never&#x201D; smokers and weekly exercise was categorised as either &#x201C;never/rarely/&#x003C;2 times a week&#x201D; or &#x201C;&#x2265;2 times a week&#x201D;.</p>

<title>Pre-analysis transformations and adjustments</title>
<p>As the distribution of residuals from the linear regression of BMI on carotid-femoral PWV was positively skewed, values of these variables were log transformed. LVM measured at each age was indexed to height to the power of 2.7 (LVMI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. To assess the impact of adiposity on central vascular measures over and above that caused by stature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], SVR and TAC were adjusted for height using SVR &#x00D7; height<sup>1.83</sup>, TAC/height<sup>1.83</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], and both CO and SV measures were indexed to height by dividing CO by height<sup>1.83</sup> and SV by height<sup>2.04</sup>. The use of &#x201C;positive&#x201D; and &#x201C;inverse&#x201D; throughout the text refer to directional association rather than clinical implication. Stata 14 (Stata Corp, Texas) and R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) were used for all analyses.</p>

<title>Multivariable regression</title>
<p>Observational associations between BMI and each cardiovascular phenotype at age 17 were assessed using multivariable linear regression in three models: (i) unadjusted, (ii) adjusted for age, sex, smoking status and dietary intake of the participant, household social class and maternal education and (iii) additionally adjusted for physical activity (added as a separate model due to sample size). Associations of the confounders with BMI, cardiovascular measures and weighted GRSs at each age were tested using linear regression.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Mendelian randomization</title>
<p>The externally weighted GRS used as an instrument for BMI in MR analyses was generated from 97 independent SNPs shown to be reliably associated with BMI in the GWAS conducted by the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. To generate the GRS, the dosage of each BMI-increasing allele at each locus in ALSPAC was weighted by the external effect size of the variant in the GWAS results[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The doses were then added together and multiplied by the average external effect size of all the SNPs on BMI to reflect the number of average BMI-increasing alleles carried by each individual.</p>
<p>Two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis was performed using the GRS as an instrument for BMI at age 17 (<italic>ivreg2</italic> command in Stata). <italic>F</italic>-statistics for the first-stage regression between the GRS and BMI were examined to check that the instruments were valid, satisfying the assumption that the instrument was sufficiently associated with the exposure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) test for endogeneity was used to compare multivariable regression and IV effect estimates (<italic>ivendog</italic> command in Stata)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>

<title>Recall-by-genotype</title>
<p>Linear regression was used to assess the association of the genome-wide GRS group allocation (upper vs. lower &#x223C;30&#x0025; of the genome-wide GRS distribution, as described above) with BMI and each of the cardiovascular phenotypes measured at age Each estimate therefore represents the mean difference in each variable with the corresponding mean difference in BMI between RbG groups.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Sensitivity analyses</title>
<p>Both BP and heart rate are correlated with other cardiovascular measures, namely PWV, cIMT and LVMI[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. To assess the causal association between BMI and these cardiovascular measures, independent of BP and heart rate, we took the residuals of the regression between each of these variables and both BP and heart rate and repeated MR and RbG main analyses using these residuals.</p>
<p>Additionally, evidence suggests that some of the cardiovascular phenotypes used in these analyses are not independent of height[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. To account for this and the inconsistent residual correlation between BMI and height throughout the lifecourse[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], we assessed the association between the weighted GRS on height at age 17 and explored the impact of adjustment for height and height-squared on the association between the weighted GRS and BMI. We also adjusted both multivariable regression and MR analyses for height and height-squared measured at the same time of the BMI exposure and cardiovascular phenotype and compared these to the main analyses.</p>
<p>The use of multiple alleles in MR analyses increases the potential for unbalanced pleiotropic effects due to aggregation of invalid genetic instruments having an effect in one particular direction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. To investigate the validity of the weighted GRS as an IV, the MR-Egger[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] approach was used to detect and accommodate violations of the MR assumptions, where the intercept of the MR-Egger test can be interpreted as an estimate of the average pleiotropic effect across the genetic variants, with a non-zero intercept term indicating overall directional pleiotropy. MR-Egger estimates were compared to those obtained from the inverse-variance weighted (IVW)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] and weighted median methods[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], which provide estimates of the causal effect of BMI on cardiovascular phenotypes under varying assumptions of instrument validity. As in the main analyses, the estimates of the association between each SNP and BMI were obtained from an independent external source, as to not induce weak instrument bias in a two-sample MR setting[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], we performed a sensitivity analysis using a weighted GRS that was limited to the genetic variants that were associated with BMI in the analysis of all people of European descent and excluded those that only reached genome-wide significance in only one sex or stratum (n=77) in the GIANT consortium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Additionally, a previous study in a large sample based in the UK[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] suggested exclusion of three variants owing to pleiotropy (rs11030104, rs13107325 and rs3888190) and three SNPs that are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P&#x003C;1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>; rs17001654, rs2075650 and rs9925964). Therefore, as a sensitivity analysis, we excluded these additional SNPs, resulting in an instrument consisting of 71 independent SNPs.</p>
<p>Additionally, to assess the validity of the genome-wide GRS (derived from the results of the BMI GWAS conducted by Speliotes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and used in main RbG analyses), MR analyses were conducted using the same genome-wide GRS as an instrument for BMI, scaled to represent the same difference in mean BMI per unit increase in the genome-wide GRS compared to the Locke <italic>et al</italic>. score, comprising 97 SNPs, used in main MR analyses.</p>

<title>In silico recall-by-genotype analyses</title>
<p>To support the main RbG analyses at age 21 and the use of a genome-wide GRS, we conducted two <italic>in silico</italic> RbG analyses with available cardiovascular phenotypes at age 17. From the larger sample of individuals originally used in the MR analyses who had no missing data on BMI or cardiovascular outcomes at age 17 (N=1190), we randomly sampled 200 individuals from the lower and upper &#x223C;30&#x0025; of the distribution of i) the Locke <italic>et al</italic>.

<p>Of the cardiovascular measures that overlapped between the two methods (MR and RbG), the RbG groups were associated with higher SBP (difference in mean between higher vs. lower RbG groups: 3.70mmHg; 95&#x0025; CI:1.74, 5.66; <italic>P</italic>=0.0002), DBP (difference: 2.25mmHg; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.98, 3.52; <italic>P</italic>=0.001), MAP (difference: 2.73mmHg; 95&#x0025; CI: 1.47, 3.99; <italic>P</italic>=0.00003) and carotid-femoral PWV (difference: 0.03log(m/s); 95&#x0025; CI: 0.01, 0.06; <italic>P</italic>=0.01) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Scaling the effect estimates to represent a kg/m<sup>2</sup> higher BMI, as in the MR analyses, these results are equivalent to a 1.03mmHg higher SBP, a 0.63mmHg higher DBP, a 0.76mmHg higher MAP and a 0.01log(m/s) higher carotid-femoral PWV. There was therefore considerable consistency between effect estimates on the overlapping phenotypes at both ages, i.e. each kg/m<sup>2</sup> higher BMI had a causal effect of similar magnitude on SBP, DBP and MAP, whilst showing no association with heart rate or cIMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, there was evidence for a positive causal effect of BMI on carotid-femoral PWV in RbG analyses at age 21 that was not evident in MR analyses at 17 years.</p>

<p>In addition to these cardiovascular measures, the RbG framework enabled the collection of more precise cardiovascular phenotypes and showed a positive causal role of higher BMI on MRI-derived LVMI (difference in mean between higher vs. lower RbG groups: 1.65g/m<sup>2.7</sup>; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.83, 2.47; <italic>P</italic>=0.0001), SV (difference: 1.49ml/m<sup>2.04</sup>; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.62, 2.35; <italic>P</italic>=0.001) and CO (difference: 0.11l/min/m<sup>1.83</sup>; 95&#x0025;CI: 0.03, 0.20; <italic>P</italic>=0.01), with no evidence of a difference in SVR or TAC.</p>

<title>Sensitivity analyses</title>
<p>After adjusting for SBP and heart rate, both MR and RbG results for the effect of BMI on cIMT, carotid-femoral PWV and LVMI were mostly consistent with main analysis (Supplementary Table S7). The one exception was the positive effect of BMI on carotid-femoral PWV shown in RbG analysis, which attenuated to the null following adjustment for SBP and heart rate (estimate: 0.02(log(m/s)); 95&#x0025; CI:-0.01, 0.04; <italic>P</italic>=0.18).</p>
<p>The weighted GRS (comprising 97 SNPs), used in MR analyses, was not associated with height or height-squared at age 17. Adjusting for both height and height-squared made no difference to the association between the GRS and BMI at age 17 (Supplementary Table S8a), multivariable regression analyses (Supplementary Table S8b) or MR analyss (Supplementary Table S8c).</p>
<p>Where pleiotropy is perfectly balanced, an informative GRS is sufficient in an MR analysis, but this method is less able to cope with unbalanced pleiotropic effects (where invalid genetic instruments have an aggregate effect in one particular direction)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The MR-Egger can go some way to accommodate violation of MR assumptions through pleiotropy, where the intercept term provides an estimate for unbalanced pleiotropy. This test provided no evidence for unbalanced pleiotropic effects of the genetic variants included within the GRS on any cardiovascular outcome (all <italic>P</italic>-values for the intercept &#x2265; 0.24) (Supplementary Table S9). The MR effect estimates from IVW, MR-Egger and weighted median analyses for the causal effect of BMI on the cardiovascular phenotypes were largely consistent with the main analyses, though the effect estimate of BMI on SBP did not agree for the weighted median analyses compared to the main MR, IVW and MR-Egger estimates, albeit with very wide confidence intervals (Supplementary Table S9 and Supplementary Figures S1a-S1e).</p>
<p>Both the instrument containing 77 SNPs (found in Europeans and analyses of both sexes only in the GIANT GWAS, Supplementary Figure S2) and 71 SNPs (found in Europeans only and removing potentially pleiotropic SNPs and those that were not in HWE in a large sample based in the UK, Supplementary Figure S3) were associated with BMI to a comparable extent as the GRS comprising the full set of 97 SNPs (Supplementary Table S10) and produced similar results to the main analyses (Supplementary Tables S11b and S11b, respectively). Similarly, when the genome-wide GRS initially used to recall individuals to the RbG study was implemented in MR analyses, the GRS was associated with a comparable change in BMI (Supplementary Table S10, Supplementary Figure S4) and produced similar results to main MR analyses (Supplementary Table S12).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s5a">
<title>Summary and comparison of findings</title>
<p>In a large cohort of young adults, we employed two complementary analyses (MR and RbG) to investigate the causal effect of higher BMI on measures of cardiovascular structure and function and compared these to adjusted multivariable regression results. Alongside multivariable regression and MR analyses, the RbG method predominantly allowed the collection of extremely precise cardiovascular phenotypes that would otherwise be impractical at scale.</p>
<p>Regarding the cardiovascular phenotypes that were used across MR, RbG and multivariable regression analyses in the current study, our results are consistent with previous observational studies in children and adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] and across all three methodologies used. Results suggest that higher BMI causes higher BP (SBP, DBP, PP and MAP) and higher LVMI, the latter suggesting adverse cardiac structure, even in young adults. Furthermore, the similarity of findings across these methods, given different sources of bias between the MR and RbG on the one hand[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] and multivariable regression on the other[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], strongly support causality in this instance. If further sustained through adulthood, these cardiovascular effects of higher BMI are likely to increase CVD risk and CVD-specific mortality in later life[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous multivariable regression results from smaller observational studies in children and adolescents have found higher BMI to be associated with faster PWV and thicker cIMT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. In contrast to this, our three methods gave results that did not support a causal effect for cIMT. This suggests that previous studies may have been influenced by residual confounding or bias, for which we have been better able to control here. This conclusion is also supported to some extent by analysis of the same variables at a lower age in an observational context[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. With less consistent results across our analysis approaches, higher BMI was associated with slower PWV at age 17 years (i.e. healthier PWV) in multivariable regression analysis and a faster PWV (i.e. worse PWV) in RbG analysis, with MR analysis showing a null association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, another previous study suggests that the relationship between BMI and PWV may be inverse in youth and becomes positive at older ages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>As might be expected, higher BMI resulted in increased CO in our RbG study and, although contrary to other observational studies at this age[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], this appeared to be solely driven by SV, as neither our MR or RbG analyses suggested a causal effect of BMI on heart rate. It is possible that previously reported associations between BMI and heart rate may be a result of unmeasured confounding. The BMI-mediated change in SV (and consequently CO) seen at age 21 is therefore likely to at least partially account for the cardiac hypertrophy and higher BP that we see in multivariable regression, MR and RbG both ages in the data analysed here.</p></sec>
<sec id="s5b">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>A key strength is the comparison of results from confounder-adjusted multivariable regression, MR and RbG, along with a range of appropriate sensitivity analyses, which together provide strong evidence for a causal effect of higher BMI on BP and cardiac structure (LVMI) in young adulthood. This is one of the first uses of RbG for BP and cardiac structure, where we could compare results directly to multivariable regression and MR within the same general population. The consistency between results found from RbG with 418 participants to those from MR with 7,909 participants suggests this approach is valid and statistically efficient. Furthermore, the RbG method allowed the collection of precise cardiovascular phenotypes that would otherwise not have been possible in sample sizes required for MR. For example, we could explore the impact of BMI on SV and CO, measures that are prohibitively expensive to undertake in several thousands of participants.</p>
<p>In contrast to these strengths, it is of course the case that both the MR and RbG analyses may be biased if the IV analyses assumptions are violated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. These require, firstly, that the genetic instruments need to be robustly related to the exposure (here BMI). We used variants in both MR and RbG that have been shown to be genome-wide significant and replicated; the first-stage F-statistics, a measure of instrument strength, were high for all the MR analyses. Secondly, it is assumed that confounders of the observational BMI-cardiovascular outcome association are not related to the genetic instrument. There is empirical evidence that this is unlikely to be the case[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] and for observed confounders we demonstrate it in our analyses here. Thirdly, it is assumed that there is no path from the genetic instrument to the outcomes other than through BMI, which may result from horizontal pleiotropy. Using an aggregate allelic score increases the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy and we therefore undertook sensitivity analyses to explore this[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Across a range of sensitivity analysis (including the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches in the MR analyses, limiting the GRS to different subsets of genetic instruments and performing <italic>in silico</italic> RbG analyses using different genetic proxies), provided broadly similar results to main analyses, lending more confidence to the causal estimates and direction of effect with higher BMI and suggesting that these were not largely driven by horizontal pleiotropy.</p>
<p>Although the RbG approach enabled sampling from lower and upper &#x223C;30&#x0025; of a genome-wide GRS, which produced a difference of &#x223C;3.5kg/m<sup>2</sup> in BMI, the genome-wide nature of the score could be considered less refined than the GRS used in MR analyses, comprising 97 SNPs shown to be robustly associated with BMI in a large meta-analyses of GWASs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Despite this, sensitivity analyses performed showed that the genome-wide GRS provided comparable results to MR-analyses and <italic>in silico</italic> RbG analyses.</p>
<p>One complication in some of the sensitivity analyses performed (specifically, adjusting for variables including BP, heart rate and height in multivariable and MR analyses) is the potential for inducing collider bias[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. However, due to the overall consistency in effect estimates generated from the various sensitivity analyses, this is unlikely to be the case in this study. More generally, it is possible that some of the differences in effect size of BMI on cardiovascular outcomes (for example, carotid-femoral PWV) between methodologies may relate to the difference in age at which the methods were applied. In addition, given the small range of some of the cardiovascular outcomes (for example, cIMT) in these young individuals and the potentially small effect size of BMI, power to detect such small effect sizes in this context may be limited.</p>
<p>Further, we adjusted for a range of potentially confounding factors in multivariable regression analyses but even in such a comprehensive longitudinal cohort, it can be difficult to accurately measure (and therefore appropriately account for) all confounders. Indeed, this illustrates the need for better methods (such as MR and RbG employed here) to assess the causal nature of the association between BMI and cardiovascular health.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With this innovative study design, using complementary multivariable regression, MR and RbG analyses, together with a range of appropriate sensitivity analyses, we found results that strongly suggest a causal role of higher BMI resulting in adverse levels of BP and LVMI. These findings support efforts to reduce BMI and prevent the obesity burden from a young age, with the aim of attenuating the development of vascular and cardiac changes, known to be the precursors of long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and preventing the development of additional peripheral vascular damage not yet evident at this early stage of life.</p>
