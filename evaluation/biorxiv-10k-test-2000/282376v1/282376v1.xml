<title>Abstract</title>
<p>How trafficking pathways and organelle abundance adapt in response to metabolic and physiological changes is still mysterious, although a few transcriptional regulators of organellar biogenesis have been identified in recent years. We previously found that the Wnt signaling directly controls lipid droplet formation, linking the cell storage capacity to the established functions of Wnt in development and differentiation. In the present paper, we report that Wnt-induced lipid droplet biogenesis does not depend on the canonical TCF/LEF transcription factors. Instead, we find that TFAP2 family members mediate the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a, leading to the notion that the TFAP2 transcription factor may function as a &#x201C;master&#x201D; regulator of lipid droplet biogenesis.</p>

<title>Main Text</title>
<p>Cellular adaptation to a changing local environment is imperative for survival and proliferation. This is affected through a collection of sensing and signalling pathways that integrate information about the local environment and induce the requisite changes in various cellular programs that control organelle abundance and function, through multiple routes, including the modulation of transcription. In recent years, several transcriptional &#x2018;master regulators&#x2019; of organellar biogenesis have been reported for mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jornayvaz and Shulman, 2010</xref>), autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chauhan et al., 2013</xref>) and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). While the functional details of this control are still under investigation, coordinated transcriptional control of specific organelles is an emerging theme in cell biology.</p>
<p>Lipid droplets are primary storage organelle for neutral lipids in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, the number and nature of these organelles vary greatly, both over time within a cell, and between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thiam and Beller, 2017</xref>). While a major function of lipid droplets is clearly as the storehouse of triglycerides and sterol esters, the diversity and variation of this organelle likely reflect the number of reported alternate functions of lipid droplets such as regulation of inflammation, general metabolism, and host-pathogen interplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barisch and Soldati, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Melo and Weller, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Konige et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the recognized importance of this organelle in health and disease, little is known of the signalling systems or proximal transcriptional regulators that control lipid droplet biogenesis, function and turnover in cells.</p>
<p>Recently, we used genome-wide, high-content siRNA screens to identify genes that affect cellular lipids. This analysis revealed that the Wnt ligand can potently stimulate lipid droplet accumulation in multiple cell types through upstream elements of the Wnt signalling pathway, including the canonical surface receptors and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a component of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, to further characterize the signalling cascade leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets after Wnt addition, we tested the key components from the canonical Wnt signalling pathway for a role in lipid droplet regulation, starting with the core enzyme of the destruction complex, GSK3B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). We found that overexpression of both the wild-type, and the constitutively-active S9A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stambolic and Woodgett, 1994</xref>) mutant of GSK3B were capable of attenuating lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with the function of GSK3B activity as a negative regulator of Wnt signalling. Further, siRNAs to GSK3B were sufficient to induce lipid droplet accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) &#x2014; much like we had shown after gene silencing of APC, another member of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>We next investigated the possible role of the downstream targets of the Wnt pathway at the transcription level. Surprisingly, siRNAs to TCF/LEF transcription factors relevant in canonical Wnt signalling, failed to affect lipid droplet accumulation - and yet there is no doubt that lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a is transcriptionally mediated. Indeed, the expression of SOAT1, DGAT1 and DGAT2, which encode key-enzymes of lipid droplet formation, increased in response to Wnt3a-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, silencing these genes inhibited lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a, most potently in combination with each other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), or with specific inhibitors to DGAT1 or SOAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - Fig.Sup. 1A</xref>). Finally, Wnt3a-induced lipid droplets were decreased after treatment with the general inhibitor of transcription Actinomycin D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). While these data altogether confirmed that the Wnt pathway was mediating the pro-lipid droplet signal, our inability to link lipid droplet induction to TCF/LEF led us to consider the possibility that a branching signalling path, under the control of GSK3B and/or &#x00DF;-catenin but not the canonical Wnt transcription factors TCF/LEF, was inducing the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells. To explore this possibility, we initiated several parallel and complementary systems-level analyses with the aim to identify the transcriptional regulators proximal to lipid droplet biogenesis.</p>
<p>To better understand the nature of the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt, we revaluated the involvement of individual components of the Wnt signalling pathway in the induction of lipid droplet accumulation. First, we tested the ability of each of the 19 human Wnt ligands to induce lipid droplet accumulation in L Cells by transfection and autocrine or paracrine induction of the Wnt pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-G</xref>). Wnt ligands displayed a broad, but not universal capacity to induce lipid droplet accumulation that paralleled both their evolutionary pedigree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), and previously reported abilities to activate canonical Wnt signalling as measured by a TCF/LEF reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Najdi et al., 2012</xref>). This confirmed that the pro-lipid droplet signal was indeed transiting, at least initially, through canonical Wnt signalling components.</p>
<p>To systematically assess the involvement of the remaining components of the Wnt pathway for involvement in the lipid droplet response, we performed a targeted screen for factors influencing lipid droplet accumulation using a library of 73 compounds selected for known interactions with elements of the Wnt pathway (see Methods). We tested the library in both, Wnt3a-stimulated conditions to assess any inhibitory activity of lipid droplet accumulation, and unstimulated conditions to identify compounds with the ability to induce the phenomenon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> &#x2013; Source Data 1). Indeed, treatment with several compounds reported to activate the Wnt pathway induced lipid droplet accumulation, such as BML-284 (activator of &#x00DF;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2005</xref>)), doxorubicin (activator of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dai et al., 2009</xref>)), and forskolin (activation via PKA-Wnt crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-I</xref>). Conversely, known inhibitors of the pathway such as Tricostatin A (epigenetic regulator of DKK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vibhakar et al., 2007</xref>)) hexachlorophene (&#x00DF;-catenin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2006</xref>)), and niclosamide (inducer of LRP6 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lu et al., 2011</xref>)) significantly decreased the appearance of lipid droplets in response to Wnt3a (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-I</xref>).</p>
<p>While these data certainly confirm the role of Wnts in regulating lipid droplets, they did not reveal the pathway linking the Wnt destruction complex to the transcriptional changes we observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>)). Given these results, and the large number of &#x03B2;-catenin-independent targets of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kim et al., 2009</xref>), we initiated several strategies to identify candidate regulators, in particular the proximal transcription factors directly upstream from lipid droplet biogenesis. Our aim was to identify factors linked to Wnt signalling and to characterize the signalling pathway from ligand-stimulation to lipid droplet accumulation.</p>
<p>We first started by taking the subset of genes annotated as &#x2018;transcription factor activity&#x2019; (GO:0000988) from our primary genome-wide siRNA screen data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>) to identify transcription factors that influenced cellular cholesterol levels in the cell (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 1A</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> &#x2013; Source Data 1). While several of these candidates have well established roles in regulating general proliferation (i.e. MACC1, JDP2, SP3, TP53, ZNF217, TAF1), or links to the WNT pathway in keeping with our findings (i.e. GLI3, SIX2, SOX9, FOXK2, BARX1), we were particularly interested in identifying candidates with reported functions in lipid metabolism. The latter subset included ARNT2, STAT3, KDM3A, ATF5, KLF5, KLF6 and members of the TFAP2 (AP-2) transcription factor family (see below).</p>
<p>As a second approach to search for candidate transcriptional regulators of lipid droplets we compared existing transcriptome data of Wnt3a-treated cells with that of other conditions known to induce the accumulation of lipid droplets in tissue culture cells. It is well-established in the formation of lipid droplets is stimulated artificially by the addition of exogenous fatty acids, and the process has been studied at the transcriptional level in multiple studies. We therefore combined our Wnt3a gene array data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>) with three published datasets of mRNA levels after treatment of cells with fatty acids or knockout of lipid droplet regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lockridge et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>). Our rationale was to identify the relevant transcription factors required for the induction of lipid droplet biogenesis by inferring from the expression data what is the common set of transcription factors active in response to Wnt3a and / or to the modulation of lipid droplets by fatty acid treatment or gene knockout. This analysis involved testing for over-representation of genes annotated to be regulated by a specific transcription factor in the set of the most perturbed genes after either treatment. Wnt3a-stimulation influenced a larger number of transcriptional regulators (172) as compared to lipid droplet modulation (91), but the vast majority of this subset (&#x003E;75&#x0025;) were also changed by Wnt3a (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 1B</xref>).With this approach, we found that many candidate transcription factors known to function in both lipid metabolism and adipogenesis were influenced by Wnt3a-treament and fatty acid perturbation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> &#x2013; Source Data 2), including TFAP2A (p-value Wnt3a treatment: 3.5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>; p-value fatty acid perturbation: 4.8 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>).</p>
<p>As a third systems-level approach, we undertook a direct examination of the promotor regions of annotated lipid droplet proteins as was used by Sardiello and colleagues to identify the transcription factor TFEB and the CLEAR element as master regulators of lysosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). We collected and examined the upstream promoter sequences for the 145 proteins annotated as &#x2018;Lipid Droplet&#x2019; (GO:0005811; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> &#x2013; Source Data 3) and tested for over-represented sequence motifs. Among the most enriched motifs in the upstream promotor region of lipid droplet genes were motifs identified as TFAP2A (pValue: 9.0 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) and TFAP2C (pValue: 1.8 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) binding sites (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 2A</xref>). Further analysis revealed that 74 of the &#x2018;Lipid Droplet&#x2019; proteins contained at least one of the TFAP2A or TFAP2C annotated binding sites (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 2B</xref>, Fig. 2 - Source Data 3) which were generally present within the first few hundred base-pairs from the start site (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The TFAP2 (AP-2) family of basic helix-span-helix transcription factors have been long recognized to play key roles during development. Yet, little else is known regarding their function in adult animals where these proteins are expressed, although various TFAP2 homologs have been linked to tumour progression in cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>). The family consists of five proteins in human and mouse, and are thought to form homo- and heterodimers that bind to similar promotor sequences albeit with different affinities. Given our observation that downstream genes known to be regulated by TFAP2 family members change in response to Wnt3a (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 1B</xref>), that the silencing of TFAP2 genes can regulate cholesterol amounts in cells (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 1A</xref>), and that TFAP2 consensus sites are over-enriched in the promoter sequences of genes encoding for lipid droplet proteins (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 2A</xref>), we began to suspect that TFAP2 proteins mediate the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a. This notion was further buttressed by previous studies showing that TFAP2A directly interacts with both &#x00DF;-catenin and APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2015</xref>) making this family of transcription factors our leading candidate for mediating the pro-lipid droplet signalling activity of Wnt3a.</p>
<p>To gain a detailed description of the transcriptional changes in the context of TFAP2, Wnt and lipid droplets, we performed an RNAseq determination of mRNA levels in cells treated with Wnt3a for short times (2h and 6h) with the aim to identify early factors of the transcriptional control relevant for lipid droplet biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scott and Gruenberg, 2018</xref>). As expected, a pathway analysis of the most responsive genes at 2h found over-representation of terms related to mRNA processing, DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), consistent with the expected nature of the early Wnt3a-responsive genes. By 6h post-Wnt3a treatment, transcriptional regulators were still over-represented, but additional terms reflecting downstream effector pathways were present, including those related to glucose metabolism and endosomal trafficking, as well as fatty acid and cholesterol related genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the RNAseq analysis found that SREBF1 (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1) mRNA levels were the most decreased of any transcription factor (0.60 of control) at the later time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Intriguingly, the most upregulated transcription factor at early times was DDIT3 (DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 3, also known as CHOP) &#x2014; and increased DDIT3 could readily be detected at the mRNA and protein level (<xref rid="fig2S3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 3A-B</xref>). This member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding (CEBP) protein family is a potent and direct inhibitor of SREBF1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>) and a known regulator of cellular lipid metabolism. While this interaction may contribute to the decrease in cellular free cholesterol and the downregulation of cholesterol metabolic enzymes after Wnt3a treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>)), overexpression of constitutively-active SREBF1 truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shimano et al., 1997</xref>) had essentially no effect on the formation of lipid droplets, whether Wnt3a was present or not (<xref rid="fig2S4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 4A</xref>). Neither did treatment with the S1P/SREBF1 inhibitor PF- 429242 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hawkins et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2S4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 4B</xref>) in either Wnt3a-stimulated, or na&#x00EF;ve conditions. These observations suggest that while relevant to the observed changes in cellular cholesterol homeostasis generated by Wnt3a, putative DDIT3-induced changes in SREBF1 expression have no significant role in lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a.</p>
<p>Along with DDIT3 and SREBF1, our list of early Wnt3a-responsive transcription factors includes several that have known functions in regulating cellular lipid homeostasis such as CEBPB and CEBPE, KLF5, KLF10, PPARG, MLXIPL, and PER2. Our list also included the TFAP2 family member TFAP2C, which our datamining strategies had already identified as involved in lipid homeostasis, and as a candidate transcription factor controlling lipid droplet biogenesis. In fact, 6h post-Wnt3a TFAP2C (1.72-fold) was among the most upregulated transcription factors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that our datamining efforts identified TFAP2 family members as putative transcription factors regulating lipid droplet proteins and that TFAP2C was among the most upregulated transcription factors in response to Wnt3a (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), we next investigated whether TFAP2 family members played a direct role in regulating lipid droplets. To this end, we tested whether Wnt3a retained the ability to induce lipid droplets after TFAP2 depletion by RNAi. While knock-down of either TFAP2A or TFAP2C had no or only a modest effect, tandem silencing of both homologs produced a marked reduction in the number of lipid droplets present in cells in response to Wnt3a (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). In keeping with this finding, these siRNA treatments diminished the mRNA levels of SOAT1, a key enzyme proximal to the production of lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) that mediate the production of cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chang et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>As an alternative approach, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout to generate HeLa-MZ cells clones lacking TFAP2A (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). While tandem depletion by RNAi was necessary to reduce lipid droplet production after Wnt3a addition in L Cells, two knockout clones of TFAP2A demonstrated a complete lack of change in lipid droplet number after Wnt3a stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>), indicating that TFAP2 family members exhibit complementary functions. Together, these results imply that TFAP2A/TFAP2C are necessary for mediating the pro-lipid droplet signal of the Wnt pathway.</p>
<p>We next sought to determine if the TFAP2 family is sufficient for the induction of lipid droplets. For this, we fused full-length TFAP2A, TFAP2B, and TFAP2C to mCherry and overexpressed these as exogenous chimeras. As transcription factors the TFAP2 family members function in the nucleus, the mCherry-tagged TFAP family members exhibited a somewhat heterogeneous distribution between cytoplasm and nuclei, presumably because of variations in expression levels. Impressively, the number of lipid droplets per cell increased with increased nuclear localization of each TFAP2 family member (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), and, in cells with TFAP2 nuclear localization, the expression of each family member was clearly sufficient to cause lipid droplet biogenesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). Moreover, the expression of TFAP2C was also able to trigger the expression of lipid droplet enzymes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>), further supporting the notion that TFAP2 family members function as transcriptional regulators of lipid droplet biogenesis.</p>
<p>In totality, these findings demonstrate TFAP2A, TFAP2B and TFAP2C are sufficient to induce biogenesis of lipid droplets when expressed in cells, and members of the TFAP2 family are required to mediate the accumulation of lipid droplets seen in response to Wnt-stimulation. This finding is in keeping with a previous report that targeted overexpression of TFAP2C in mouse liver induced steatosis, accumulation of fat, and eventual liver failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holl et al., 2011</xref>), and given the enrichment in TFAP2 binding sites in lipid droplets proteins (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 2</xref>), implicate the TFAP2 family as central regulators of lipid droplet biogenesis.</p>
<p>Given our observation that TFAP2C expression correlates with DDIT3 expression in cells after Wnt3a treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), we investigated the role of DDIT3 in control of lipid droplets. Indeed, while changes in SREBF1 expression induced by DDIT3 do not seem to be involved in lipid droplet accumulation (<xref rid="fig2S4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 4</xref>), this process may be regulated by DDIT3 itself. We started by examining the promotor region of the transcription factors whose mRNA levels were impacted by Wnt3a-treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) for reported DDIT3::CEBPA consensus sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ubeda et al., 1996</xref>). Intriguingly, not only did we find such a site upstream of the TFAP2C gene, but there was a DDIT3::CEBPA consensus site in 7 out of the 10 lipid-related transcription factors identified in our RNAseq (<xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - Fig.Sup. 1A</xref>), a 1.8-fold enrichment over the frequency in the total Wnt3a-influenced transcription factor set. This lends further support for the view of DDIT3 as an important transcriptional regulator of lipid homeostasis in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>To address this notion directly, we next tested whether DDIT3 itself was able to influence both TFAP2 family members, and the number of lipid droplets in cells. Indeed, overexpression of DDIT3-mCherry chimera resulted in an increase in the mRNA levels of lipid droplet enzymes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further, silencing of DDIT3 both diminished SOAT1 mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These observations suggest that DDIT3 plays a regulatory role in lipid droplet biogenesis, presumably in concert with TFAP2.</p>

<p>We next tested the requirement of DDIT3 for the lipid droplet response directly by interfering with DDIT3 expression by both RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9. Silencing of DDIT3 expression diminished accumulation of lipid droplets both in response to Wnt3a stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>; <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - Fig.Sup. 1B</xref>), and after silencing of APC (<xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - Fig.Sup. 1B</xref>), an alternative strategy previously shown to be sufficient to induce lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Further, knock-out clones lacking DDIT3 were completely non-responsive to Wnt3a with regards to lipid droplet number. In the context of the significant increase in DDIT3 message and protein (<xref rid="fig2S3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - Fig.Sup. 3</xref>), these results suggest that induction of DDIT3 transcription in response to Wnt3a is necessary for lipid droplet biogenesis.</p>
<p>Given that the presence of DDIT3 was necessary to convey the pro-lipid droplet signal, we next tested whether over-expression of the transcription factor is sufficient to induce lipid droplet accumulation. As with TFAP2, overexpression of mCherry-tagged fusions of DDIT3 was sufficient to increase lipid droplet numbers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>; <xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - Fig.Sup. 1C</xref>) in transfected cells as compared to the control. In total, these data suggest that in addition to regulation of cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>), DDIT3 may function as a more global regulator of cellular lipid homeostasis in part through regulation of the TFAP2 family of transcription factors.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In conclusion, our data show TFAP2 family members function to modulate expression of lipid droplet proteins and induce the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells. We found TFAP2C is necessary to potentiate the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a, and expression of TFAP2 family members is sufficient to induce lipid droplet accumulation in cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only do these data support the view that the TFAP2 family of transcription factors can function as regulators of lipid droplet biogenesis, they provide insight into the transcriptional network directing changes in lipid homeostasis and the accumulation of lipid droplets in response to Wnt stimulation. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the canonical TCF/LEF transcriptional response, Wnt signalling via APC, GSK3, and &#x00DF;-Catenin induces transcription-mediated lipid changes. These include decreased levels of SREBF1, which is likely to contribute to the observed reduction in total membrane cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>), and increased expression of DDIT3 and TFAP2, which triggers lipid droplet biogenesis with storage of cholesterol esters and triglycerides. These observations also lead to the notion that via TFAP2 transcription factors, Wnt exerts pro-proliferative effects in developmental and in pathological contexts by leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets.</p>
<p>In addition, Wnt3a has been recently identified as an intra-cell synchronizer of circadian rhythms in the gut, controlling cell-cycle progression, and the mRNA of Wnt3a itself exhibits circadian oscillations under the control of the master clock regulators Bmal1 and Per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Matsu-Ura et al., 2016</xref>). Given this function, it is tempting to speculate that Wnts serve a more general role as a mid- or long-range circadian signalling intermediates, linking lipid metabolism to the master transcriptional clocks that coordinate metabolic functions with the day-night cycle. Because of its circadian nature, and capacity to induce lipid droplet accumulation in a broad range of cells types, Wnts could serve as a fundamental signal for cells to store lipids during times when nutrients are expected to be in excess for later use during periods of rest or fasting.</p>
<p>Both lipid droplets enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Solt et al., 2012</xref>), and the volume of lipid droplets themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Uchiyama and Asari, 1984</xref>), vary in a circadian fashion, which is completely consistent with a role as neutral lipid storage sites. TFAP2 binding sites are over-represented in the promotors of circadian-controlled genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bozek et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the Wnt/TFAP2 control of lipid droplets is one mechanism by which the daily storage of lipids in lipid droplets, and cellular lipid homeostasis itself, is coordinated. Further, targeted overexpression of TFAP2C induced the equivalent phenotype of steatosis in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holl et al., 2011</xref>), underscoring the role of TFAP2 proteins in the regulation of neutral lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>The Wnt pathway is also not the first developmental signalling pathway found to exert key regulatory functions in directing energy metabolism. The FOXA family of transcription factors, fundamental for early embryogenesis, play core roles in directing glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Friedman and Kaestner, 2006</xref>), while SOX17 has been shown to have additional, non-developmental functions regulating lipid metabolism in the liver of adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rommelaere et al., 2014</xref>). Given the overlapping requirement for a molecular queue to synchronize energy storage during both embryo development and daily metabolic activity, it is not surprising that some of these systems have evolved to serve dual roles in both biological contexts. These findings support the view that both Wnt signalling, and the TFAP2 family of transcription factors have important (and possibly linked) roles in development and circadian lipid metabolism of the cell.</p>
