<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that have evolved to maintain native function of the diverse ensemble of protein species, ensuring cellular and organismal health. Proteostasis imbalances and collapse are increasingly implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. The pattern and extent of PN disease alterations however have not been assessed in a systematic and quantitative way at a systems level. Zooming in on the chaperome as a central PN component we turned to a curated functional ontology of the human chaperome that we connect in a high-confidence physical protein-protein interactome network. Challenged by the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in the heterogeneous spectrum of human cancers, we assessed gene expression across more than 10,000 human patient biopsies covering 22 solid cancers and found the chaperome consistently highly upregulated. Increased levels of several chaperones such as HSP90 have previously been associated with poor prognosis in cancers. We used a customized Meta-PCA dimension reduction approach to condense the complexity of cancer transcriptomics datasets into an atlas of quantitative topographic maps. We confirm consist upregulation of the HSP90 family and also highlight HSP60s, Prefoldins, HSP100s, and mitochondria-specific chaperones as pan-cancer enriched. Our analysis also reveals a surprisingly consistent downregulation of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). Strikingly, this analysis also highlights similarities between stem cell and cancer proteostasis, and diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We developed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler tool (Pro<sup>2</sup>) enabling analysis and intuitive visual exploration of proteostasis disease alterations using gene expression data. Our study showcases a comprehensive profiling of chaperome network shifts in human cancers and sets the stage for a systematic global analysis of PN alterations across the human diseasome towards novel hypotheses for therapeutic network re-adjustment in proteostasis disorders.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Eukaryotic proteomes comprise a complex repertoire of diverse protein species that are organized in a modular interactome network in order to execute native function in support of proteostasis and a healthy cellular phenotype. Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that have evolved to safeguard the healthy folded proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balch et al. 2008</xref>). Cellular proteostasis capacity is limited within the constraints of each cell&#x2019;s proteostasis boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Powers et al. 2009</xref>). Proteostasis deficiency and collapse are implicated in a broad spectrum of protein conformational diseases with loss of native function or gain of toxic function, ranging from metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hutt et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Increasing awareness of the fundamental role of the PN in cellular health, its relevance in disease and potential as a therapeutic target of proteostasis regulator drugs call for a systems-level assessment of PN deregulation throughout the human diseasome, towards improved understanding of diseases of proteostasis deficiency and rationalized network-informed approaches to therapeutic proteostasis re-adjustment.</p>
<p>The folding functional arm, or the human chaperome, is highly conserved and of central importance in the PN, responsible for maintaining the native folded proteome. Cancer cells are constantly challenged by the need to accommodate large amounts of proteotoxic stress in consequence of increased translational flux and proliferation. This chronic challenge ultimately drives cancer cells into a dependency on quality control and stress response mechanisms, a phenomenon previously described as non-oncogene addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dai et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Solimini et al. 2007</xref>). Several individual chaperones and heat shock proteins such as HSP90 have consistently been found upregulated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>). However, the profile and extent of chaperome differential expression has not been assessed systematically across the human cancer landscape. Zooming in on the chaperome, which acts to maintain the cellular folding environment in support of the natively folded healthy human proteome, we turned to a recently curated comprehensive functional ontology of the human chaperome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Challenged by the genetic heterogeneity, collective prevalence and medical need of the wide spectrum of human cancers as well as the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations during carcinogenic transformation, we showcase an integrated analytical pipeline and toolkit for the quantitative profiling of chaperome changes across the human cancer landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We utilized an expert-curated functionally annotated chaperome ontology comprising the ensemble of 332 human chaperone, co-chaperone and heat shock protein genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to apply our analytical workflow on a recent and comprehensive cancer gene expression dataset with clinical relevance, we turned to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) compendium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weinstein et al. 2013</xref>). We start with a customized genomic analysis pipeline in order to map chaperome functional family gene expression changes across TCGA solid cancers compared to matching normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resulting top-level view on cancer chaperome deregulation reveals a broad chaperome upregulation throughout the majority of cancers. This consistent and high overall chaperome upregulation prompted us to zoom in on functional sub-families. This analysis surfaces clusters of chaperome functional family up- and downregulation signatures that enable further stratification of cancer groups. In summary, our analysis of the 10 major chaperome functional families reveals pronounced tissue differences of cancer chaperome deregulation. The preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperone families such as HSP90s and HSP60s, while ATP-independent chaperones, co-chaperones, and small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are consistently downregulated, is opposed to chaperome alteration patterns observed in brain tissues during aging and in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). These characteristic chaperome-wide differences further justify our approach and need for systematic maps of PN deregulation across the human diseasome.</p>

<p>In order to enable comprehensive, contextual, and quantitative representations of the complexity of chaperome alterations across a large number of patient biopsy disease datasets, we developed a custom data dimensionality reduction and visualisation approach. Combining a principal component analysis (PCA) based two-step dimension reduction algorithm with polar plot visualisations, we provide intuitive quantitative maps of cancer chaperome gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in complex genetically heterogeneous diseases such as cancers requires the consideration of the cellular interactome network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sahni et al. 2013</xref>). We projected differential gene expression changes onto a custom curated high-confidence physical protein-protein interactome network in order to project chaperome functional family gene expression changes onto the interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then integrated these dimensions into interactome - guided, three - dimensional topographic maps that intuitively provide a quantitative view of cancer-specific chaperome deregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We developed Proteostasis Profiler (Pro<sup>2</sup>), an integrated web-based suite of applications that enables intuitive quantitative analyses and comparative visualisation of differential expression of complex PN alterations across large disease dataset compendia such as the TCGA. Visualisation and analysis features include heat map clustering and polar plot display. Integrated meta-networks and interactome-guided 3D topographic maps ease comparative exploration of cancer chaperome deregulation in the context of interactome network wiring. Pro<sup>2</sup> is designed to serve the scientific community as a user-friendly application for systems-level exploration of PN disease alterations, at reduced complexity.</p>
<p>Overall, this study represents a systematically derived systems-level atlas of chaperome deregulation maps in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, with a detailed focus on chaperome functional family alterations. The integrated genomic analysis workflow, built into the Pro<sup>2</sup> suite of visualisation tools, provides a resource and analytical platform for future characterisation and exploration of PN deregulation patterns across the human diseasome, and as a readout interface for network shifts induced by therapeutic regulation.</p>

<title>Systematic Differential Gene Expression Profiling Highlights Functional Clusters of Chaperome Deregulation in Human Cancers</title>
<p>Homeostasis of the cellular proteome, or proteostasis, is fine-tuned by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that have evolved to safeguard the native functional proteome and cellular health. The human chaperome, an ensemble of 332 chaperones and co-chaperones, represents a central functional arm within the PN in charge of maintaining the cellular folding landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). (Table S1A). Motivated by the genetic heterogeneity of cancers, their prevalence and associated medical need as well as the lack of a systems-level understanding of the role of proteostasis genomic alterations during carcinogenesis, we systematically assessed chaperome gene expression changes across the diverse spectrum of human cancers. We focused on an established resource of human cancer patient biopsy RNA-seq datasets provided through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weinstein et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schubert et al. 2016</xref>). We considered 22 human solid cancers with available corresponding healthy counterpart tissue biopsy data. To obtain global views on chaperome commonalities or differences between cancers, we applied Gene Set Analysis (GSA) in order to quantify gene expression changes of the chaperome and its functional families. GSA is an advanced derivative of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) that methodologically differs primarily through its use of the maxmean statistic, the mean of the positive or negative gene scores in each gene set, whichever is larger in absolute value, that has proven superior to the modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic used in GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Efron and Tibshirani 2007</xref>). Secondly, GSA uses a different null distribution for false discovery rate (FDR) estimations, through a restandardiation of genes in addition to sample permutation in GSEA. This step is crucial, as it allows assessing statistical robustness of the expert-curated chaperome functional gene ontology groups. We obtained the GSA derived probability (p values) for each functional gene group to be significantly up- or downregulated in cancer as &#x0394;GSA values in the interval [&#x2212;1, &#x002B;1] according to ((1 - upregulation p value) - (1 - downregulation p value)).</p>
<p>Notably, the human chaperome is predominantly upregulated across the majority of TCGA solid cancers (&#x002B;0,51 &#x0394;GSA group mean change, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These overall chaperome upregulation highlights cellular non-oncogene addiction to chaperone-assisted folding and protein quality control mechanisms in consequence of increased client load, further challenging cellular proteostasis and driving &#x201C;proteostasis addiction&#x201D; in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Drummond and Wilke 2008</xref>). Despite the diverse established knowledge about the role of chaperone upregulation in cancer, the deregulation of the human chaperome has not been assessed at a systems-level throughout the human cancer landscape. To functionally resolve the general chaperome upregulation across cancers, we zoomed in on functional family gene expression alterations. GSA followed by Euclidean clustering of chaperome functional families revealed characteristic cancer differences. We found the key ATP-dependent HSP90 and HSP60 families, of which selected members have previously been shown to be upregulated in cancers, as the most highly upregulated functional families with the highest group mean changes of &#x002B;0.62 and &#x002B;0.52, respectively, followed by Prefoldins (PFDs, &#x002B;0,46), mitochondria-specific chaperones (MITOs, &#x002B;0,45), and the HSP100 AAA&#x002B; ATPases (&#x002B;0,44) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Intriguingly, the HSP70-HSP40 system and the large family of TPR-domain containing co-chaperones display a transition cluster with less consistent and largely cancer-specific expression alterations. HSP40 co-chaperones cluster closest with HSP70s, indicative of the functional relationship they engage in during the HSP70 chaperone cycle. Surprisingly, HSP70s are largely unchanged across cancers (0,04). While HSP40 co-chaperones are overall only weakly downregulated (&#x2212;0.06), also the second group of co-chaperones, the TPR-domain containing proteins, clustered with the HSP70-HSP40 system and were almost unchanged (&#x002B;0,05). Overall, sHSPs (&#x2212;0,70) and ER chaperones (&#x2212;0,36) clustered at the opposite end, showing consistent, strongly reduced expression in cancers. Besides marked differences in the pattern of cancer functional family changes, Euclidean clustering of cancer groups (rows) revealed three major clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). The vast majority of cancers is characterised by the consistent upregulation of HSP100s, MITOs, PFDs, HSP60s, and HSP90s, opposed by a consistent downregulation of sHSPs. This group comprises Cluster I, representing &#x223C;64&#x0025; of cancers, with consistent downregulation of both sHSPs and ER chaperones, while Cluster II comprises &#x223C;27&#x0025; of cancers in which ER chaperones are upregulated. Cluster III represents two cancers with largely differing chaperome deregulation, skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), both of which feature repression of most chaperome functional families.</p>

<p>In summary, systematically assessing gene expression data derived from a total of 10,456 patient samples uncovers broad differences in chaperome-scale deregulation across the variety of human solid cancers. While the vast majority of cancers shows consistent and strong upregulation of chaperome genes, this analysis reveals marked clusters of chaperome functional family expression signatures that further stratify cancers by differential chaperome expression.</p>

<title>Preferential Upregulation of ATP-Dependent Chaperones in Cancers</title>
<p>The major ATP-dependent chaperone functional families are consistently upregulated across a majority of cancers, while co-chaperones and sHSPs are consistently repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In order to quantify this trend, we assessed the 22 differentially regulated cancer chaperomes for functional characteristics.</p>
<p>First, we compared expression of 88 chaperones against 244 co-chaperones represented in the human chaperome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Projecting TCGA cancer groups by their chaperone and co-chaperone differential expression highlights a significant preponderance of cancer chaperome upregulation, including both chaperones and cochaperones, while only a minor fraction each is downregulated (Figures S2A,B). Overall, chaperones tend to be more upregulated than co-chaperones (Figure S2B). Consistently, within the group of chaperones, we find an overall preponderance of upregulation of both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent chaperones, while only small fractions each are downregulated (Figures S2C,D). The 50 ATP-dependent chaperones are more upregulated than the 38 ATP-independent chaperones, while ATP-independent chaperones are more downregulated than ATP-dependent chaperones (Figure S2D).</p>
<p>Together, this analysis exposes a sub-group of cancers as notable exceptions to these trends, suggesting fundamental differences in chaperome deregulation. Projection of TCGA cancer groups by chaperone and co-chaperone up- and downregulation lends support for two groups of cancers, Group 1 and Group 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These groups are recapitulated when projecting cancers by up- and downregulation of ATP-dependent versus ATP-independent chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). K-means clustering confirms the significant separation of the Group 2 cancers pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and the three kidney cancers kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) from Group 1 cancers, with a median silhouette width of s &#x003D; 0.63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and <italic>s</italic> &#x003D; 0.68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Group 1 cancers (red) represent the majority of cancers, characterized by strong overall chaperome upregulation, with low chaperone and co-chaperone repression, and a trend for upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). Five Group 2 cancers however partition more distantly, with a lack of chaperome upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). These cancers include three different kidney cancers, KICH, KIRP, and KIRC, which consistently lack chaperome upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Also, ATP-dependent chaperones are not preferentially upregulated in kidney cancers. Rather, an inverse trend is observed with increased downregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Notably also, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), rare related tumors of orthosympathetic origin, similarly show an even more prominent inverse alteration, with a preponderance of overall chaperome downregulation and preferential downregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones. Pheochromocytomas originate in the adrenal medulla, with close spatial association to the kidney, whose cancers are also Group 2 cancers. THCA is similar to PCPG, with a preferential downregulation of the chaperome. PCPG and THCA represent tumors forming from cells of neuroendocrine origin, and are both characterized by inverted overall chaperome alteration signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p>

<title>Proteasome and TRiC/CCT Upregulation in Cancers Reminisces Enhanced Stem Cell Proteostasis</title>
<p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are characterized by their capacity to replicate infinitely in culture, while maintaining a pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miura et al. 2004</xref>). This immortal, undifferentiated phenotype resembles hallmark features of cancer cells such as an elevated global translational rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">You et al. 2015</xref>) and is expected to demand increased PN capacity capable of buffering imbalances to maintain proteostasis. Given the &#x201C;sternness&#x201D; phenotype of cancer cells and their resemblances with pluripotent stem cells we hypothesized that the consistent chaperome upregulation in cancers acts to mimic an enhanced stem cell PN setup. Increased proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vilchez et al. 2012</xref>) and elevated overall levels of the TRiC/CCT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>) have recently been associated with the intrinsic PN of pluripotent stem cells that acts to support their identity and immortality. It can be hypothesized that increased levels of central PN processes in stem cells exemplify characteristics of an enhanced PN setup. We thus assessed to which extent this stem cell PN setup is recapitulated in cancers.</p>
<p>First, we assessed differential changes of the proteasome across TCGA cancers and observed an overall consistent upregulation of the 43 proteasomal genes (HGNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gray et al. 2015</xref>) in &#x003E; 70&#x0025; of cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, Table S1B), matching the role of increased proteasomal activity for proteome maintenance in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vilchez et al. 2012</xref>). Notably, Group 1 and Group 2 cancers, which are specifically defined based on chaperome differential expression signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), do not co-partition with cancer clusters obtained by proteasome differential expression. Next, we assessed cancer differential expression of the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT, a hetero-oligomeric complex of two stacked rings with each eight paralogous subunits representing the cytoplasmic ATP-driven HSP60 chaperones in charge of folding approximately 10&#x0025; of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lopez et al. 2015</xref>). TRiC/CCT is highly conserved and essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lopez et al. 2015</xref>). Loss of complex subunits induces cell death and a decline of pluripotency of hESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>). Within the PN, TRiC/CCT mediated folding and autophagic clearance act in concert to prevent aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pavel et al. 2016</xref>). TRiC/CCT levels decline during stem cell differentiation, and CCT8 acts as complex assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>). Intrigued by the finding that CCT8 is the most highly elevated subunit in stem cells and likely acting as TRiC/CCT assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>), we assessed differential expression of individual TRiC/CCT subunits across cancers. Hierarchical clustering of subunit expression across solid cancers highlighted CCT8 as highly consistently upregulated across all cancers (mean change &#x003D; 0.76, <italic>t</italic> test), and as overall second most highly upregulated subunit besides CCT6A (mean change &#x003D; 0.786, <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistent with the overall preferential downregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones observed in Group 2 cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we found these cancers to cluster together with overall lowest TRiC/CCT expression, where PCPG stands out with a consistent downregulation of all subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Opposing Chaperome Deregulation in Cancers and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
<p>Overall chaperome upregulation in cancers, with preferential enrichment for upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones, alongside consistent downregulation of sHSPs, is diametrically opposed to chaperome deregulation trends observed in a study of chaperome alterations in human aging brains and in patient brains with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). While sHSPs were the only chaperome family found significantly induced in brain aging and the age-onset neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer&#x2019;s (AD), Huntington&#x2019;s (HD), and Parkinson&#x2019;s (PD) disease, this family is consistently downregulated across cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This opposed chaperome deregulation points towards characteristic and fundamental differences in PN deregulation between disease families.</p>
<p>To investigate this disease group difference further, we applied the analysis outlined for cancers above also on the gene expression datasets that had earlier revealed global chaperome repression in AD, HD, and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Our analysis reproduced the human chaperome as overall downregulated across AD, HD, and PD (-0,20 &#x0394;GSA group mean change, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Delving deeper into chaperome functional subfamilies, we reproduce earlier findings reporting broad repression of the major chaperome functional families except for sHSPs, the only family found strongly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thereby, our analytical workflow reproduces previously observed trends that had been obtained in independent analyses, with different methods. With strong sHSP repression and upregulation of the HSP100, MITO, PFD, HSP60, and HSP90 chaperone families, cancers and neurodegenerative diseases display markedly diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation, not only at the overall chaperome-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), but also with respect to alteration trends of chaperome functional families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>These opposing chaperome deregulation signatures are in line with differing implications of proteostasis alterations in these diseases. While broad chaperome repression and proteostasis functional collapse is associated with aggregation and cytotoxicity of chronically expressed misfolding-prone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>), enhanced proteostasis buffering capacity is associated with &#x201C;sternness&#x201D;, immortality and proliferative potential of both stem and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>). Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests an inverse correlation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Driver et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Musicco et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ou et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Li et al. 2014</xref>), supportive of a potential mechanistic link between opposed chaperome deregulation and the molecular underpinnings of the two disease groups. These global differences in chaperome deregulation call for a systematic and quantitative assessment of PN deregulation dynamics in human diseases.</p>

<title>A Multi-Step Dimension-Reduction Approach Enables Quantitative Visualisation of Chaperome Shifts in Cancer</title>
<p>In light of the diverse signatures of differential chaperome deregulation observed across cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and motivated by the increasing amount of genomics datasets available for cancers and other challenging human diseases, we aimed at reducing data complexity by extracting quantitative indicators of chaperome differential cancer gene expression alterations, while retaining maximum information content.</p>
<p>We devised a principal component analysis (PCA) based two-step dimension reduction approach (Meta-PCA) that facilitates stratification of cancer patient and normal control samples within heterogeneous gene expression datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Meta-PCA first uses tissue-wise PCA analyses to separate cancerous from control samples for individual tissues and maps functional process group gene expression change to the global, or &#x201C;meta&#x201D;, mean expression change across cancers to obtain M-scores as quantitative indices of relative disease gene expression change (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref>). Inherent to the Meta-PCA method, patient-specific genomic variability is averaged out through the use of Meta-PCs derived from the TCGA collection of cancer biopsy samples, yielding mean reference boundaries. Assessing quantitative M-scores obtained through Meta-PCA against differential gene expression (&#x0394;GSA) obtained via GSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we observed an overall significant correlation of 0.7 (Limma package) (Figure S1). In addition to general comparability between results obtained through both methods, Meta-PCA analysis reduces complexity while retaining genomic information. Therefore, we focus on Meta-PCA for quantitative representation of proteostasis alterations in human diseases. We plot differential chaperome changes as M-scores for all cancer samples and chaperome functional families simultaneously using polar plots, such that axes represent functional families or sub-groups, ordered counter-clockwise decreasing from overall highest to lowest group mean change (&#x0394;GSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We obtain the mean of all biopsy samples as reference boundaries for healthy (blue line) and cancer groups (red line) and include the 90&#x0025; confidence interval (CI) (red and blue halos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This quantitative visualisation reduces complexity and highlights relativity of disease gene expression changes at a chaperome-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The polar maps recapitulate characteristic chaperome deregulation signatures in GSA-derived Cluster I cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>), or the inverse trend with overall chaperome downregulation in Cluster III cancers such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). Concordantly, chaperome polar maps reveal characteristic patterns of differential chaperome expression in Group 1 versus Group 2 cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In LUAD, representative of Group 1 cancers, most functional chaperome families are upregulated, while ER chaperones and sHSPs are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). On the contrary, in Group 2 cancers such as PCPG, gene expression of most chaperome functional families is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Inconsistencies between these broad clusters exist, suggesting differences in tissue of origin and molecular underpinnings of respective cancers. However, broad commonalities between distinct cancers originating from the same organ are revealed. For instance, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) share overall similarity, revealing only subtle differences, for instance in HSP40 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, S3). The kidney cancers KICH, KIRP, and KIRC also show similar patterns. As Group 2 cancers, they share and stand out against other cancers with a lack of preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and overall reduced upregulation or downregulation of HSP60s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>, S3). A recent study indeed implicated HSP60 downregulation in tumorigenesis and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma by disrupting mitochondrial proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tang et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Interactome-guided Topographic Maps Highlight Relative Changes of Chaperome Functional Families in Cancers</title>
<p>The integration of disease-related differential transcriptomic changes with the cellular protein interactome network, or the &#x2018;edgotype&#x2019;, is instrumental to our understanding of genotype - phenotype relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sahni et al. 2013</xref>). Towards integrated quantitative views of cancer chaperome deregulation, we curated a high-confidence physical chaperome protein-protein interactome network (CHAP-PPI) to serve as coordinate base grid layout for the analysis of differential chaperome topographies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We start with 328,244 unique human PPIs (edges) between 16,995 proteins (nodes) downloaded from the BioGRID, IntAct, DIP, and MINT databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chatr-Aryamontri et al. 2013</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kerrien et al. 2012</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Salwinski et al. 2004</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Licata et al. 2012</xref>). Zooming in on cancer chaperome alterations in the context of physical interactome wiring, we extracted the CHAP-PPI considering the 332 human chaperome genes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Considering edges with the PSI-MI annotation &#x2018;physical association&#x2019; we obtain 272,367 unique physical edges, of which 666 unique edges connect 220 chaperome nodes. We developed a custom script to curate the high-confidence physical CHAP-PPI, considering edges with multiple pieces of evidence, that is experimental methods or publications (PMIDs), as more reliable than those supported by only a single piece of evidence. The curation script resolves ambiguous database annotation of methods terms through up-propagation within the PSI-MI ontology tree, only accepting uniquely different or rejecting identical experimental evidence. Automated interactome curation results in eight curation levels (L1 - L8), through which we obtain three interactomes of increasing confidence level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). All 666 unique physical edges between 220 chaperome nodes, without curation for type or number of evidence, represent the single evidence chaperome interactome (SE-CHAP). Curating for high-confidence interactions, we obtained a multiple evidence chaperome (ME-CHAP) comprised of 222 unique physical chaperome edges between 128 chaperome nodes, of which a subset of 132 interactions between 96 nodes is supported by multiple different experimental methods (MM-CHAP) (Table S2).</p>
<p>In order to enable focussed views on transcriptomic alterations of top-level chaperome functional families, we collapse individual nodes onto functional family metanodes, and edges shared between families are collapsed as meta-edges such that metanode sizes correspond to the number of family members and meta-edge thickness represents the number of shared interactions between families. We consider meta-interactomes derived from the curated high-confidence ME-CHAP interactome (Table S2), where all meta-nodes corresponding to the 10 functional chaperome families are fully interconnected in a single network component. We set node colour to visualize cancer gene expression changes (M-scores) and applied a force-directed spring layout algorithm to optimize graph layout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kamada and Kawai 1989</xref>). The resulting integrated cancer chaperome meta-interactomes visualize relative chaperome differential changes at reduced complexity across diverse human cancers in the context of physical interactome connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref>, S4). Next, we extract x-y coordinates of the chaperome meta-nodes in the optimized meta-network graph to serve as a 2-dimensional base grid (x-y coordinates) guiding the spatial layout of 3-dimensional chaperome topographic maps of differential chaperome gene expression changes (M-scores) between cancerous and healthy biopsies (z coordinate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref>, S5).</p>

<p>Proteostasis imbalances and functional collapse are implicated in an increasing spectrum of human diseases, setting the stage for systematic analyses of proteostasis network (PN) alterations in disease. Important progress has been made in our understanding of proteostasis biology, building on fundamental insights on conserved proteostasis processes and their role in disease, such as chaperone-assisted protein folding and quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hartl and Hayer-Hartl 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Young et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hartl et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al. 2013</xref>), clearance through autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ohsumi 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Behrends et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Janku et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rubinsztein et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">T&#x00FC;rei et al. 2015</xref>) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McNaught et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Turnbull et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ciechanover 2015</xref>), followed by the appreciation of their concerted action within a conserved tightly regulated PN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balch et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Powers and Balch 2013</xref>). The identification, development and first clinical evaluations of small molecule proteostasis regulators (PR) for therapeutic re-adjustment of proteostasis diseases such as cystic fibrosis represents a novel and powerful therapeutic paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balch et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Powers et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Calamini et al. 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ramsey et al. 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bouchecareilh and Balch 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Silva et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brandvold and Morimoto 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Das et al. 2015</xref>). First investigations have started to explore systems-level quantitative and functional approaches to assess the implications of PN functional arms such as the chaperome in human tissue aging and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Taipale et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Taipale et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rodina et al. 2016</xref>). A precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which PN alterations contribute to disease could open novel therapeutic intervention strategies in a wide spectrum of proteostasis-related diseases. To date, there has been no systematic study addressing the characteristics and extent of PN alterations in human diseases at a systems-level. Cancer prevalence, genetic complexity and heterogeneity represent unmet medical need and a significant challenge to personalized medicine, calling for genome-informed therapeutic intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burrell et al. 2013</xref>). In cancers, mutations and genomic instability inevitably also entail alterations of proteome composition and balance that are far less well explored than the consequences of nucleic sequence alterations. Post-translational alterations at the proteomic level are beyond the reach of DNA repair mechanisms. Proteome instability and pathological alterations in the abundance of key signalling or housekeeping molecules such as kinases, metabolic enzymes or molecular transporters have to be buffered by the PN to ensure cellular survival. The cancerous state poses characteristic requirements on the PN, such as high chaperone levels and elevated proteasome activity in order to ensure for sufficient correction or elimination of aberrant protein species in light of increased translational flux and metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>). Paradoxically however, the characteristics and extent of PN alterations in cancers are largely unexplored and not understood at a systems-level. Cancer cell line global transcriptional characteristics have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Klijn et al. 2015</xref>) and numerous individual studies have assessed alterations of various chaperone and cochaperone expression levels in specific cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jolly and Morimoto 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>). In light of limitations in the clinical translation of hypotheses derived from cell lines and the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in human disease, we argue that precise quantitative maps of proteostasis deregulation in human disease derived directly from clinical biopsy data will enable precise understanding of the role of PN alterations in pathogenesis towards testable hypotheses and rationalised approaches of PR therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balch et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hutt and Balch 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we focused on the human chaperome, a central PN component, and highly conserved facilitator and safeguard of the healthy folded proteome using an expert-curated human chaperome functional gene ontology comprising an ensemble of 332 chaperone and co-chaperone genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>) to systematically characterize chaperome alterations in a representative clinically relevant dataset of 22 human solid cancers with matching healthy tissue, corresponding to over 10,000 patient biopsy samples provided through the TCGA consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weinstein et al. 2013</xref>). We found the human chaperome consistently highly upregulated across the vast majority of cancers assessed. While numerous individual chaperones and co-chaperones have previously been found upregulated in individual cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jolly and Morimoto 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>), this knowledge is not coherently derived from consistent data resources or systematic genome-wide analyses in biopsy tissue. Here, we provide systematic quantitative maps of chaperome deregulation in cancers that highlight the relevance, characteristics and extent of chaperome upregulation in cancers. Our analysis revealed chaperome deregulation signatures that not only feature broad upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones but also consistent repression of ER-specific chaperones and the ATP-independent sHSPs. The data also suggest two cancer groups that can be stratified specifically by their chaperome deregulation patterns. Overall chaperome upregulation across cancers is in agreement with existing evidence on individual chaperones that has been previously reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Morimoto 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fuller et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jolly and Morimoto 2000</xref>). For instance, elevated heat shock protein expression levels have been reported for HSP90 in breast and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jameel et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wong and Wispe 1997</xref>), HSP70 was found increased in breast, oral, cervical and renal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ciocca et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kaur and Ralhan 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ralhan and Kaur 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Santarosa et al. 1997</xref>), and HSP60 showed increased expression in Hodgkin&#x2019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hsu and Hsu 1998</xref>). The cellular safeguarding functions of chaperones are subverted during oncogenesis to facilitate malignant transformation in light of increased translational flux and aberrant protein species in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>). Increased chaperone levels have previously been correlated with poor prognosis and cancer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jameel et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yano et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jolly and Morimoto 2000</xref>). Chronic dependency on stress response and quality control mechanisms drives cancer cells into a phenotype of non-oncogene addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Solimini et al. 2007</xref>). The observed extent of chaperome alterations suggests a broader state of cancer &#x201C;chaperome addiction&#x201D;, beyond the dependency on individual chaperones.</p>
<p>Evidence points towards functional associations between increased proteostasis buffering capacity and maintenance of &#x201C;sternness&#x201D;, immortality and proliferative potential in both cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>). For instance, autophagy was found to maintain &#x201C;sternness&#x201D; by preventing senescence through sustained proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Garcia-Prat et al. 2016</xref>). Increased proteasomal activity and elevated levels of the HSP60 chaperonin complex TRiC/CCT have recently been linked to stem cell identity by conferring proteostasis robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vilchez et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>). Fundamental similarities between stem cells and cancer raise the question to the extent of similarity between cancer and stem cell PN states and capacity. Our data suggest that cancers consistently display signatures of elevated proteostasis functional processes such as the chaperome and proteasome-mediated clearance, and are in agreement with the hypothesis that upregulated clearance mechanisms such as the proteasome and increased chaperome topologies, particularly increases in ATP-driven chaperones such as the HSP60 chaperonin complex TRiC/CCT, confer increased proteostasis capacity and survival benefits to cancer cells just like they are essential to stem cell biology. Precise knowledge of systems-level network deregulation therefore sheds light on fundamental processes at play from stem cell biology to cancerogenesis. Chaperone upregulation is largely regulated through heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dai et al. 2007</xref>). Overexpression of the TRiC/CCT subunit CCT8 protects against <italic>hsf-1</italic> knockdown in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>), consistent with a regulatory connection between TRiC/CCT and HSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Neef et al. 2014</xref>). Connecting processes at the PN level, this evidence suggests a connection between TRiC/CCT and HSF1 stress response signalling also in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mendillo et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Noormohammadi et al. 2016</xref>). While increased expression of TRiC/CCT subunits has been observed in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boudiaf-Benmammar et al. 2013</xref>), and increases in CCT8 expression are linked to individual cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Qiu et al. 2015</xref>), we describe consistent TRiC/CCT upregulation within global cancer chaperome signatures throughout the majority of TCGA solid cancers, or Group 1 cancers, whereas Group 2 cancers lack chaperome and, to large extent, TRiC/CCT upregulation.</p>
<p>Contrary to stem cell proteostasis, which is set up to maintain pluripotency and proliferative capacity, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s (AD), Huntington&#x2019;s (HD), and Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (PD) display signs of proteostasis functional collapse. Misfolding diseases feature overexpression of aggregation - prone proteins such as A&#x03B2; in AD, &#x03B1;-synuclein in PD, or huntingtin in HD that entail a &#x201C;toxic-gain-of-function&#x201D; resulting in chaperome overload, gradually exceeding proteostasis capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Knowles et al. 2014</xref>), while &#x201C;loss-of-function&#x201D; misfolding diseases feature specific perturbations such as dysfunctional &#x0394;F508-CFTR in cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chanoux and Rubenstein 2012</xref>). Functionally deficient steady-state dynamics of the folding environment affect cellular protein repair capacity and proteome maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wang et al. 2006</xref>). Most cancer cells however harbour manifold genetic aberrations even at the karyotype level that likely entail dramatic effects on proteome balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harper and Bennett 2016</xref>). The collective damage caused by oncoprotein expression, compromised DNA repair, genomic instability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevated global translation and chaperome overload triggers stress response mechanisms in light of a challenged cellular proteostasis capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Csermely 2001</xref>). Chaperome deregulation dynamics observed in cancers indeed display concordantly opposed trends as compared to alterations in the major neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>A recent study linked repression of &#x223C;30&#x0025; of the human chaperome in aging brains and in neurodegenerative diseases to proteostasis functional collapse and pointed to the role of a chaperome sub-network as a conserved proteostasis safeguard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, while only &#x223C;8&#x0025; of the human orthologous chaperome had protective phenotypes upon functional perturbation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> models of amyloid &#x03B2; (A&#x03B2;) and polyQ proteotoxicity, chaperones and co-chaperones far less well studied than HSP90 had equally strong protective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). Similarly, an overlap between the chaperome and the &#x201C;essentialome&#x201D; set of 1,658 core fitness genes in K562 leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wang et al. 2015</xref>) found only 55 overlapping with the 332 chaperome genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balchin et al. 2016</xref>). Interestingly, HSP60s showed the highest fraction of essential chaperones in agreement with their function as a highly conserved folding complex that hosts &#x223C;10&#x0025; of the proteome&#x2019;s clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lopez et al. 2015</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest a highly functionally redundant and robust role of the central conserved chaperome within the PN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brehme and Voisine 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our study showcases a systematic profiling of the extent of chaperome deregulation, as a central PN functional arm, in a panel of human cancers and three major neurodegenerative disorders, accompanied by a resource of quantitative multi-dimensional maps with reduced complexity. Therapeutic PN regulation for increased or restored proteostasis capacity may be beneficial in both loss-of-function and gain-of-toxic-function diseases of protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Powers et al. 2009</xref>). Attenuating the PN on the other hand, such as inhibiting chaperones like HSP70 and HSP90 or the UPS clearance machinery, are widely acknowledged as promising therapeutic avenues in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whitesell and Lindquist 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miyata et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balchin et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al. 2016</xref>). While this manuscript was in preparation, Rodina and co-workers reported findings on a highly integrated chaperome subnetwork, or &#x2018;epichaperome&#x2019;, as a classifier of cancers with high sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition, while cancers with a less interconnected chaperome are less vulnerable by HSP90 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rodina et al. 2016</xref>). Several HSP90 inhibitors have shown encouraging results in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Khajapeer and Baskaran 2015</xref>). Our study further supports the central role of the chaperome in PN biology, justifying particular focus on understanding chaperome alterations in human diseases at a systems level. The characteristic signatures of cancer chaperome alterations revealed in this study suggest broad commonalities and differences that could serve as testable hypotheses for therapeutic chaperome targeting strategies in cancer. Our results underline the value of charting quantitative systems-level maps and provide a resource towards an improved functional understanding of proteostasis biology in health and disease. A systems-level understanding of contextual PN alterations throughout the human diseasome will be instrumental for charting a clearer picture of the PN as a therapeutic target space, and as a resource for clinical biomarkers, including the chaperome. In face of increasing amounts of genome-scale disease data we are confronted with tremendous challenges of data complexity. Therefore, our study provides Proteostasis Profiler (Pro<sup>2</sup>), an integrated web-based suite of tools enabling processing, analysis and visualisation of proteostasis alterations in human diseases at reduced dimensionality, towards hypotheses-building for mechanistic understanding and clinical translation.</p>

<title>Gene Expression Data Preparation</title>
<p>Focussing on pan-cancer analysis of the human chaperome, we chose The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as the main source for our analyses, as an established dataset that is widely used and adopted by the scientific community. The Broad Institute TCGA GDAC Firehose was accessed to download TCGA RNAseqv2 raw counts data followed by application of the voom method for the transformation of count data to normalized log2-counts per million (logCPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Law et al. 2014</xref>). Each of these logCPM values were centered gene-wise for sample normalization and comparability and used for all analyses. Considering TCGA clinical data annotation, we extracted those 22 tissue biopsy group datasets that provide both &#x201C;primary solid tumor&#x201D; and &#x201C;solid tissue normal&#x201D; sample type annotations.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Gene Set Analysis (GSA) and Heatmap Representation</title>
<p>We applied Gene Set Analysis (GSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Efron and Tibshirani 2007</xref>), an advanced derivative of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Subramanian et al. 2005</xref>), in order to assess chaperome gene family expression changes between cancerous and corresponding healthy tissue samples. When applying GSA, we implemented 100 permutations of chaperome genes contained in each functional family in order to allow for statistical assessment of differential expression upon re-standardization of gene groups for more accurate inferences. Results are displayed as heatmaps indicating significance of up or down-regulation of gene expression as &#x0394;GSA values derived from the difference of (1 - upregulation p value) - (1 - downregulation p value) in disease compared to matching healthy tissue for TCGA cancer datasets, or control patient biopsies for neurodegenerative disease datasets (AD, HD, PD). &#x0394;GSA values are normalized within the interval [&#x2212;1, &#x002B;1], where &#x2018;&#x002B;1&#x2019; indicates significant upregulation (upregulation p value &#x003D; 0), while &#x2018;&#x2212;1&#x2019; indicates significant down-regulation (downregulation p value &#x003D; 0), accordingly. Bar graphs represent group mean changes of each chaperome functional family gene group over all diseases.</p>

<title>Linear Modeling of Chaperome Functional Subsets</title>
<p>We subdivided the human chaperome into functional subsets of chaperones and cochaperones, and further divided chaperones into two sets of ATP-dependent and ATP-independent chaperones according to the annotations provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>).

<title>Meta-Principal Component Analysis (Meta-PCA)</title>
<p>Gene Set Analysis (GSA) is a statistical hypothesis testing method that is by definition limited to confirmatory data analysis with respect to pre-existing hypotheses. In order to serve the goal of quantitative exploratory pan-cancer chaperome analysis, while retaining a maximum information content during model reduction, we devised a quantitative multi-step dimension reduction model fitting strategy based on principal component analysis (PCA). Principal component analysis (PCA) uses orthogonal transformation to convert a set of variables to linearly uncorrelated variables, such that they are ordered by their information content, which allows for removal of dimensions with lowest information content for dimensionality reduction in complex heterogeneous datasets. In order to stratify cancer from healthy biopsy gene expression samples based on chaperome functional family gene expression in highly convoluted datasets comprising multiple different cancer types, we designed a novel two-step &#x2018;Meta-PCA&#x2019; method capable of handling this type of heterogeneous data. We hypothesized that each chaperome functional family or process can be described by a low number of variable dimensions, considering that genes within each group are either related or act together in molecular complexes. Therefore, we used a PCA-based approach for quantitative assessment and dimensionality reduction of functional chaperome alterations based on disease gene expression data. Challenged by highly varying sample counts in the different TCGA cancer group datasets, where datasets (tissues) with high sample numbers are at risk of dominating PCA results as compared to cancer groups with low sample numbers, we developed a custom approach that is not limited by a lack of underlying models for interpolation or undesirable loss of information, such as in up- or down-sampling, respectively, allowing us to consider all samples in the included TCGA cancer groups. Assuming distinct roles for each chaperome functional group we define
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="122044_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula> where <italic>M</italic> denotes the M-score of chaperome (CHAP) family <italic><sc>x</sc></italic>, <italic>G<sub>x</sub></italic> is the vector of gene expression values corresponding to genes in CHAP family <italic><sc>x</sc></italic>, and <italic>F<sub>x</sub></italic> is the function we want to fit. For simplicity, we considered a linear first degree model as follows: <italic>F<sub>x</sub></italic> is a vector of weights <italic>W<sub>x</sub></italic> with identical length as the vector <italic>G<sub>x</sub></italic>, and we aim to find <italic>W<sub>x</sub></italic> for all <italic><sc>x</sc></italic> using PCA. Assuming equivalent biological function of each <italic>CHAP<sub>x</sub></italic>. among all tissues, we first calculate <italic>F<sub>x</sub></italic> for each tissue in order to separate disease from healthy samples for each tissue, and then combine all &#x201C;relevant&#x201D; PCs in order to obtain the main underlying PC, or &#x2018;Meta-PC&#x2019;, of the corresponding CHAP group. We outline the &#x2018;Meta-PCA&#x2019; algorithm as follows:

<list-item><label>Step 1:</label>
<p>Assuming <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="122044_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> can be approximated using PC1, we assume <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="122044_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is equal to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="122044_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, which is the vector of weights for CHAP group <sc>x</sc> and tissue <italic>t</italic>.

<p>The <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="122044_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> assumption in Step 1 is not necessarily true; PCA extracts the most variable direction in GEX, but in case CHAP group <italic><sc>x</sc></italic> does not change drastically between healthy and cancer, PC1 will represent an unwanted variable or even noise. So we have to filter out the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="122044_inline9.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> that did not fit well to the data.

<title>Physical Protein-Protein Interactome Network Assembly and Curation</title>
<p>Human physical protein - protein interactions (PPIs), hereafter referred to as &#x2018;edges&#x2019;, were downloaded on 23 Dec 2016 from the BioGRID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chatr-Aryamontri et al. 2013</xref>), IntAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kerrien et al. 2012</xref>), DIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Salwinski et al. 2004</xref>), and MINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Licata et al. 2012</xref>) databases. In order to obtain a high confidence chaperome physical protein - protein interactome network, we developed a custom Python script to curate raw interactome pairs, or edges, as downloaded from the above databases, considering edges detected by multiple experimental methods as more reliable than those detected by only a single method. Similarly, edges supported by multiple publications are considered at higher confidence than edges supported by only one study. Edges supported by multiple methods and / or multiple studies are collectively referred to as &#x2018;multiple evidence&#x2019; (ME), of which those identified by multiple different methodologies represent a subset of highest confidence (MM). The Python script processes the interactome raw data as follows: UniProt IDs are mapped to NCBI Entrez Gene IDs and for each human PPI between any two chaperome members (nodes), interacting partners are mapped to Gene IDs. Only edges annotated with PSI-MI term &#x2018;physical association&#x2019; type are considered. Eight different curation levels exist:
<table-wrap id="utbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="122044_utbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>Considering these curation levels, three physical chaperome (CHAP) interactomes of increasing confidence level are obtained (Table S2):
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>(1) SE-CHAP:</label>
<p>666 unique physical edges between 220 nodes without curation for type or number of evidence (single evidence SE-CHAP)</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>(2) ME-CHAP:</label>
<p>222 unique physical edges between 128 nodes with multiple pieces of evidence detected by &#x2265; 2 different experimental methods OR reported by &#x2265; 2 independent studies (PMIDs) (multiple evidence ME-CHAP)</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>(3) MM-CHAP:</label>
<p>132 unique physical edges between 96 nodes detected by &#x2265; 2 different experimental methods only (multiple method MM-CHAP).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Different PPI source databases may annotate an identical reported PPI to different PSI-MI terms situated at different depth of the same branch within the PSI-MI ontology tree. In these cases, PPIs that are actually only supported by one piece of evidence can unintentionally be mislabelled as multiple evidence PPIs. Our automated quality curation script resolves this problem through up-propagation within the PSI-MI - ontology tree. Assume one PPI is annotated with two different interaction detection methods, A and B, then 1) if PSI-MI ontology tree levels of method A and method B are identical but their PSI-MI terms (IDs) are different, then the methods are considered as different, otherwise A and B are considered the same and the interaction is eliminated from the MM-CHAP interactome, 2) if the level of method A is higher (deeper in the ontology tree) than the level of method B, then the code searches for its parent situated at the same level as method B and compares the parent method ID with B to determine if the methods are identical or different.</p>

<title>Interactome-Guided 3-D Topographic Maps</title>
<p>We consider 2-dimensional physical interactome information to guide the spatial layout (x-y coordinates) of human chaperome functional ontology families in a 3-dimensional (x-y-z coordinates) topographic representation of chaperome M-score changes between disease and healthy tissue (z coordinate). Physical chaperome protein-protein interactome network data (PPIs) was obtained and curated as described above. We considered a network involving only high quality curated interactions supported by multiple pieces of evidence (ME-CHAP). We used the R package iGraph in order to collapse nodes corresponding to each level 1 functional ontology family into meta-nodes, and edges shared between all members of any two different level 1 functional families into meta-edges, such that metanode size corresponds to the number of family members and meta-edge thickness represents the number of shared interactions between two families. Meta-node colour is set to reflect gene expression changes of each respective functional family in disease. We then applied a force-directed network graph layout algorithm to the meta-network according to Kamada and Kawai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kamada and Kawai 1989</xref>) and extracted resulting x-y coordinates of each family meta-node in the network. We use Python to draw the meta-network according to the parameters obtained in iGraph to serve as interactome-guided base grid for disease-specific quantitative 3-dimensional topographic network representations. To this end we expand the 2-dimensional network landscape with Meta-PCA derived chaperome M-score values (z coordinate).</p>

<title>Proteostasis Profiler (Pro<sup>2</sup>) Web-Tool</title>
<p>We designed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler (Pro<sup>2</sup>) in order to enable visual exploration of the data and results described in this manuscript, obtained through our algorithms and visualisation tools. Pro<sup>2</sup> is accessible directly at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteostasys.org">http://www.proteostasys.org</ext-link> or through the resources collection at the Joint Research Center for Computational Biomedicine (JRC-COMBINE) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.combine.rwth-aachen.de/index.php/resources.html">http://www.combine.rwth-aachen.de/index.php/resources.html</ext-link>. Pro<sup>2</sup> is implemented using Django (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">https://www.djangoproject.com/</ext-link>), a web framework written in Python language (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</ext-link>). All the charts in the tool are made using the plotly platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plot.ly">https://plot.ly</ext-link>). The Pro<sup>2</sup> tool itself is hosted on the Heroku platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.heroku.com">https://www.heroku.com</ext-link>) and related code is available at the Github repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/brehmelab/Pro2">https://github.com/brehmelab/Pro2</ext-link>.</p>

Correlation of Chaperome GSA and Meta-PCA scores.</bold> Correlation between GSA-scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Efron and Tibshirani 2007</xref>) and Meta-PCA T-statistic values derived using Limma linear modelling on all TCGA cancer groups considered in this study indicates overall correlation (cor &#x003D; 0.656).</p>
<p><bold>Figure S2. Preferential Chaperome Upregulation in Cancers.</bold> Analysis of differential cancer gene expression of chaperome functional subsets, comparing chaperones and co-chaperones as well as ATP-dependent and ATP-independent chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brehme et al. 2014</xref>). See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. <bold>A.</bold> Comparing upregulation and downregulation of gene expression of chaperones and co-chaperones using GSA reveals a general upregulation of chaperones and co-chaperones in cancer, with preferential upregulation of chaperones. Colour code indicates chaperone up-regulation of gene expression. Axes represent chaperone downregulation, co-chaperone upregulation and downregulation of gene expression. <bold>B.</bold> Box-and-whisker plots highlight fractions of differentially expressed genes in each chaperome subset for all TCGA cancers assessed, based on A. Differentially expressed genes in each set were obtained by linear modelling (Limma package in R) and considering genes with p value &#x003C; 0.5 following Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Box boundaries, 25&#x0025; and 75&#x0025; quartiles; middle horizontal line, median; whiskers, quartile boundaries for values beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range; small circle, outlier. <bold>C.</bold> Assessing differential expression of ATP-dependent (n &#x003D; 50) vs. ATP-independent (n &#x003D; 38) chaperones highlights a preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones across TCGA cancers <bold>D.</bold> Box plots (drawn as in B.) show fractions of differentially expressed genes in the two sets of ATP-dependent and ATP-independent chaperones for all TCGA cancers assessed, based on C.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S3. Compendium of Cancer Chaperome Polar Maps.</bold> Chaperome gene expression shifts between healthy and cancer tissue biopsy datasets are quantified by Meta-PCA and visualized in context by plotting resulting M-scores on polar maps as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Blue (healthy) and red (cancer) lines represent means across all samples for each cancer. Halos represent confidence interval at the 90&#x0025; quantile range (5&#x0025; - 95&#x0025;). Axes are ordered counter-clockwise by overall mean decrease of expression across cancers.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S4. Compendium of Cancer Chaperome Interactome Meta-Networks.</bold> Cancer-specific chaperome meta-interactome networks are shown as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Multiple-evidence chaperome (ME-CHAP) edges and nodes are collapsed onto meta-edges and meta-nodes. Node size and edge thickness correspond to the number of functional family member nodes and the sum of the number of inter-family edges, respectively. Node colour indicates combined cancer gene expression changes quantified via Meta-PCA.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S5. Compendium of Cancer Chaperome 3-D Topographic Maps.</bold> 3D topographic maps of cancer chaperome alterations are obtained by projecting gene expression changes between cancerous and healthy counterpart biopsy gene expression (z dimension) onto the high-confidence chaperome meta-interactome (ME-CHAP) graph layout (x-y dimensions).</p>
