<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is one of the leading causes of invasive fungal infection in humans worldwide. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> can use macrophages as a proliferative niche to increase infective burden and avoid immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms by which <italic>C. neoformans</italic> manipulates host immunity to promote its growth during infection remain ill-defined. Here we demonstrate a key role for eicosanoid lipid mediators produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in regulating host responses. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is known to secrete several eicosanoids that are highly similar to those found in vertebrate hosts. Using the eicosanoid deficient cryptococcal mutant <italic>&#x0394;plb1,</italic> we demonstrate that prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is required by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> for proliferation within macrophages and, using our zebrafish model of cryptococcosis, we confirm this role for PGE<sub>2</sub> <italic>in vivo.</italic> Furthermore, we show that PGE<sub>2</sub> must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> to promote fungal growth. We find that activation of the intracellular 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor PPAR-&#x03B3; promotes fungal burden in zebrafish suggesting that cryptococcal 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is a novel virulence factor that may act as an agonist for PPAR-&#x03B3;.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is responsible for significant numbers of deaths in the immunocompromised population worldwide. Here we address whether eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> manipulate host innate immune cells during infection. <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> produces a number of eicosanoids that are notable for their similarity to vertebrate eicosanoids, it is therefore possible that fungal-derived eicosanoids may mimic physiological effects in the host. Using a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models we identify a specific eicosanoid species - prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; that is required by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> for growth during infection. We subsequently find that prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> must be converted to 15-keto prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> within the host before it has these effects. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the mechanism of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>/15-keto prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> mediated virulence is via activation of host PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> &#x2013; an intracellular eicosanoid receptor known to interact with 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen and that infects individuals who have severe immunodeficiencies such as late-stage HIV infection. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is estimated to infect up to 1 million individuals each year globally and causes hundreds of thousands of deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection begins as a respiratory infection but in the absence of an effective immune response the fungus disseminates to the central nervous system causing meningitis, and eventually death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans</italic> initially grows within the alveolar spaces of the lungs as budding yeast before it is phagocytosed by macrophages. In normal immunity, macrophages must become activated by further inflammatory signals from the host immune system before they can effectively kill <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). When this does not occur macrophages cannot kill <italic>C. neoformans;</italic> instead the fungus is able to proliferate rapidly intracellularly and may use macrophages to disseminate to the central nervous system where it causes fatal meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>An important group of inflammatory mediators produced during the initial stages of microbial infection by macrophages are eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are a diverse group of potent lipid signalling molecules that have a short range of action and communicate through autocrine or paracrine routes. During infection macrophages produce large amounts of a particular group of eicosanoids called prostaglandins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Prostaglandins have a number of physiological effects throughout the body, but in the context of immunity they are known to strongly influence the inflammatory state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Two particular prostaglandins - PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; are the best-studied eicosanoid inflammatory mediators. During infection macrophages produce both PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub> and, via autocrine routes, macrophages are highly responsive to PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In vertebrate immunity, the synthesis of eicosanoids such as PGE<sub>2</sub> is carefully regulated by feedback loops to ensure that the potent effects of these molecules are properly constrained. Exogenous sources of eicosanoids within the body, such as from eicosanoid-producing parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) or tumours that overproduce eicosanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), disrupt host inflammatory signaling as they are not subject to the same regulation.</p>
<p>During infection, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> produces a range of eicosanoid species which are indistinguishable from those produced by their vertebrate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Currently only two <italic>C. neoformans</italic> enzymes - phospholipase B1 and laccase - are known to be associated with cryptococcal eicosanoid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Deletion of phospholipase B1 reduces secreted levels of all eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> suggesting that it has high level role in eicosanoid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), perhaps fulfilling the role of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> in higher organisms. In contrast, it is possible that the cryptococcal enzyme has putative PGE<sub>2</sub> synthase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The synthesis of eicosanoids by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> raises the possibility that the fungus is able to manipulate host inflammation by directly manipulating host eicosanoid signaling during establishment of infection <italic>in vivo.</italic> During respiratory infection of mice, the inhibition of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> receptors EP2 and EP4 leads to better host survival accompanied by a shift towards Th1/M1 macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Therefore, a key aspect of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> pathogenesis remains unanswered; do eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> manipulate host innate immune cells function during infection&#x003F;</p>
<p>We hypothesised that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> were able to promote intracellular proliferation within macrophages and virulence in the host. We have previously shown that the phospholipase B1 deficient strain <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic>, that lacks eicosanoid synthesis, cannot replicate or survive within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Thus, we sought to determine whether this deficiency is directly due to lower levels of eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. To address this question we have combined <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophage infection assays with our previous published <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish model of cryptococcosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Using this approach, we show that prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is sufficient to promote growth of the <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> during <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of macrophages. We find that this eicosanoid is also able to promote growth of <italic>C. neoformans in vivo</italic> but activity requires the dehydrogenation of PGE<sub>2</sub> into 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>, and the activity of the 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>.</p>

<title>C. neoformans prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is required for growth in macrophages</title>
<p>We have shown previously that the <italic>C. neoformans PLB1</italic> gene (coding for the secreted enzyme phospholipase B1) deletion mutant <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) has impaired proliferation and survival during infection of J774 murine macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). It has been proposed that the attenuation of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> could be because this strain cannot produce eicosanoids such as PGE<sub>2</sub> which could be used by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to interfere with macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>To establish if <italic>C. neoformans</italic> requires PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis for growth within macrophages we investigated whether the intracellular proliferation defect of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> could be rescued with the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> to infected cells. We found that the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> to <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> infected J774 macrophages was sufficient to partially recover the intracellular proliferation rate (IPR) of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> compared to its parental strain H99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). These findings support our hypothesis that eicosanoid synthesis by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is required to promote proliferation of the fungus during macrophage infection, furthermore they identify PGE<sub>2</sub> as a mediator of cryptococcal virulence during macrophage infection.</p>

<title>Phospholipase B1 dependent secreted factors are produced by C. neoformans to promote macrophage infection</title>
<p>After finding that PGE<sub>2</sub> is required by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to proliferate within macrophages, we next wanted to determine whether <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is the source of this growth promoting factor during macrophage infection. To test if <italic>C. neoformans</italic> produces phospholipase B1 dependent secretary factors, such as PGE<sub>2</sub>, to promote intacellular growth we used a co-infection&#x2019; assay which has previously been used to investigate the interaction of different <italic>C. gattii</italic> strains within the same macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). If the parental strain H99 produces growth promoting factors that <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> cannot, we reasoned that <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> cells would display improved intracellular replication when H99 was also present within the same macrophage.</p>
<p>To produce co-infection, we infected macrophages with a 50:50 mixture of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> and H99-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B i</xref>; as described previously for <italic>C. gattii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)). The intracellular proliferation of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> was calculated by counting the change in number of non-fluorescent <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> cells over an 18hr period from time-lapse movies of infected cells. Although we infected our macrophages with a 50:50 mixture of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> and H99-GFP we found that co-infected macrophages did not always contain the same ratio of each strain. To control for differences in burden between macrophages, we only scored macrophages that had an initial burden of two <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> yeast cells to one H99-GFP yeast cell or vice versa. Interestingly we found that <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) proliferated better when accompanied by two H99-GFP yeast cells in the same macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 B ii, 1:2</xref>) as opposed to when two <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> yeast cells were accompanied by one H99-GFP yeast cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 B ii, 2:1</xref>). This suggests that there is a secreted factor produced by H99, but absent in <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> that can promote intracellular proliferation within macrophages.</p>

To use <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> with our zebrafish larvae infection model we generated a constitutively expressed GFP tagged version of the <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> (<italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic>). We next evaluated the growth of <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic>-GFP by infecting zebrafish larval with <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic>&#x2014;GFP and measuring the growth of the fungus at 1,2 and 3 days post infection (dpi). Analysis of fungal burden revealed that <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic>-GFP had a lower fungal burden at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection compared to the parental strain H99-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A, C</xref>). These data show that the <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> mutant has a similar growth deficiency in our <italic>in</italic> vivo model to our <italic>in vitro</italic> data and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>After confirming that fungal burden is reduced <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next wanted to investigate if this phenotype was due to an inability to generate PGE<sub>2</sub>. We treated <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> and H99 infections with PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub> tends to produce context-dependent opposing immune signalling to PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)). PGE<sub>2</sub>, but not PGD<sub>2</sub>, increased fungal burden of both the parental H99 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>, p &#x003D; 0.0137, 1.35-fold increase vs. DMSO) and the <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2F</xref>, p &#x003D; 0.0001, 2.15-fold increase vs. DMSO). Taken together these data show that PGE<sub>2</sub> is required for growth <italic>in vivo;</italic> this is in agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings suggesting that growth <italic>in vivo</italic> may rely on eicosanoid production during macrophage infection.</p>

<title>15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes C. neoformans growth by activating host PPAR-&#x03B3;</title>
<p>We next wanted to determine if 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is able to promote cryptococcal growth by interfering with host eicosanoid signalling pathways. 16,16-dimethyl PGE<sub>2</sub> signals through the same host receptors as PGE<sub>2</sub> so its lack of activity in this system strongly suggests different molecular pathways for 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub>. With 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> has been reported as an agonist at the peroxisome proliferation associated receptor gamma (PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>); a transcription factor that controls expression of many inflammation related. To determine if 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes the growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> during host infection by activating host PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> we treated infected larvae with a specific agonist of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> - Troglitazone (TLT) - at a concentration (0.55 &#x03BC;M) shown to strongly activate PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We found that TLT treatment produced a significantly increased the fungal burden of <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> (Fig 5B and 5D, p &#x003D; 0.0089, 1.68-fold increase vs. DMSO) and H99-GFP (Fig 5A and 5C, p &#x003D; 0.0044, 1.46-fold increase vs. DMSO) infected larvae similar to 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment. These findings suggest that 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes fungal growth by activating PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> are required for virulence both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic> We have shown that the intracellular growth defect of <italic>&#x0394;plb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)</italic> can be rescued with the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, with our co-infection experiments we provide evidence that the source of this eicosanoid during infection is from the pathogen, rather than the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 B</xref>). Using a zebrafish larvae <italic>in vivo</italic> model of cryptococcosis we have gone on to show that a recently described fungal burden defect during larval infection can also be rescued with the addition of PGE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). Additionally we find that that PGE2 appears to require dehydrogenated into 15-keto PGE2 before it has a biological effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Finally, we provide evidence that the mechanism of PGE2/15-keto PGE2 mediated growth promotion during larval infection may be via the activation of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> &#x2013; an intracellular receptor within macrophages that 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> is thought to activate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have identified an unknown mechanism used by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> to manipulate host innate immunity whereby eicosanoids secreted by the fungus are able to manipulate the function of macrophages and promote fungal growth in the host through 15-keto PGE2 and the host receptor PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>.</p>
<p>We have previously identified that the <italic>PLB1</italic> gene deletion mutant <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> was deficient in replication and survival in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), an observation also supported by a number of studies using different <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In this study we have shown that the treating <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> infected macrophages with exogenous prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is sufficient to restore intracellular proliferation of <italic>&#x0394;plb1.</italic> During cryptococcal respiratory infection it has been observed that PGE<sub>2</sub> levels increase significantly in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Our study identifies cryptococci as the source of PGE<sub>2</sub> and additionally it identifies the direct effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> on <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> intracellular proliferation, confirming PGE<sub>2</sub> as virulence factor required for growth in macrophages. As a PGE<sub>2</sub> is a phospholipase B1 dependent factor we hypothesised that co-infection would also be sufficient to recover intracellular growth in macrophages. Analysis of complementary ratios of mutant to parental strain numbers in co-infected macrophages demonstrated rescue, supporting our conclusion that cryptococcal derived PGE<sub>2</sub> is required for virulence.</p>
<p>A key goal of this study was to investigate how eicosanoids produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> may affect pathogenesis within a living host. We chose to use a zebrafish larvae model of cryptococcosis that our group has recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). To facilitate non-invasive fungal burden measurement within live larvae we created a GFP-tagged <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> strain with constitutive expression (<italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic>) to use alongside the GFP-tagged H99 parental strain we have previously produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To our knowledge this is the first GFP tagged version of tagged <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> created, and it also represents one of the only examples of a fluorescently tagged mutant <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strain. Characterisation of tagged <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> using our zebrafish model of cryptococcosis revealed that this strain also has significantly reduced growth <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to H99-GFP, these findings confirm findings from a similar zebrafish cryptococcosis model which also found that tagged <italic>&#x0394;plb1</italic> (non-fluorescent) had attenuated burden during larval infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>To ascertain whether PGE<sub>2</sub> is also required for cryptococcal growth <italic>in vivo</italic> we treated zebrafish larvae infected with <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> or H99-GFP with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. In agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings we found that PGE<sub>2</sub> significantly improved the growth of <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> within larvae. Interestingly we also found that PGE<sub>2</sub> improved the growth of our H99-GFP parental control perhaps representing a wider manipulation of host immunity in <italic>in vivo</italic> infection. During larval infection, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> interacts closely with macrophages, it is therefore likely that the PGE<sub>2</sub> dependent growth observed in our <italic>in vivo</italic> model is due to host macrophage manipulation facilitated by <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> derived eicosanoids.</p>
<p>In vertebrate cells, PGE<sub>2</sub> is converted into 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> by the dehydrogenase enzyme 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15PGDH). To determine whether the biological effect we observed with PGE<sub>2</sub> were affected by the conversion of to PGE<sub>2</sub> or 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> we treated infected larvae with 16,16 dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; a synthetic variant of PGE<sub>2</sub> which is resistant to dehydrogenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Interestingly we found that 16,16 dm &#x2013; PGE<sub>2</sub> was not able to promote the growth of <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> or H99-GFP within infected larvae. These findings indicated that 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>, rather than PGE<sub>2</sub>, was the bioactive molecule during cryptococcal infection. To confirm these findings, we treated infected larvae with exogenous 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and found that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment was sufficient to promote the growth of both <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> and H99-GFP without the need for PGE<sub>2</sub>. We propose that PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is enzymatically dehyodrogenated into 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>, as previously mentioned the vertebrate enzyme 15PGDH can convert PGE<sub>2</sub> into 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>, additionally it has been reported that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> itself has enzymatic activity analogous to 15PGDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), therefore it is possible that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> may produce both PGE<sub>2</sub> and 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub>. These findings represent the identification of a new virulence factor produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> as well as the first time that an eicosanoid other than PGE<sub>2</sub> has been identified as promoting cryptococcal growth. Furthermore, our findings suggest that previous studies which identify PGE<sub>2</sub> as a promoter of cryptococcal virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) may have observed multiplicative effects from both PGE<sub>2</sub> and 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> activity.</p>
<p>The biological activity of 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> is far less studied than its parent species PGE<sub>2</sub>. 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> is unable to bind to the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> EP receptors which means that one of its physiological functions is to act as a negative regulator of PGE<sub>2</sub> activity i.e. cells up-regulate 15PGDH activity to lower PGE<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Asour findings showed that 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> does have an effect during <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection, we next sought the cellular receptor for 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>. With this in mind it has been demonstrated that 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> is an agonist for the intracellular eicosanoid receptor peroxisome proliferator associated receptor gamma (PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> is a nuclear receptor normally found within the cytosol, upon ligand binding PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> forms a heterodimer with Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and translocates to the nucleus where it influences the expression of target genes which possess a peroxisome proliferation hormone response element (PPRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>Activation of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has not been described previously but agrees with what we know of cryptococcal pathogenesis. PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> is an intracellular receptor found in many cell types including macrophages, if eicosanoids are being produced by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> during intracellular infection it is also likelier that they have bind to an eicosanoid receptor within the macrophage. Finally, activation of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> promotes the expression of genes that are anti-inflammatory, and in macrophages PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> activation can lead to alternative activation. The growth promoting effects of 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> and the identification of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> as a receptor for PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> led us to hypothesise that the effect of 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> could be mediated by PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> mediated activation of anti-inflammatory target genes. To establish whether PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> activation could promote the growth of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> in our zebrafish model we treated infected larvae with the drug troglitazone - a specific PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> agonist &#x2013; at a concentration previously shown to activate PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> in zebrafish larvae. At this concentration we found that troglitazone was able to increase the growth of <italic>&#x0394;plb1-GFP</italic> and H99-GFP during infection. Although these findings strongly suggest that the cryptococcal growth promoting effects of 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> may mediated via activation of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>, further work will be needed to prove that the effects we observe when PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> is activated by troglitazone are due to the activity 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>In conclusion we have shown for the first time that synthesis of eicosanoids by <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is able to promote intracellular growth within macrophages and within an <italic>in vivo</italic> host. Additionally, we have uncovered a new virulence factor &#x2013; 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; that is produced from PGE<sub>2</sub> during infection. We provide evidence for a possible mechanism for 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> via activation of PPAR-<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> which is known to promote anti-inflammatory immune pathways. Finally, we have provided a potential new therapeutic pathway for treatment of cryptococcal infection as several eicosanoid modulating drugs are approved for patient treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>

<p>Washed and counted <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells were pelleted at 3300g for 1 minute and re-suspended in 10&#x0025; Polyvinylpyrrolidinone (PVP), 0.5&#x0025; Phenol Red in PBS to give the required inoculum in 1 nl. This injection fluid was loaded into glass capillaries shaped with a needle puller for microinjection. Zebrafish larvae were injected at 2-days post fertilisation; the embryos were anesthetised by immersion in 0.168 mg/ml tricaine in E3 before being transferred onto microscope slides coated with 3&#x0025; methyl cellulose in E3 for injection. Prepared larvae were injected with two 0.5 nl boluses of injection fluid by compressed air into the yolk sac circulation valley. Following injection, larvae were removed from the glass slide and transferred to E3 to recover from anaesthetic and then transferred to fresh E3 to remove residual methyl cellulose. Successfully infected larvae (displaying systemic infection throughout the body and no visible signs of damage resulting from injection) were sorted using a fluorescent stereomicroscope. Infected larvae were maintained at 28 <sup>o</sup>C.</p>

<title>Eicosanoid / receptor agonist treatment of infected zebrafish larvae</title>
<p>All compounds below were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Compounds were resuspended in DMSO and stored at &#x2212;20 <sup>o</sup>C until used. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (CAY14010, 10mg/ml stock), Prostaglandin D2 (CAY12010, 10mg/ml stock), 16,16-dimethyl PGE<sub>2</sub> (CAY14750, 10mg/ml stock), 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> (CAY14720, 10mg/ml stock) and troglitazone (CAY14720, 10mg/ml stock).</p>
<p>Treatment with exogenous compounds during larval infected was performed by adding compounds (or equivalent solvent) to fish water (E3) to achieve the desired concentration. Fish were immersed in compound supplemented E3 throughout the experiment from the time of injection.</p>

<title>Zebrafish fungal burden measurement</title>
<p>Individual infected zebrafish embryos were placed into single wells of a 96 well plate (VWR) with 200 ul or E3 (unsupplemented E3, or E3 supplemented with eicosanoids / receptor agonist depending on the assay). Infected embryos were imaged at 0 days post infection (dpi), 1 dpi, 2 dpi and 3 dpi in their 96 well plates using a Nikon Ti-E with a CFI Plan Achromat UW 2&#x00D7; N.A 0.06 objective lens. Images were captured with a Neo sCMOS (Andor, Belfast, UK) and NIS Elements (Nikon, Richmond, UK). Images were exported from NIS Elements into Image J FIJI as monochrome tif files. Images were threshholded in FIJI using the &#x2018;moments&#x2019; threshold preset and converted to binary images to remove all pixels in the image that did not correspond to the intensity of the fluorescently tagged <italic>C. neoformans.</italic> The outline of the embryo was traced using the &#x2018;polygon&#x2019; ROI tool, avoiding autofluorescence from the yolk sac. The total number of pixels in the threshholded image were counted using the FIJI &#x2018;analyse particles&#x2019; function, the &#x2018;total area&#x2019; measurement from the &#x2018;summary&#x2019; readout was used for the total number of GFP &#x002B; pixels in each embryo.</p>
