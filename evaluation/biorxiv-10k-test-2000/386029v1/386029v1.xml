<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The malarial pathogen <italic>Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)</italic> is a member of the Apicomplexa, which independently evolved a highly specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from an ancestral malate dehydrogenase (MDH) via a five-residue insertion in a key active site loop. <italic>Pf</italic>LDH is widely considered an attractive drug target due to its unique active site. Apicomplexan loop conservation suggests that a particular insertion sequence was required to evolve LDH specificity, and we previously showed (Boucher 2014) that a tryptophan in the insertion, W107f, is essential for activity and specificity. However, the roles of other residues in the loop are currently unknown. Here we show that <italic>Pf</italic>LDH activity is remarkably resilient to radical perturbations of both loop identity and length. Thus, alternative insertions could have evolved LDH specificity as long as they contained a tryptophan in the proper location. <italic>Pf</italic>LDH therefore has high potential to develop resistance to drugs that target its distinctive active site.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apicomplexa are obligate, intracellular eukaryotic parasites of animals responsible for many human diseases, including malaria, cryptosporidiosis, babesiosis, cystoisosporiasis, cyclosporiasis, and toxoplasmosis. The organisms responsible for malaria are of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> responsible for the most lethal form of malaria. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proceeds through a complex life-cycle in two different hosts. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites infect humans <italic>via</italic> a mosquito bite. These sporozoites invade liver cells, where they multiply asexually into merozoites. The merozoites rupture the liver cells and enter the bloodstream, where they invade erythrocytes and replicate. The replication of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in erythrocytes is known as the blood stage of infection, which is largely responsible for the clinical symptoms of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>During the blood stage, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> must respire anaerobically to regenerate NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], an essential electron acceptor in glycolysis. In the presence of oxygen, ATP production is maximized by metabolizing glucose to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O <italic>via</italic> glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain, which regenerates NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> for use in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> must be regenerated through pyruvate fermentation to prevent a stall in glycolysis and to generate sufficient amounts of ATP for cellular function. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) couples the regeneration of NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> from NADH to the reduction of pyruvate to lactate. Since the blood stage of malarial infection occurs under anaerobic conditions, the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> LDH (<italic>Pf</italic>LDH) is essential for the pathogen&#x2019;s survival as the only means to regenerate NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Apicomplexan LDHs evolved from an ancestral &#x03B1;-proteobacterial malate dehydrogenase (MDH), independently of canonical LDHs such as those found in the metazoan hosts of apicomplexan parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Despite convergent evolutionary origins, <italic>Pf</italic>LDH and canonical LDHs both share a similar catalytic mechanism. The enzymatic reduction of pyruvate to lactate proceeds via the following steps: (1) starting in the &#x201C;loop-open&#x201D; conformation, NADH binds the <italic>apo</italic> enzyme, (2) R171 orients pyruvate in the active site to form the ternary complex, (3) the substrate specificity loop closes over the active site, allowing R109 to bind the substrate and stabilize the transition state, (4) NADH reduces pyruvate to lactate by hydride transfer, (5) the substrate specificity loop opens to release lactate, and (6) NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is released to regenerate the <italic>apo</italic> enzyme. D168 activates the catalytic H195, allowing for a proton transfer during the reduction of pyruvate to lactate (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). Movement of the substrate specificity loop is the rate-limiting step in catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>

<graphic xlink:href="386029_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The LDH substrate specificity loop also plays an important role in substrate recognition. This loop contains a residue at position 102, commonly referred to as the &#x201C;specificity residue&#x201D;, which distinguishes among the R-groups of different 2-ketoacid substrates. In all known MDHs, the specificity residue is an arginine, which forms a salt bridge with the methylene carboxylate group of malate and oxaloacetate (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). In canonical LDHs the specificity residue is a glutamine, which contacts and recognizes the lactate and pyruvate methyl group (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>However, the convergent apicomplexan LDHs did not evolve by a mutation at position 102. Rather, apicomplexan LDHs evolved from an ancestral MDH via a unique five amino acid insertion in the substrate specificity loop that switches substrate specificity from malate/oxaloacetate to lactate/pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The insertion lengthens the loop, but otherwise the structures of <italic>Pf</italic>LDH and canonical LDHs and MDHs are highly similar (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="386029_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Crystal structures of canonical LDHs with the substrate specificity loop in the closed conformation show the Q102 specificity residue contacting substrate analogs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). In contrast, the <italic>Pf</italic>LDH crystal structure shows W107f contacting a substrate analog in the closed conformation, suggesting that W107f is the apicomplexan LDH &#x201C;specificity residue&#x201D; rather than the lysine at position 102 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). Using point mutations and alanine scanning of the substrate specificity loop, we previously showed that W107f is essential for <italic>Pf</italic>LDH enzyme activity and substrate recognition, while mutations of K102 have negligible effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Pf</italic>LDH is widely considered an attractive therapeutic target due to its essential role during pathogen replication in the blood stage and due to its distinct active site architecture, which provides an opportunity to selectively inhibit the parasite enzyme versus the host LDH. Development of small molecule inhibitors against <italic>Pf</italic>LDH is currently an active area of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], and selective antibody inhibitors have been developed that target the unique <italic>Pf</italic>LDH substrate specificity loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Sequence comparison of apicomplexan LDHs suggests the specificity loop region is highly conserved (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Hence, selective inhibitors of <italic>Pf</italic>LDH are also likely to be effective against various <italic>Plasmodium</italic> strains and other apicomplexan LDHs (for example, as with <italic>Babesia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]).</p>

</fig>
<p>The apparent sequence conservation of the substrate specificity loop poses an evolutionary problem: Was the conserved insertion sequence necessary for evolution of LDH specificity from the ancestral MDH? Furthermore, crystal structures show that much of the apicomplexan LDH loop bulges out into solution, lacking any clear structural role without contacting the rest of the protein. Was the entire five-residue insertion necessary, or could a shorter insertion have sufficed? To answer these questions, we probed the functional constraints on residue identity and loop length within the <italic>Pf</italic>LDH substrate specificity loop by perturbation analysis. Loop conservation was quantified by estimating the evolutionary substitution rates across the loop, which identified several slow-evolving positions likely to be functionally constrained. With this information we generated an ensemble of <italic>Pf</italic>LDH loop mutants and characterized their steady-state kinetics. We also made a series of mutants with varying loop lengths to characterize the functional dependence on loop length. Surprisingly, neither sequence identity nor loop length are under strong functional constraint, as long as W107f is unperturbed.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Site-Directed Mutagenesis</title>
<p>The <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene (gi#: 124513226) was synthesized and subcloned into pET-11b by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) with a C-terminal 6xHis-Tag. All mutations and truncations were generated using a QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with primers synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). All sequences were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing at Genewiz (Cambridge, Massachusetts). Conventional LDH numbering is based on the canonical dogfish LDH sequence, which has no insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The residues in the apicomplexan insertion are thus numbered using the residue that precedes the insertion, K107, with letters appended to each residue sequentially: G106, K107a, S107b, D107c, K107d, E107e, W107f, and N108.</p>

<title>Protein Expression</title>
<p>Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Cells were grown at 37 &#x00B0;C and 225 RPM agitation in 2xYT media supplemented with 30mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8 and 0.1&#x0025; (w/v) glucose with cell growth monitored at OD<sub>600</sub>. When cultures reached OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5-0.8, cells were induced with 0.5mM IPTG and incubated for four hours at 37 &#x00B0;C and 225 RPM agitation. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Purification</title>
<p>Cell pellets were resuspended on ice in 25mL of 50mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300mM sodium chloride, 10mM imidazole buffer and 375 units of Pierce universal nuclease (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) per 1.5L of culture pellet. Resuspended cells were sonicated on ice for 2 minutes at 35&#x0025; amplitude (30 seconds ON, 20 seconds OFF). Cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 25,000xg to separate soluble and insoluble fractions. Supernatant was 0.22uM syringe filtered. The filtered lysate was purified by affinity chromatography with a 5mL HisTrap FF nickel column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Protein was eluted and fractionated with a 10mM to 500mM imidazole gradient. Fractions were inspected for protein content by SDS-PAGE, then pooled and concentrated in Amicon Ultracel-10K centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Concentrated protein was buffer exchanged into 50mM tris, pH 7.4, 100mM sodium chloride, 0.1mM EDTA and 0.01&#x0025; (w/v) azide <italic>via</italic> a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The final enzyme concentrations were calculated by absorbance spectroscopy using Beer&#x2019;s law with 280nm extinction coefficients and molecular weights given by ExPASy&#x2019;s ProtParam program.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Kinetic Assays</title>
<p>All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Initial rates for the conversion of pyruvate to lactate were monitored on a CARY 100 Bio spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) by following the decrease in absorbance at 340nm associated with the conversion of NADH to NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. Kinetics assays were performed with variable pyruvate concentrations and constant NADH (200uM) in a 50mM tris, pH 7.5, 50mM potassium chloride buffer at 25 &#x00B0;C. The enzyme concentration ranged between 1uM and 1nM. Initial rates were plotted against substrate concentration and fit using KaleidaGraph to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v/[E]<sub>t</sub> &#x003D; k<sub>cat</sub>[S]/(K<sub>M</sub> &#x002B; [S]) or a substrate inhibition equation (v/[E]t &#x003D; k<sub>cat</sub> [S]/(K<sub>M</sub> &#x002B; [S] &#x002B; [S]<sup>2</sup>/K<sub>i</sub>)). All assays were performed in triplicate, and errors reported as standard error of the mean (SEM, e.g. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplemental Tables 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">5</xref>).</p>

<title>Protein Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination</title>
<p>All reagents were used from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Conditions were optimized based on promising conditions identified from screens with Crystal ScreenTM and Crystal Screen 2TM (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). 4uL drops (2uL of 600uM or 20mg/mL protein stock and 2uL of well solution) were spotted on cover slips (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and equilibrated against 1mL of well solution by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Crystals were cryo-protected by soaking in 15&#x0025; (w/v) dextrose solution for 3 minutes, transferring to a 30&#x0025; (w/v) dextrose solution, and then immediately flash freezing the crystal in liquid N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Data sets were collected at the SIBYLS Beamline (12.3.1 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA) and indexed, integrated, and scaled with XDS/XSCALE. PHENIX&#x2019;s AutoMR program was used to solve the structures by molecular replacement with a previously solved <italic>Pf</italic>LDH model (PDB: 1T2D). Models were improved by rounds of manual refinement in Coot and automated refinement with PHENIX&#x2019;s phenix.refine program. Model quality was determined using MolProbity in PHENIX. All structural alignments and images were generated using PyMOL.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Evolutionary Conservation Estimation</title>
<p>Apicomplexan LDH sequences were collected from the NCBI database using the BLASTP searches with four query sequences, UniProt IDs: MDHC_PIG, Q76NM3_PLAF7, C6KT25_PLAF, and MDH_WOLPM for full coverage of the superfamily. Non-LDH Sequences were removed along with sequences shorter than 290 or longer than 340. The final dataset contained 277 sequences. A multiple sequence alignment of the dataset was generated using Muscle and analyzed using PhyML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and ConSurf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The relative conservation of each amino acid position within the alignment was estimated by quantifying the relative substitution rate using Empirical Bayes maximum likelihood methods.</p>

<title>Contributions from Individual Specificity Loop Residues</title>
<p>We previously used alanine scanning mutagenesis to assess the functional contribution of individual residues within the specificity loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The boundaries of the scan were determined from a superposition of the human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and <italic>Pf</italic>LDH (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). The main chains of the specificity loops in the two structures conformationally diverge between positions 101 and 108, a span of twelve residues. These twelve residues were individually mutated to alanine in <italic>Pf</italic>LDH and characterized kinetically to evaluate the effects of each substitution on catalysis.</p>
<p>The alanine scan surprisingly revealed that all residues except W107fA tolerate mutation with little-to-no effect on their catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]). W107fA has a four order of magnitude drop in k<sub>cat</sub>, indicating that W107f is essential for wild-type levels of strong catalysis. Notably, k<sub>cat</sub> remains relatively unaffected in all the other mutants (within a factor of two of the wild-type value). W107fA also has an increased K<sub>M</sub>, fifty times greater than wild-type. The remaining alanine mutants all have K<sub>M</sub> values within an order of magnitude relative to wild-type <italic>Pf</italic>LDH (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>).</p>

The W107fA structure is nearly identical to the wild-type protein (RMSD of 0.95 &#x00C5;2, <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>). The only significant difference between W107A and wild-type is in the orientation of the specificity loop. The wild-type loop is in the closed conformation, indicated by a kinked helix running along the back of the protein (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref></bold>).

<title>Conservative W107f mutations</title>
<p>As mutating a tryptophan to an alanine is a dramatic mutation, we wished to investigate the tolerance of position 107f to more conservative changes.

<p>All W107f mutants had reduced enzymatic activity, with k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values for pyruvate ranging from fifty times lower to five orders of magnitude below that of wild-type.

<p>While these aromatic mutations have a substantial effect, the resulting activities are likely physiologically relevant as they are similar to those of other wild-type LDHs in the apicomplexan phylum, which have k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values ranging from 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The other W107f mutants have more diminished activities. The smaller histidine, while still an aromatic residue, cripples the enzyme a further fifty times below W107fF. The non-planar hydrophobic amino acid mutants are all four orders of magnitude or more below the wild-type pyruvate k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>, nearly on par with W107fA. Glutamine at position 107f is equally detrimental to pyruvate activity as the non-planar hydrophobics, despite being the specificity residue in canonical LDHs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref></bold>). The substitutions have substantial effects on both the k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> except for W107fY and W107fF, both of which have a k<sub>cat</sub> within half of wild-type, and W107fH, which has a K<sub>M</sub> nearly equal to wild-type (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Conservation of Loop Identity</title>
<p>Our alanine-scan mutants indicate most specificity loop residues are functionally unconstrained. This raises the question as to why the loop sequence is apparently well-conserved. High sequence conservation can arise for two main reasons, either (1) functional constraint to preserve the sequence or (2) insufficient time for the sequences to diverge. Phylogenetic rate analysis can control for evolutionary relatedness. Low rates indicate functional importance due to purifying selection for sequences identity, high rates suggest low functional constraint. Our rate analysis indicates K102, K107a, and E107e within the loop are relatively slow-evolving and likely functionally important (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We designed two <italic>Pf</italic>LDH mutant backgrounds to determine the role of the conserved residues. &#x201C;Poly-A&#x201D; and &#x201C;Poly-S&#x201D; mutants were constructed with all positions 101-107e mutated to alanine and serine, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref></bold>). The alanine scan indicates that any position other than W107f can be mutated individually with minimal effect on activity. Mutations in combination may have a more significant effect, and the Poly-A and Poly-S constructs test this by mutating each position simultaneously. The more polar Poly-S should provide a less drastic sequence change for a solvent-exposed surface loop and may indicate if changes in Poly-A function are due to the increased hydrophobicity. W107f was left unchanged in both mutant backgrounds because the alanine scan and the W107f substitution data show that the identity of position 107f is highly constrained. Remarkably, both the Poly-A and Poly-S mutants retain LDH activity within approximately two orders of magnitude of wild-type <italic>Pf</italic>LDH (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>), a level of activity observed in other apicomplexan LDHs such as the <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> LDHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<p>We designed two additional mutants within the Poly-A background to determine the contributions from slow-evolving positions. If the loop residues are conserved due to functional constraint, there should be a partial rescue of activity when adding them back into the Poly-A mutant. The first construct &#x201C;Cons&#x201D; contains <italic>Pf</italic>LDH wild-type residues at any loop position evolving slowly (defined as relative rate &#x003C;1): T101, K102, P104, K107a, S107b, D107c, and E107e (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref></bold>). Adding back the conserved residues partially restored activity by a factor of ten increase in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> compared to Poly-A (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>)</bold> but is still ten-fold less than wild-type <italic>Pf</italic>LDH activity.

<title>Tolerance of the Specificity Loop to Truncation</title>
<p>The five-residue loop insertion is unique to the apicomplexan LDHs, which makes their specificity loop longer than what is seen in canonical LDHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The existence of highly active canonical LDHs with shorter specificity loops raises the question of whether the large <italic>Pf</italic>LDH loop is functionally necessary. Can <italic>Pf</italic>LDH retain activity with a shortened specificity loop? We therefore designed and tested a series of loop deletion mutants, ranging from one to five residues, to assess the dependence of <italic>Pf</italic>LDH activity on loop length (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>)</bold>. Loop deletion mutants are named in the form of M(X) where X is the single letter amino acid code for the missing residues. Additionally, the &#x201C;GSA-Linker&#x201D; construct incorporates a generic glycine-serine-alanine motif that connects T101 to W107f, making the shortest loop possible that retains W107f (based on the distance between the backbone C&#x03B1;s of T101 and W107f). GSA-Linker is effectively a 6-residue deletion.</p>

<title>W107f is Under Extreme Functional Constraint</title>
<p>Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the specificity loop revealed that only W107f contributes significantly to LDH activity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). Additionally, most of the alternative residues at the 107f position fail to replicate wild-type levels of activity. Only the other large aromatic residues, tyrosine and phenylalanine retain physiologically relevant activity, though still below wild-type <italic>Pf</italic>LDH. (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). These results show that only by mutating a large planar aromatic residue at the 107f position could have conferred LDH activity to the apicomplexan ancestral MDH, but without needing to be tryptophan.</p>
<p>Unlike the wild-type, the crystal structure of W107fA is in the open conformation, suggesting W107f contributes favorable interactions necessary for loop closure as the W107fA mutant apparently prefers the open state (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>). The rate-limiting step in pyruvate turn-over by <italic>Pf</italic>LDH is loop closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], and the reduction in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for W107fA results primarily from a decrease in k<sub>cat</sub>. Taken together, these facts suggest that k<sub>cat</sub> of the W107fA mutant decreased because loop closure is slower. Given that K<sub>M</sub> &#x003D; (k<sub>off</sub>&#x002B;k<sub>cat</sub>)/k<sub>on</sub>, and the difference in mutant and wild-type K<sub>M</sub> is much smaller than the k<sub>cat</sub> effect, there must be some compensatory change in the binding constants of the substrate: either k<sub>off</sub> increased or k<sub>on</sub> decreased. We propose that loss of favorable interactions from W107f result in a loop that prefers to remain open in a conformation unfavorable for substrate binding, and thus substrate is ejected before hydride transfer takes place.</p>

<title>Conservation and Function Contribution of Specificity Loop Residues</title>
<p>Six of the ten loop residues evolve slower than average and thus may be functionally important (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref></bold>). The contribution of the three slowest evolving (K102, K107a, and E107e) is however modest, a 10-fold increase in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> compared to a loop consisting entirely of alanines and W107f (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>). Activity is not further rescued by incorporating additional slow-evolving wild-type residues.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Pf</italic>LDH is roughly 50&#x0025; sequence identical to LDHs from closely related Apicomplexa, such as <italic>Eimeria maxima</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], yet the specificity loop region appears well-conserved. However, we find no obvious reason that the sequence and length of the specificity loop should be conserved, and in fact quantitive rate analysis indicates that most of the loop is not particularly slowly evolving. While the most conserved residues appear to contribute minimally to LDH function, it is possible the loop is important for another, unknown function. The loop sequence identity could be pleiotropically constrained if the enzyme is &#x201C;moonlighting&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and performs multiple functions for the organism (as seen in some vertebrate LDHs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]).</p>

<title>The Specificity Loop can be Dramatically Truncated</title>
<p>The <italic>Pf</italic>LDH specificity loop can be truncated by as many as four residues and still maintain significant levels of activity (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref></bold>). K<sub>M</sub> is affected by loop truncations more than k<sub>cat</sub>, with all truncation mutants exhibiting a K<sub>M</sub> an order of magnitude greater than wild-type, suggesting impaired substrate binding. Assuming k<sub>on</sub> is diffusion limited and is unlikely to be affected, the loop truncations effects are probably mediated by an increase in substrate k<sub>off</sub> due to a moderately unfavorable truncated loop conformation.</p>
<p>Loop deletion mutants may expose the active site to bulk solvent and increase the frequency of nonproductive binding events, which may explain why each of the three-residue deletion mutants all have approximately equal k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> regardless of the location in the specificity loop or the identity of the residues removed. The size of substrate loop is more important than loop identity during catalysis. However, there is a lower limit to how short the loop can be to remain functional.</p>

<title>Evolutionary Requisites and Implications for Drug Resistance</title>
<p>Our results show that <italic>Pf</italic>LDH activity is extremely robust to mutations in the specificity loop that alter either its sequence identity or length. In fact, only W107f appears to be particularly important for enzyme function, and yet other aromatic residues can function nearly as well tryptophan. Ten of eleven possible positions are mutated in the Poly-A and Poly-S constructs and both are functional enzymes with physiologically relevant activity. Deletions of one, two, and three amino acids throughout the loop result in functional enzymes. These results suggest that the exact insertion sequence and length was unnecessary to evolve a novel LDH from the ancestral MDH. Many possible loop insertions could have evolved a functional LDH, regardless of sequence identity or length, with the only necessity being an aromatic amino acid properly positioned in the active site.</p>
<p>Drug resistance can develop if the protein target is not functionally constrained. There are many possible specificity loops that can produce physiologically relevant LDH activities in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. <italic>Pf</italic>LDH thus has high potential to evolve mutations that could abolish any inhibitory effect of a drug that targets the active site loop because of the lack of significant functional constraint. The specificity loop region is conserved in the phylum and thus targeting the specificity loop in other Apicomplexa would likely be met with the same difficulties.</p>
