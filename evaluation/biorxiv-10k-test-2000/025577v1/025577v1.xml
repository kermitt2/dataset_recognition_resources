<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We previously proposed a simple regression-based method to map quantitative trait loci underlying function-valued phenotypes. In order to better handle the case of noisy phenotype measurements and accommodate the correlation structure among time points, we propose an alternative approach that maintains much of the simplicity and speed of the regression-based method. We overcome noisy measurements by replacing the observed data with a smooth approximation. We then apply functional principal component analysis, replacing the smoothed phenotype data with a small number of principal components. Quantitative trait locus mapping is applied to these dimension-reduced data, either with a multi-trait method or by considering the traits individually and then taking the average or maximum LOD score across traits. We apply these approaches to root gravitropism data on Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines and further investigate their performance in computer simulations. Our methods have been implemented in the R package, funqtl.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Technology developments have enabled the automated acquisition of numerous phenotypes, included function-valued traits, such as phenotypes measured over time. High-dimensional phenotype data are increasingly considered as part of efforts to map the genetic loci (quantitative trait loci, QTL) that influence quantitative traits.</p>
<p>Numerous methods are available for QTL mapping with function-valued traits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ma <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> considered parametric models such as the logistic growth model, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> The high-dimensional phenotype is reduced to a few parameters. This works well if the parametric model is approximately correct but in many cases the correction functional form is not clear. Yang et <italic>al.</italic> (2009) proposed a non-parametric functional QTL mapping method, with a selected number of basis functions to fit the function-valued phenotype. Min et <italic>al.</italic> (2011) extended this method to multiple-QTL models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sillanpaa <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> proposed another Bayesian multiple-QTL mapping method based on hierarchical modeling. Xiong et <italic>al.</italic> (2011) proposed an additional non-parametric functional mapping method based on estimating equations. An important barrier to these methods is the long computation time required for the analysis.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, we proposed two simple regression-based methods to map quantitative trait loci underlying function-valued phenotypes, based on the results from the individual analysis of the phenotypes at each time point. With the SLOD score, we take the average of the LOD scores across time points, and with the MLOD score, we take the maximum. These approaches are fast to compute, work well when the trait data are smooth, and provide results that are easily interpreted. Another important advantage is the ability to consider multiple QTL, which can improve power and enable the separation of linked QTL. However, the approaches do not work as well when the trait data are not smooth, and they do not take account of the correlation among time points.</p>
<p>In the present paper, we describe methods to overcome these weaknesses. First, we replace the observed trait data with a smooth approximation. Second, we apply functional principal component analysis (PCA) as a dimension-reduction technique, and replace the smoothed phenotype data with a small number of principal components.</p>
<p>QTL analysis is then performed on these dimension-reduced data. We consider either the multivariate QTL mapping method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Knott and Haley (2000)</xref>, or use the SLOD or MLOD scores, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. These methods all have analogs for multiple-QTL models, by extending the penalized LOD scores of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Broman and Speed (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Manichaikul <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>We illustrate these methods by application to the root gravitropism data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>, measured by automated image analysis over a time course of 8 hr across a population of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> recombinant inbred lines (RIL). We further investigate the performance of these approaches in computer simulations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We will focus on the case of recombinant inbred lines, with genotypes AA or BB. Consider <italic>n</italic> lines, with function-valued phenotypes measured at <italic>T</italic> discrete time points (<italic>t<sub>1</sub></italic>, &#x2026;, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Smoothing</title>
<p>We first smooth the phenotype data for each individual. Let <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) denote the observed phenotype for individual <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. We assume underlying smooth curves <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), with <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) &#x003D; <italic>X</italic><sub>i</sub> (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) &#x002B; <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>We approximate the functional form of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t)</italic> as <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t)</italic> <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> for a set of basis functions <italic>&#x03D5;</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), &#x2026;, <italic>&#x03D5;</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), where the number of basis functions, <italic>K</italic>, is generally much smaller than the number of time points, <italic>T</italic>. There are many possible choices of basis functions. We are using B-splines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ramsay and Silverman 2005</xref>, pp. 49&#x2013;53).</p>
<p>Define the <italic>K</italic> by <italic>T</italic> matrix &#x03A6;, with &#x03A6;<sub><italic>kj</italic></sub> &#x003D; &#x03A6;<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>), for <italic>k</italic> &#x003D; 1,<italic>&#x2026;,K</italic> and <italic>j</italic> &#x003D; 1,&#x2026;, <italic>T</italic>. We estimate the coefficients, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>ik</italic></sub> by minimizing the least squares criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ramsay and Silverman 2005</xref>):
<disp-formula id="ueqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="025577_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>This gives the solution &#x0109;&#x003D;(&#x03A6;&#x0027;&#x03A6;)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x03A6;&#x0027;y We then obtain the smoothed phenotypes <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> which are used in all subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>A key issue is the choice of the number of basis functions. We use 10-fold cross-validation and choose the number of basis functions that minimizes the estimated sum of squared errors.</p>

<title>Functional principal component analysis</title>
<p>Having replaced the phenotype data with a smooth approximation, <italic>&#x0177;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), we use functional principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ramsay and Silverman 2005</xref>) to reduce the dimensionality with little loss of information.</p>
<p>In functional PCA, we seek a sequence of orthonormal functions, <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), that take the role of principal components but for functional data. By orthonormal, we mean &#x3008;<italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), &#x3008;<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x3009; &#x003D; &#x222B;&#x03A8;<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)&#x3008;<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>dt</italic> &#x003D; 0, for all <italic>j</italic> &#x2260; k, and &#x2016;&#x03A8;<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>)&#x2016;<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; &#x3008;<italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), &#x3008;<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x3009;&#x003D; 1 for all <italic>j.</italic></p>
<p>With our smoothed functional data, <italic>&#x0177;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), we first find the function <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) that maximizes <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> subject to the constraint &#x2016; <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>)&#x2016; &#x003D; 1. The computations make use of the B-spline basis representation of the <italic>&#x0177;</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>).</p>
<p>Conceptually, the procedure then proceeds inductively. Having identified <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub>1</sub>,&#x2026;, <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, we choose <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub><italic>j</italic>&#x002B;1</sub> that maximizes <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> subject to the constraint that <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub>1</sub>,&#x2026;, <italic>&#x03A8;</italic><sub><italic>j</italic>&#x002B;1</sub> are orthonormal.</p>
<p>We focus on a small number, <italic>p</italic>, of functional PCs that explain 99&#x0025; of the data variation and consider the coefficients <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, as derived traits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Single-QTL analysis</title>
<p>Having smoothed and dimension-reduced the phenotype data, we then use the <italic>p</italic> principal components as derived traits for QTL analysis, using one of three methods. First, we apply the multivariate QTL mapping method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Knott and Haley (2000)</xref>. Our second and third approaches are to analyze the <italic>p</italic> derived traits individually and take the average or maximum LOD score, respectively, at each putative QTL position, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>HKLOD score</title>
<p>In the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Knott and Haley (2000)</xref>, we take <italic>n</italic> &#x00D7; <italic>p</italic> matrix of derived phenotypes and scan the genome, and at each position, <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>, we fit a multivariate regression model with a single QTL. The basic model is <italic>Y &#x003D; XB</italic> &#x002B; <italic>E</italic>, where <italic>Y</italic> is the <italic>n</italic> &#x00D7; <italic>p</italic> matrix of phenotypes, <italic>X</italic> is an <italic>n</italic> &#x00D7; 2 matrix of QTL genotype probabilities, and <italic>B</italic> is a 2 &#x00D7; <italic>p</italic> matrix of QTL effects. The rows of the <italic>n</italic> &#x00D7; <italic>p</italic> matrix of errors, <italic>E</italic>, are assumed to be independent and identically distributed draws from a multivariate normal distribution.</p>
<p>The maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficients is <italic>B &#x003D; (X&#x2032;X)</italic><sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<italic>X &#x2032; Y</italic>, the same as if the traits were analyzed separately. A key component of the likelihood is the matrix of sums of squares and cross-products of residuals, RSS &#x003D; (<italic>Y &#x2014; XB)/(Y &#x2014; XB)</italic>, and particularly its determinant, &#x007C;RSS&#x007C;. The log<sub>10</sub> likelihood ratio comparing the model with a single QTL at position <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>, to the null model of no QTL, is
<disp-formula id="ueqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="025577_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where &#x007C;RSS<sub>0</sub>&#x007C; is for the null model with no QTL and &#x007C;RSS(<italic>&#x03BB;</italic>) is for the model with a single QTL at <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2c2">
<title>SL and ML scores</title>
<p>As further approaches, we apply the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> to the <italic>p</italic> derived traits. We perform a genome scan by Haley-Knott regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Haley and Knott 1992</xref>) with each trait separately, giving the <italic>LODj (</italic>&#x03BB;<italic>)</italic> for trait <italic>j</italic> at position <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>.</p>
<p>Our second criterion, is to take the average LOD score, across traits:</p>
<p>SL <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. We call this the SL score, to distinguish it from SLOD of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, calculated using the original phenotype data.</p>
<p>Our third criterion is to take the maximum LOD score, ML(<italic>&#x03BB;</italic>) &#x003D; max<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> LOD<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> (<italic>&#x03BB;</italic>). We call this the ML score, to distinguish it from the MLOD score of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Multiple-QTL analysis</title>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, we use the penalized LOD score criterion on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Broman and Speed (2002)</xref> to extend each of the LOD-type statistics defined above, for use with multiple-QTL models. The penalized LOD score is pLOD(<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>) &#x003D; LOD(<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>) &#x2014; T&#x007C;<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>&#x007C;, where <italic>&#x03B3;</italic> denotes a multiple-QTL model with strictly additive QTL, and &#x007C;<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>&#x007C; is the number of QTL in the model <italic>&#x03B3;</italic>. <italic>T</italic> is a penalty on model size, chosen as the 1 &#x2014; &#x03B1; quantile of the genome-wide maximum LOD score under the null hypothesis of no QTL, derived from a permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Churchill and Doerge 1994</xref>). We may replace the LOD score in the above equation with any of the HKLOD, SL and ML scores.</p>
<p>To search the space of models, we use the stepwise model search algorithm of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Broman and Speed (2002)</xref>: we use forward selection up to a model of fixed size (e.g., 10 QTL), followed by backward elimination to the null model. The selected model <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is that which maximizes the penalized LOD score criterion, among all models visited.</p>
<p>The selected model is of the form <italic>Z</italic> &#x003D; <italic>Q&#x03B2;</italic> &#x002B; <italic>&#x03B5;</italic>, where <italic>Z</italic> contains the derived traits (the coefficients from the functional principal component analysis) and <italic>Q</italic> contains an intercept column and genotype probabilities at the inferred QTL. The derived phenotypes, <italic>Z</italic>, are linearly related to the smoothed phenotypes, <italic>&#x0176;</italic>, by the equation <italic>&#x0176;</italic> &#x003D; <italic>Z</italic>&#x03C8;, where &#x03C8; is a matrix with (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>)th element &#x03C8;<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>). Thus we have <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline9.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and so <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline10.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> are the estimated QTL effects, translated back to the time domain (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, below).</p>

<title>Application</title>
<p>As an illustration of our approaches, we considered data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> on gravitropism in Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines (RIL), Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) &#x00D7; Landsberg erecta (Ler). For each of 162 RIL, 8&#x2212;20 replicate seeds per line were germinated and then rotated 90 degrees, to change the orientation of gravity. The growth of the seedlings was captured on video, over the course of eight hours, and a number of phenotypes were derived by automated image analysis.</p>
<p>We focus on the angle of the root tip, in degrees, over time (averaged across replicates within an RIL), and consider only the first of two replicate data sets examined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. There is genotype data at 234 markers on five chromosomes; the function-valued root tip angle trait was measured at 241 time points (every two minutes for eight hours).</p>
<p>The data are available at the QTL Archive, which is now part of the Mouse Phenome Database, as the <italic>Moore1b</italic> data set:</p>

<title>Single-QTL analysis</title>
<p>We first performed genome scans with a single-QTL model by the multiple methods: SLOD and MLOD from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, EE(Wald) and EE(Residual) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>, and the HKLOD, SL, and ML methods described above (and using four principal components). We used a permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Churchill and Doerge 1994</xref>) with 1000 permutation replicates to estimate 5&#x0025; significance thresholds, which are shown in Supporting Information, Table S1.</p>
<p>The results are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The SLOD method (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) gave similar results to the EE(Residual) method (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), with significant evidence for QTL on chromosomes 1, 4, and 5. The MLOD method (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) also showed evidence for a QTL on chromosome 3.

These curves, which visualize both the evidence and localization of each QTL in the context of a multiple-QTL model, are calculated following an approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref>: The position of each QTL was varied one at a time, and at each location for a given QTL, we derived a LOD-type score comparing the multiple-QTL model with the QTL under consideration at a particular position and the locations of all other QTL fixed, to the model with the given QTL omitted. For the SL (or ML) method, the profile is calculated for the four derived traits, individually, and then the SL (or ML) profiles are obtained by averaging (or maximizing) across traits. For the HKLOD method, the profiles are calculated using the multivariate LOD test statistic.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, we applied, to these same data, the analogous multiple-QTL modeling approach, with the penalized-SLOD and penalized-MLOD criteria (that is, using the original phenotype data, without the smoothing and dimension-reduction steps). The result (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) with the penalized-SLOD criterion was the same two-QTL model identified by ML (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), while the penalized-MLOD criterion gave a three-QTL model, with a QTL on chromosome 3, similar to that inferred by single-QTL analysis with MLOD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The estimated QTL effects, translated back to the time domain, are displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. The red curves are for the five-QTL model identified with the penalized-HKLOD and penalized-SL criteria. The blue dashed curves are for the two-QTL identified with the penalized-ML criterion. The estimated QTL effects in panels B&#x2212;F are for the difference between the Cvi allele and the Ler allele.</p>
<p>The effects of the QTL on chromosomes 1 and 4 are approximately the same, whether or not the chromosome 2, 3 and 5 QTL are included in the model. The chromosome 1 QTL has greatest effect at later time points, while the chromosome 4 QTL has greatest effect earlier and over a wider interval of time. For both QTL, the Cvi allele increases the root tip angle phenotype.</p>
<p>In summary, the HKLOD and SL methods gave similar results. For these data, the HKLOD and SL methods indicate evidence for a QTL on each chromosome. The results suggest that these approaches, with the initial dimension-reduction via functional PCA, may have higher power to detect QTL, as the multiple-QTL analysis with SLOD and MLOD, without dimension-reduction, indicated fewer QTL.</p>

<title>Simulations</title>
<p>In order to investigate the performance of our proposed approaches and compare them to existing methods, we performed computer simulation studies with both single-QTL models and models with multiple QTL. For the simulations with a single-QTL model, we compared the HKLOD, SL, and ML methods to the SLOD and MLOD methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> and the estimating equation approaches of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>. For the simulations with multiple QTL, we omitted the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>, as they have not yet been implemented for multiple QTL.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Single-QTL models</title>
<p>To compare approaches in the context of a single QTL, we considered the simulation setting described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Yap <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>, though exploring a range of QTL effects.</p>
<p>We simulated an intercross with sample sizes of 100, 200, or 400, and a single chromosome of length 100 cM, with 6 equally spaced markers and with a QTL at 32 cM. The associated phenotypes was sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with the mean curve following a logistic function, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="025577_inline11.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> The AA genotype had <italic>a</italic> &#x003D; 29, <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; 7, <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.7; the AB genotype had <italic>a</italic> &#x003D; 28.5, <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; 6.5, <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.73; and the BB genotype had <italic>a</italic> &#x003D; 27.5, <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; 5, <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.75. The shape of the growth curve with this parameter was shown in Figure S3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. The phenotype data were simulated at 10 time points.</p>
<p>The residual error was assumed to following multivariate normal distributions with a covariance structure <italic>c</italic>&#x03A3;. The constant c controls the overall error variance, and &#x03A3; was chosen to have one of three forms: (1) auto-regressive with &#x03C3;<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 3, p &#x003D; 0.6, (2) equicorrelated with &#x03C3;<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 3, p &#x003D; 0.5, or (3) an &#x201C;unstructured&#x201D; covariance matrix, as given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Yap <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> (also shown in Table S2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>)).</p>
<p>The parameter <italic>c</italic> was given a range of values, which define the percent phenotypic variance explained by the QTL (the heritability). The effect of the QTL varies with time; we took the mean heritability across time as an overall summary. For the auto-regressive and equicorrelated covariance structures, we used <italic>c</italic> &#x003D; 1,2,3,6; for the unstructured covariance matrix, we took <italic>c</italic> &#x003D; 0.5,1,2,3.</p>
<p>For each of 10,000 simulation replicates, we applied the previous SLOD and MLOD methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, the EE(Wald) and EE(Residual) methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>, and the HKLOD, SL, and ML methods proposed here. For all seven approaches, we fit a three-parameter QTL model (that is, allowing for dominance).</p>
<p>The estimated power to detect the QTL as a function of heritability due to the QTL, for <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 100,200,400 and for the three different covariance structures, is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. With the autocorrelated variance structure, all methods worked well, though HKLOD had noticeably lower power. With the equicorrelated variance structure, EE(Wald), SL and ML methods had higher power than the other four methods. The HKLOD method also worked reasonably well, but the EE(Residual), SLOD and MLOD methods had low power. In the unstructured variance setting, EE(Wald), MLOD, SL and ML methods worked better than the other four methods. EE(Residual) did not work well in this setting.</p>

<p>The precision of QTL mapping, measured by the root mean square error in the estimated QTL position, is displayed in Figure S1. Performance, in terms of precision, corresponds quite closely to the performance in terms of power: when power is high, the RMS error of the estimated QTL position is low, and vice versa.</p>
<p>A possible weakness of SLOD and MLOD approaches was that they do not make use of the function-valued form of the phenotypes. The methods may further suffer lower power in the case of noisy phenotypes. The methods proposed in this paper use smoothing to handle the measurement error. We repeated the same simulations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> with <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 200, adding independent, normally distributed errors (with standard deviation 1 or 2) at each time point.</p>
<p>The estimated power to detect the QTL as a function of heritability due to the QTL, for added noise with SD &#x003D; 0,1,2 and the three different covariance structures, is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The power of the SLOD and MLOD were greatly affected by the introduction of noise. However, the SL and ML methods, which used both smoothing and dimension-reduction, work well in the presence of noise. The EE(Wald) method performed well in this case, as well. The EE(Residual) method did not work well compared to the other six methods. Overall, the EE(Wald) method continued to perform best.</p>

<p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the average computation time for SLOD/MLOD, EE(Wald), EE(Residual), HKLOD and SL/ML methods. For the single-QTL simulations, the computation time for the SLOD/MLOD and HKLOD methods are similar, while the SL/ML methods are somewhat slower. This is because, in the simulation data set, the phenotype was measured at 10 time points. In the application, with 241 time points, the functional PCA based methods (HKLOD and SL/ML) are faster than the SLOD/MLOD methods. The EE(Wald) method requires considerably longer computation time; on the other hand, it provided the highest power to detect QTL.</p>

<title>Multiple-QTL models</title>
<p>To investigate the performance of the penalized-HKLOD, penalized-SL and penalized-ML criteria in the context of multiple QTL, we used the same setting as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. We simulated data from a three-QTL model modeled after that estimated, with the penalized-MLOD criterion, for the root tip angle data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> considered in the Application section.</p>
<p>We assumed that the mean curve for the root tip angle phenotype followed a cubic polynomial, y &#x003D; <italic>a</italic> &#x002B; <italic>bt</italic> &#x002B; <italic>ct</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x002B; <italic>dt</italic><sup>3</sup>, and assumed that the effect of each QTL also followed such a cubic polynomial. The four parameters for a given individual were drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with mean defined by the QTL genotypes and variance matrix estimated from the root tip angle data. Details on the parameter values used in the simulations appear in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>.</p>
<p>Normally distributed measurement error (with mean 0 and variance 1) was added to the phenotype at each time point for each individual. Phenotypes are taken at 241 equally spaced time points in the interval of 0 to 1. We considered two sample sizes: <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 162 (as in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> data) and twice that, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 324.</p>
<p>We performed 100 simulation replicates. For each replicate, we applied a stepwise model selection approach with each of the penalized-HKLOD, penalized-SL, penalized-ML, penalized-SLOD, and penalized-MLOD criteria. The simulation results are shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The penalized-SL and penalized-HKLOD criteria had higher power to detect all three QTL. In particular, the power to detect the QTL on chromosome 3 was greatly increased, in comparison to the penalized-SLOD and penalized-MLOD criteria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have described two techniques for improving the regression-based methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> for QTL mapping with function-valued phenotypes: smoothing and dimensional-reduction. Smoothing leads to better performance in the case of noisy phenotype measurements, and dimension-reduction improves power. The particular methods we used (smoothing via B-splines, and dimensional reduction via functional principal component analysis) are not the only possibilities, but they are natural choices widely used in functional data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ramsay and Silverman 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Following smoothing and dimensional-reduction, we applied QTL analysis to the small number of derived traits, either by analyzing the traits individually and then combining the log likelihoods, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, or by applying the multivariate QTL mapping method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Knott and Haley (2000)</xref>. The latter approach cannot be applied directly to the original phenotypes, due to the large number of time points at which the traits were measured, but it can work well with the dimension-reduced derived traits.</p>
<p>Key advantages of our proposed methods include speed of computation and the ability to consider multiple-QTL models. The EE(Wald) method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>, based on estimating equations, was seen to be most powerful for QTL detection in our simulation study, but it is orders of magnitude slower and has not yet been implemented for multiple-QTL models.</p>
<p>Many other methods have been developed for QTL mapping with function-valued traits. However, most focus on single-QTL models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ma <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Yap <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Bayesian methods for multiple-QTL mapping with function-valued traits have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Min <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sillanpaa <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), but these methods are computationally intensive, and software is not available.</p>
<p>In considering multiple-QTL models, we have focused on strictly additive QTL. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Manichaikul <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> extended the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Broman and Speed (2002)</xref> by considering pairwise interactions among QTL. Our approaches may be similarly extended to handle interactions.</p>
<p>The enormous recent growth in capabilities for high-throughput phenotyping, including images and time series, particularly in plants (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cabrera-Bosquet <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araus and Cairns 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), is accompanied by a growth in interest in the genetic analysis such phenotype data. Speed of computation will be particularly important in the analysis of such high-dimensional data, as will the joint consideration of multiple loci. The methods we have proposed can meet many of these challenges.</p>
<p>We implemented our methods as a package, funqtl, for the general statistical software R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">R Core Team 2015</xref>). Our package makes use of the fda package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ramsay <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) for smoothing and functional PCA. It is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ikwak2/funqtl">https://github.com/ikwak2/funqtl</ext-link>.</p>
