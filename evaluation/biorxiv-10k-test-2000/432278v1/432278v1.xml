<title>Abstract</title>
<sec><title>Aim</title>
<p>Although it is commonly proposed that nutrient cycling can impact plant community diversity, this relationship has not been fully examined in arid and semi-arid zones. Here, we expand on the framework for evaluating the relationship between biodiversity and ecological stoichiometry by scaling up from the level of the community.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Location</title>
<p>The upper reaches of the Tarim River (Northwest China, 80&#x00B0;10&#x2019;-84&#x00B0;36&#x2019;E, 0&#x00B0;25&#x2019;-41&#x00B0;10&#x2019;N).</p></sec>
<sec><title>Methods</title>
<p>We used multivariate analysis of variance to compare the stoichiometric characteristics and species diversity indices of sampled plant communities. We also measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) content of plants. We then assessed correlations between community stoichiometry and species diversity through structural equation models (SEM) and redundancy analysis (RDA).</p></sec>
<sec><title>Results</title>
<p>We found that the differences between stoichiometric characteristics and community diversity indices were highly significant. The Margalef index was strongly related to C and P content. The Simpson&#x2019;s index and Shannon-Weaner index were most strongly correlated with C content. Pielou&#x2019;s index was closely related to C and N contents, and the C:N and C:P ratios were important at driving ecological dominance.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Main Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study highlights the importance of ecological stoichiometry in driving community assembly and diversity within a desert ecosystems in northwestern China. The relationship between eclogical stoichiometry in the desert plant community had an effect on species diversity, and it was a good indicator of plant community diversity.</p></sec>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Ecological stoichiometry is an important tool for studying ecological processes and ecological functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zechmeister-Boltenstern S <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shang B <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>), which is mainly used to explore the dynamic balance of various elements and their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sterner &#x0026; Elser 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Moorthi S D <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). The C, N, and P concentrations are vital source elements in plants, and their changes in characteristics limit plant growth(Zeng Q <italic>et al</italic>. 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sperfeld E <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). It can be used to judge the nutrient limitation of plants and to reveal the utilization strategies of plants for nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sterner &#x0026; Elser 2002</xref>). At present, stoichiometry has been applied as a new ecological research tool to all levels, such as molecules, cells, individuals, communities and ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elser J J <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Elser J J <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yan Z B <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). With the changes of the global environment,terrestrial ecosystems have also undergone significant changes in the aspects of structure, process, function and vegetation distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freudenberger L <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Among them, the role of community ecological stoichiometry has become a hot issue for scholars all around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zechmeister B S et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bell D W <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang Y <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>.). The changes in plant ecological stoichiometry will contribute to nitrogen limitation, phosphorus limitation and both nitrogen and phosphorus limitations in the communities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seastedt T R <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reich P B <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elser J J <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>), which in turn affect community species diversity. It has been widely recognized that biological diversity plays an essential role in structuring communities and ecosystem processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tilman <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Naeem &#x0026; Li 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yachi &#x0026; Loreau 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Snyder <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haddad <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carlos Bustos-Segura <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Community species diversity is a complex measure of community structure and function, and it is also the material basis for maintaining ecosystem stability and sustainable production(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vilela D S <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pelini S L <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang C H <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saitta A <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). Therefore, the use of ecological stoichiometry knowledge to study plant communities and their relationship to species diversity can help to reveal the ecological strategies of plants in specific environments, and is of great significance to the circulation and balance mechanism of community materials.</p>
<p>Understanding nutrient element utilization of plant has long been focus of plant ecology (Frost P C <italic>et al</italic>. 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yan W <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Since the 1980s, ecological stoichiometry has been applied to ecology for the first time(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reinhardt S B <italic>et al</italic>. 1986</xref>), it has become an important method for plant ecology research, and has been widely praised by ecologists all around the world(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allen A P. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castellanos A E <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yu H <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yan W <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Most of the researches focuses on different ecosystem such as grassland ecosystem, forest ecosystem, wetland ecosystem and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yang Y H <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cao Y <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gra&#x017C;yna P <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). And the rare researches that pay attention to desert ecosystems. Many researches contents is about the C, N, P concentrations and the ratios of plants at the organ and individual levels, which also get the results that C, N, P concentrations and their ratios of different organs were significantly different, the different individuals too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zeng Q <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Halvorson H M <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). However, in different ecosystems, the strategies for plant utilization of nutrients in different plant communities are not the same.</p>
<p>The C:N:P ratio is also considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sardans J <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). For over a decade, evidence has accumulated suggesting a general trend towards the effect of community ecological stoichiometry on plant species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kerkhoff A <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu Z <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). Importantly, this work suggests that community ecological stoichiometry can be important for plant species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang J <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>).The existing researches are mostly stoichiometry of plant communities with different functional groups and changes in species diversity in different successional stages.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sardans J <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yan Z <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Soufbaf M <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). However, the relationship between plant community diversity and ecological stoichiometry in desert systems has not been well-studied to our knowledge.</p>
<p>China is one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth(Chen &#x0026; Bi 2007). Because northwestern China has been disturbed by climate change and by anthropogenic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang Q <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>), the plant communities of this region are extremely vulnerable and are expected to experience sharp reductions in population density in the future (Liu J <italic>et al</italic>. 2015). Plant communities in the upper reaches of the Tarim Desert are an especially fragile ecological zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gong Lu <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), but have been understudied. Hence, only a great understanding of the impact of ecology stoichiometry on plant species diversity is required to better know the reason of spatial distribution of plant speices, and in order to provide scientific basis for restructing and restoring the damaged ecological environment in the the upper reaches of the Tarim River. Here, we explore the following questions related to ecological stoichiometry and community diversity of this region: (1) what are the characteristic features of the community stoichiometry for this system? (2) to what extent does C, N, P contents of desert plants affect community diversity? The objectives of this study were to investigate whether desert plant community stoichiometry accounts for characteristics of trees, shrubs, and herbs, and to determine whether these relationships have any consequences for community diversity.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Study area</title>
<p>Data were collected in the northern region of the Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang, China (80&#x00B0;10&#x2019;-84&#x00B0;36&#x2019;E, 0&#x00B0;25&#x2019;-41&#x00B0;10&#x2019;N). The mean annual temperature of the area is approximately 10.4 &#x00B0;C, and the mean annual precipitation and evapotranspiration are roughly 50.4 mm, and 1800 mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gong L <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>)The dominant plant species in this desert community are <italic>Populus euphratica, Halostachys caspica, Tamarix chinensis, Phragmites communis, Lycium ruthenicum, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>. The diversity of the natural vegetation of this area is low. The soil composition mainly is sand (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Data were collected at three separate sampling zones within the upper reaches of the Tarim River (Northwest China in August of 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The three zones were selected so as to be in the same direction of the vertical river on the south side of the upper reaches of the Tarim River named T1,T2 and T3. According to the distance from the river, T1,T2 and T3 are in order. Within each of the three sampling zones, six individual plots were established to sample vegetation. The name rule about T1sample zone were T11,T12,T13,T14,T15 and T16. T2 sample zone and T3 sample zone naming rules were the same as T1 sample zone. Plots were spaced at intervals of at least 1 km within each sample zone, so as to avoid problems with pseudoreplication. This design resulted in a total of eighteen sampling plots. Plots were spaced at intervals of at least 1 km within each sample zone, so as to avoid problems with pseudoreplication. This design resulted in a total of eighteen sampling plots.</p>

<p>Different plot sizes were used to sample trees, shrubs and herbs.

For trees, we recorded species names, tag numbers, plant height, crown width, diameter at breast diameter (DBH).For shrubs and herbs, we recorded species names, number, height, crown width, and total percent ground coverage. Photographs were taken of each individual for all plant species sampled. Healthy individuals were collected in the plot area. We collected approximately 50 g of leaf material from these individuals, and placed them in numbered envelopes with appropriate amount of desiccant. After removing litter and stones, we took the top soil (0&#x2013;15 cm) of the plant crown using the quarter-division method.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>Experimental Analyses</title>
<p>Leaf samples were carefully cleaned and oven-dried at 60&#x00B0;C for two hours. Soil samples were air-dried after being sieved using a 2-mm mesh size, and visible roots and organic debris were removed by hand. All samples were then ground to a fine powder for element analysis (Soil Agrochemical Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bao S N, 2000</xref>). Total carbon content was determined by using the potassium dichromate external heating method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bao S N, 2000</xref>), total nitrogen content was determined using the Kjeldahl method(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bao S N, 2000</xref>), and total phosphorus content was determined using the molybdenum-antimony colorimetric method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bao S N, 2000</xref>). All analyses were repeated three times to take average.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2d"><title>Community diversity indices</title>
<p>Next, we calculated several community diversity indices. These were as follows:

<p>In the above equations, S is the total number of species in a plot, P<sub>i</sub> is the ratio of the number of individuals in a species to the total number of individuals in a community. N is the total nuber of individuals in a plot.</p></sec>
<sec id="s2e"><title>Community ecological stoichiometry</title>
<p>Leaf C,N, and P were used to calculate the importance values of each species in trees, shrubs and herbs. According to these importance values, the stoichiometric eigenvalues for all the species in the community were then weighted. In other words, the ecological stoichiometry of the community was the sum of the ecological stoichiometry of each weighted trees, shrubs or herbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yan E R, <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>)</p></sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Duncan post hoc multiple comparisons test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hsu J C. 1996</xref>.) to compare differences in C:N:P ratios among our communities.All statistical tests were assessed at a level of <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> &#x003D; 0.05. Linear regressions were then performed to describe the relationships between C, N, P, C:N, C:P and N:P. This analyses were conducted in SPSS software (SPSS for windows. Version 19.0, Chicago, IL, U,S,A.)</p>
<p>Redundancy analysis (RDA) was then used to explore the correlation between each community index and community ecological stoichiometric concentrations and ratios. Structal equation model ( SEM) was constructed to examine the relationship between plant community stoichiometry and plant community diversity. RDA and SEM were conducted in CANOCO 4.5 software (Wright M G. 2014) and AMOS 24.0 software (SPSS for windows. Version 24.0, Chicago, IL, U,S,A).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s3a"><title>The characteristic of plant community stoichiometry in different riparian zones</title>
<p>We found C concentration was greatest in T13 community in T1 zone and lowest in T31 community in T3 zone. Nitrogen concentration was greatest in T23 and was lowest in T14. Phosphorous concentration was greatest in T34 and was lowest in T22. All of the stoichiometric ratios (i.e., C:N, C:P and N:P) were greatest in zone 1 and were lowest in zone 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Significant difference in the stoichiometric concentrations and stoichiometric ratios were observed among same zones. Significant differences in stoichiometry and stoichimetric ratios were also observed among the different zones. In addition, N and P concentrations were not significantly different among T15, T25 and T35 types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The Simpson index was highest in the T13 community (0.623, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), and was lowest value in T31 (0.049, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The Shannon-Wiener index of the T11 and T16 communities was large, while the Shannon-Wiener index of the T31 community was smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The Margalef index ranged from 0.227 in T23 to 0.64 in T12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The T23 and T11 communities had higher Pielou&#x2019;s index values than the other communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

<sec id="s3c"><title>The correlation between plant community stoichiometry and plant community diversity</title>
<p>We used RDA to examine community diversity in more detail. The first axis explained 64&#x0025; of the variation, while the second axis only explained 2&#x0025;. As such, only axis 1 was a good reflection of the relationship between plant community stoichiometry and plant community diversity. In these biplots longer lines indicate stronger explanations, and smaller anglses indicate stronger correlations. The RDA indicated that the C:N ratio and N concentration played an important role in explaining plant community diversity among all concentrations and ratios. The Simpson&#x2019;s index was strongly positively correlated with P concentration, and was weakly positively correlation with C and N concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, the C:N and N:P ratios had a strong negative correlation with Simpson&#x2019;s index, and the C:P ratio showed a weak negative correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). A clear positive correlation emerged between the Shannon-Wiener index and C, N and P concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Likewise, a negative correlation among these ratios was found, and the remaining indices showed these simliar patterns as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the above studies, it can be seen that the effects of concentrations and ratios on plant community diversity index were different, but it is not possible to conclude that the concentration or ratio had the greatest impact on plant community diversity index. Therefore, we performed a Monte-Carlo test on three concentrations and three ratios, and obtained the order of importance of the stoichiometric variables. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. The important sequencing indicated that the most important element was N concentration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). We found that the N:P ratio was not as important for plant community diversity indices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). In order to further explore how C and N concentrations and C:N and C:P ratios potentially affect plant community diversity indices, we conducted a correlation analysis between single concentrations or ratios and plant community diversity indices. N, P concentrations and C:N, C:P ratios had great effect to four diversity indices. So to further explore the effects of these four important factors on the single plant community diversity index, We conducted a test of the impact of key concentration or ratio on the diversity index.The t-value biplot graph, if it falls into the circle with solid line, it means there is a significant positive correlation, and if it falls into the circle with dotted line it is a negative correlation. If the arrow line of the variable does not fall into the circle, indicating that the response variable has no correlation with this explanatory variable (Wright M G. 2014). Simpson&#x2019;s index, Pielou&#x2019;s index and the Shannon-Wiener index all fell within the real circle, and Margalef&#x2019;s index partly fell into the circle with solid line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This shows that N concentration was strongly positively correlation with Pielou&#x2019;s index, Simpson&#x2019;s index and the Shannon-Wiener index, and was weakly positively with Margalef&#x2019;s index. In other words, with an increase in N concentration, all of the indices become large. The C:N ratio revealed similar patterns as N concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Simpson&#x2019;s index and Shannon-Wiener index fell completely into the the circle with solid line, and Pielou&#x2019;s index and Margalef&#x2019;s index partly fell intothe circle with solid line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This explained that N concentration was strongly positively correlated with the Simpson&#x2019;s index, Pielou&#x2019;s index and Shannon-Wiener index, and was weakly positively correlated with Pielou&#x2019;s index and Margalef&#x2019;s index. The C:N ratio revealed similar patterns to those for C:P concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s4a"><title>The effect of vertical riparian distance on community ecological stoichiometry</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that C, N, and P concentrations in desert ecosystems is largely consistent with those from farmland ecosystems. These values may result from influences from oasis farmlands in the upper reaches of the Tarim River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Elser J J <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; Qu F <italic>et al</italic>. 2017). Indeed, our study area was adjacent to the Alar area. We observed large differences in C, N and P concentrations among different plant communities, and similar trends have also been reported for other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Behera S K <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Carbon concentrations were highest at T13 in T1 zone. This community has the largest number of <italic>Phragmites spp</italic>, which is a unique xerophilous plant in the study area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tuboi C <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). <italic>Phragmites spp</italic> are arid plants that like water, The T1 zone is closer to the water source than T2 zone and T3 zone, so a large amount of <italic>Phragmites spp</italic> grows in there. With the rapid growth of this species, the vascular bundles increase in the leaves and photosynthesis is enhanced, which may lead to the effective accumulation of organic matter in the leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Taysumov M A <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). The highest N concentrations were observed in the species of <italic>Alhagi sparsifolia Shap</italic>., which dominates the T23 community in T2 zone. <italic>Alhagi sparsifolia Shap</italic> is a naturally-growing and drought-tolerant plant, which absorbs groundwater and nutrients from the depths of the desert(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xiang Y L <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). If there is close to the water source, actually rich water, that is bad for <italic>Alhagi sparsifolia Shap</italic>, because it is a Xerophytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang B <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). On the contrary, there is far away from the water source, less water, can&#x2019;t meet the plant own growth needs. So the right amount of water is most beneficial for the growth of the plant. <italic>Alhagi sparsifolia</italic> Shap is a leguminous plant that has strong N fixing ability and utilization efficiency (Lei L <italic>et al</italic>. 2014). The T11,T12,T13,T14,T15 and T16 communities in T1 zone, contained a high abundance of <italic>Tamarix chinensis</italic> Lour and its P concentrations are relatively high. The leaves of <italic>Tamarix chinensis</italic> Lour are scaly and contain higher P concentrations than most other species. This is due to the special healing body of stem and leaf that can enhance photosynthesis and produce a proteinaceous substance that provides a protective membrane to resist harsh environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rong Q <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). The P concentrations of the <italic>Tamarix chinensis Lour</italic> is the highest of any species. All in all, the traits of plant leaves appear to be a reflection of the characteristics of the plants themselves, which further reflects the specificity of the absorption and utilization efficiency of elements involved in the process.</p>
<p>In general, N and P are assumed to be the two most limiting elements to plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Elser <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). We found a significant difference in N:P ratios among plant communities. Specifically, the N:P ratio were greater than 16 in some communities, indicating that these communities were strongly P-limited, and that other communities were more limited by N. In contrast, the plants in the upper reaches of the Tarim River are rarely restricted by N and P. A significant correlation between N concentration and C:N ratio in plant communities has been observed in other ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yan Z B <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; Yu H <italic>et al</italic>. 2015). Even in desert ecosystems, C and N concentrations maintain a strong intrinsic connection, which is important for plants. On the other hand, P concentration and C:P ratio also showed a significant correlation, and a similar situation was observed in other areas as well (Plach J M <italic>et al</italic>. 2015). These results indicate that the C:P ratio of communities in arid regions is also limited primarily by P concentration.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4b"><title>The effect of vertical riparian distance on community species diversity</title>
<p>The Simpson&#x2019;s index, Shannon-Wiener index, Margalef&#x2019;s index and Pielou&#x2019;s index all serve as indicators of community diversity. Our result showed that the communities of T1 zones had the highest Simpson&#x2019;s index values, indicating that they had strong anti-interference abilities. We believe that because of the river, it has been intermittently eroded by the Tarim River for a long time, making it more resistant to interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sures B <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bu C <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). However, other communities with poor anti-interference abilities have higher self-healing abilities after habitat destruction. This also indicates dominant species can play a leading role in maintaining community structure and ecological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang J <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>).The Shannon-Wiener index of the T11 and T16 communities in T1 zone were large, indicating that the structure and composition of these communities are more complicated. In contrast, the T31 community in T3 zone had a low value, and was this relatively simple. The T11 and T16 communities in T1 zone are located closer to the Tarim River Basin and are not subject to drought stress. The water resources are relatively abundant and thus more plant species are capable of surviving there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Merritt D M <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The T31 community in T3 zone is farther from the river, and only a handful of desert species that overcome drought stress have the ability to survive there. Pielou&#x2019;s index can reflect the distribution of species in the community, where T23 and T11had greater evenness.</p></sec>
<sec id="s4c"><title>The Relationship between plant community stoichiometry and plant community diversity</title>
<p>We found support for our hypothesis that plant community stoichiometry and plant community diversity were related. For example, each diversity index was significantly correlated with each stoichiometric concentration and ratio. We would this expect the stoichiometry of the community to be important at driving community diversity. Previous studies have found that C is the main element for plant, and compared with other nutrient concentrations, its concentration is high and stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heyburn J <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). However, C is not a key element that limits plant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Makino W <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; Heyburn J <italic>et al</italic>. 2007). Our results showed no significant correlation between plant community diversity and plant community C concentrations, further confirming this view. In this study, N and P were important to the plant community indices, and all showed a significant correlation with the N and P concentrations. This explains why changes in N and P concentration had an impact on plant community diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhao Y <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Both the increase and decrease of N and P concentrations will affect the growth rate of plants, which will then cause changes in plant community diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frenken T <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). The order of importance of community stoichiometry to community diversity shows that C:N and C:P ratios had significant impacts on community diversity. C:N and C:P ratios provide insight into plant&#x2019;s ability to absorb nutrients and assimilate carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bell D W <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>). To a certain extent, it can also reflect the nutritional efficiency of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu Z <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Different communities have different carbon sequestration efficiencies, while carbon accumulation efficiency and storage capacities are associated with N and P supplies that limit plant growth. Ultimately, our results show that plant growth and community diversity are closely linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Castellanos A E <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The SEM model also supported the notion that plant community stoichimometry is related to plant community diversity. The SEM was important at showing that these relationships are complex, and that no single plant community index or single concentration/ratio is apparent. The reason why the ecological stoichiometry characteristics can affect plant community diversity is due to Each plant community has different adaptation strategies for each element. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fan H <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). On the one hand, it may be that the plants themselves have different preferences for the elements, and different plant communities are formed, resulting in different plant diversity. On the other hand, owing to the restriction of N and P elements in the local soil, the diversity characteristics of plant communities change, and the diversity of plant communities also change.</p></sec></sec>
