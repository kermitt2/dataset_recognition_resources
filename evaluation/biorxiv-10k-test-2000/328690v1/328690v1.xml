<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>It has been recognized that the Merle coat pattern is not only a visually interesting feature, but it also exerts an important biological role, in terms of hearing and vision impairments. In 2006, the Merle (M) locus was mapped to the <italic>SILV</italic> gene with a SINE element in it, and the inserted retroelement was proven causative to the Merle phenotype. Mapping of the M locus was a genetic breakthrough and many breeders started implementing <italic>SILV</italic> SINE testing in their breeding programs. Unfortunately, the situation turned out complicated as genotypes of Merle tested individuals did not always correspond to expected phenotypes, sometimes with undesired health consequences in offspring. Two variants of <italic>SILV</italic> SINE, allelic to the wild type sequence, have been described so far - Mc and M.</p>
<p>Here we report a significantly larger portfolio of existing Merle alleles (Mc, Mc&#x002B;, Ma, Ma&#x002B;, M, Mh) in Merle dogs, which are associated with unique coat color features and stratified health impairment risk. The refinement of allelic identification was made possible by systematic, detailed observation of Merle phenotypes in a cohort of 181 dogs from known Merle breeds, by many breeders worldwide, and the use of advanced molecular technology enabling the discrimination of individual Merle alleles with significantly higher precision than previously available.</p>
<p>We also show that mosaicism of Merle alleles is an unexpectedly frequent phenomenon, which was identified in 30 out of 181 (16.6&#x0025;). dogs in our study group. Importantly, not only major alleles, but also minor Merle alleles can be inherited by the offspring. Thus, mosaic findings cannot be neglected and must be reported to the breeder in their whole extent.</p>
<p>In light of negative health consequences that may be attributed to certain Merle breeding strategies, we strongly advocate implementation of the refined Merle allele testing for all dogs of Merle breeds to help the breeders in selection of suitable mating partners and production of healthy offspring.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In dogs, coat color is a polymorphic and quite complicated issue. Since Little ([<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]1957) had described more than 20 loci affecting coat colors according to dog phenotypes, only a few genes have been recognized as being involved in the pigmentation &#x2013; the most prominent being locus E (MC1R gene, [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), locus K (CBD103 gene, [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), locus A (ASIP gene, [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), locus B (TYRP1 gene, [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), locus D (MLPH gene, [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), locus S (MITF gene, [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) and M locus (<italic>SILV</italic> gene, [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).</p>
<p>The Merle (M) locus was suggested by Little ([<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) as being responsible for Merle pattern, which is coat color where eumelanic regions are incompletely and irregularly diluted resulting in typical intensely pigmented patches. In 2006, the gene corresponding to the dominant allele of the M locus was finally recognized by Clark et al. [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Nevertheless, previous attempts were focused on factors, which are secreted primarily by keratinocytes (cells surrounding melanocytes) to stimulate the switch between phaeomelanin and eumelanin production ([<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). However, searching for the gene candidates responsible for Merle phenotypes excluded the genes involved in the melanogenic pathway, i.e., <italic>micropthalmia transcription factor</italic> (<italic>MITF</italic>), <italic>tyrosinase</italic> (<italic>TYR</italic>), <italic>tyrosine related protein</italic> (<italic>TYRP1</italic>), or <italic>dopachrome tautomerase</italic> (<italic>DCT</italic>) ([<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p>
<p>The Merle pattern can be seen in various breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd Dog, Australian Koolie, Border Collie, Dachshund, French Bulldog, Louisiana Catahoula, Labradoodle, Miniature American Shepherd, Miniature Australian Shepherd, Pyrenean Shepherd, Rough Collie, Shetland Sheepdog, Welsh Sheepdog, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Chihuahua, Great Dane etc. Merle is thought to be inherited in an autosomal, incomplete dominant way. Dogs heterozygous for the M allele show a typical coat pattern, however, dogs homozygous for the M allele may also exhibit auditory and ophthalmologic impairments and abnormalities together with very pale or completely white phenotypes (Strain et al. 2009). Such negative health effects associated with the M locus encouraged the research to identify a particular gene responsible. Clark et al. ([<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) confirmed the <italic>SILV</italic> gene as being the cause of the Merle pattern - the short interspersed element (SINE) is inserted in the structure of the gene. Clark et al. ([<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) has mapped the SINE insertion of approximately 253 bp at the intron 10 /exon 11 border of the <italic>SILV</italic> gene. A typical SINE element is composed of a body and a poly-A tail of variable length. It has been assumed that it might be the extent of the poly-A stretch, which plays the peculiar biological role, visually recognized as different qualities of the Merle coat pattern. It has been suggested that the poly-A tail, being a monotonous genomic structure, is prone to replication errors, caused by a slippage of the cellular replication machinery in such a challenging genomic context. It has also been observed that SINE inserts of different lengths do exist. Shorter SINE was ascribed to the allele Mc (Cryptic Merle) which has no apparent effect on the dogs&#x2019; phenotype, while longer SINE inserts were found to be responsible for the individual Merle phenotypes ([<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]).</p>
<p>This discovery enabled commercial testing of the Merle gene by various laboratories in different breeds worldwide. However, the occurrence and combinations of the above alleles could not explain various irregularities in dog phenotypes and unexpected results of breeding. In 2011, the Catahoula Club EU in the Czech Republic started testing the Merle gene within the Czech population of the Louisiana Catahoula (LC) breed in cooperation with Biofocus laboratory (Germany) ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). LC is the North American breed famous for its Merle (leopard) pattern, where, initially, no regulations for breeding of Merle to Merle individuals had been applied in the breeding strategies, contrary to other Merle carrying breeds, especially in Europe. Therefore, many dogs carrying the Merle gene can be expected within the breeding pool. The pilot testing by Biofocus proved that many unusual solid-color in appearance Catahoulas carry Merle alleles, but of a different SINE size than those found by Clark et al. ([<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). The middle-sized SINE allele has been named &#x201C;Atypical Merle&#x201D; (Ma) in order to distinguish it from those already known ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Further commercial testing, which started in 2015 and continues until now, has involved a wider LC population and later also other breeds and confirmed the Ma existence and its role in various specific and distinguishable Merle patterns ([<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p>
<p>Originally, only two alleles had been recognized by Clark et al. ([<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). However, unusual or unpredictable results of breedings, which cause unexplainable phenotypes of offspring, have confirmed the need for further research in this field. The length of SINE seems to be a key factor for the explanation of different effects on the final coat pattern. However, various commercial laboratories use different methods and instruments for SINE length detection. This can strongly influence final results, their accuracy, and ability to distinguish different alleles. Some laboratories have already acknowledged the existence of the Ma allele and have started reporting it. Other laboratories are still waiting for scientific confirmation, because a relevant study on this subject has not been published as of yet. There is also only limited and/or biased choice of dogs and breeds available for testing in particular studies ([<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Thus, it might be difficult to estimate the rate of occurrence for different Merle alleles in a given breed without a thorough population breed study. It is usually beyond the ability of any commercial laboratory, especially without a close cooperation with dog breeders of particular breeds. Solely collecting data from the Merle testing is not sufficient to properly evaluate a relationship between genotypes and phenotypes without knowledge of particular dogs and their relationships.</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the phenotype/genotype correlations between the individual Merle coat patterns and specific lengths of SINE in the <italic>SILV</italic> gene, i.e. to address genetically the extent of Merle alleles we have anticipated phenotypically in Lousiana Catahoula dogs, as well as in other Merle breeds (Australian Koolie, Australian Shepherd, Border Collie, French Bulldog and others).</p>
<p>Herein we confirm that in many Merle breeds, there exists a significantly higher number of Merle alleles than previously suggested. The individual Merle alleles can be distinguished according to their specific SINE lengths, corresponding unique Merle phenotypes and breeding results. To better understand the complexity of coat color genetics in Merle breeds, the <italic>SILV</italic> SINE gene genotyping has been complemented by a comprehensive Next Generation Sequencing genotyping of all known major coat color loci and their modifiers &#x2013; a test called SuperColorLocus, which we have developed.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals and sample collection</title>
<p>Biological material (buccal swab, hair, blood, sperm cells) was collected from 181 dogs (<italic>Canis lupus familiaris</italic>) of 14 breeds: Australian Shepherd Dog (ASD, 40), Australian Koolie (AK, 23), Border Collie (BC, 18), Dachshund (D, 9), French Bulldog (FB, 2), Louisiana Catahoula (LC, 73), Labradoodle (LD, 1), Miniature American Shepherd (MAS, 2), Miniature Australian Shepherd (MAUS, 2), Pyrenean Shepherd (PS, 1), Rough Collie (RC, 3), Shetland Sheepdog (SSD, 2), Welsh Sheepdog (WS, 3), and Mudi (M, 2).</p>
<p>The animals in the study were selected both for their visually detectable Merle phenotypes, and/or pedigree relationships with Merle-expressing individuals or individuals anticipated to carry the Merle allele. Dogs related by pedigree are listed in the Supplementary material (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>No dogs were housed for research purposes; all dogs were privately owned pets. The sampling of the biological material (buccal swab, hair, blood, sperm cells) was performed by veterinary practitioners or owners under written recommendations by the laboratory. All samplings were performed as a part of a routine commercial laboratory investigations for other routine laboratory genetical testing relevant for the breeding programs of the individual breeds recommended by the individual breeding clubs. All samples were non-invasive, causing no harm or pain to the animals and were contributed by the owners voluntarily as a part of a routine commercial laboratory testing for other purposes. No ethical commitee evaluation was applicable for this type of research. All owners have signed a written informed consent for the research, publication of results and pictures of their dogs.</p>

<title><italic>SILV</italic> SINE genotyping</title>
<p>A fragment of canine <italic>SILV</italic> gene with the potential SINE insertion ([<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) was PCR amplified using FAM-labelled forward primer (5&#x2032;atcaaggtcatgtaaacccaggcc 3&#x2032;) and reverse primer (5&#x2032; gtagccagtgggtgctaccacgtg 3&#x2032;) with QIAGEN Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, DE), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The PCR profile was the following: initial denaturation 95&#x00B0;C for 15 min, with 40 cycles 95&#x00B0;C/30 sec, 56&#x00B0;C/30 sec, 72&#x00B0;C/45 sec. PCR fragments were separated on ABI3500 genetic analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using fragment analysis module and the GeneMapper software, v5.0 plug-in.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>SuperColorLocus testing</title>
<p>SuperColorLocus (SCL) multiplex PCR product was prepared using QIAGEN Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, DE) and 200 nM each of forward and reverse primers to amplify the following genomic loci: Locus E - MC1R c.233G&#x003E;T, MC1R c.250G&#x003E;A, MC1R c.916C&#x003E;T, MC1R c.790A&#x003E;G; Locus K - CBD103 c.67_69del; Locus A - ASIP c.246G&#x003E;T, ASIP c.250G&#x003E;A, ASIP c.288C&#x003E;T; Locus B - TYRP1 c.121T&#x003E;A, TYRP1 c. 991C&#x003E;T, TYRP1 c.1033_1036del; Locus D - MLPH c.-22G&#x003E;A, PSMB7 c. 146T&#x003E;G. Locus S (MITFinsSINE) and ASIPinsSINE were analyzed using fragment analysis analogically to <italic>SILV</italic> SINE testing. Genotyping primers are available upon request.</p>
<p>To build NGS libraries, the SCL multiplex PCR product was end-trimmed, adapters-ligated and barcoded using NEBNext<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Fast DNA Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent&#x2122; (NEB, USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Built libraries were quantified using Ion Univ Library Quant Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and subjected to emPCR overnight, using OT2 semi-automatic platform (LifeTechnologies). After bead enrichment (OT2 platform), NGS sequencing chip was loaded (typically v 314 or 316) and sequenced (PGM, LifeTechnologies). Raw data has been analyzed using in-house, ISO 17025 - validated bioinformatic software for SNP genotyping.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Parentage testing</title>
<p>STR parentage analysis was performed using Canine ISAG STR Parentage Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The system has been validated for forensic use in dog paternity testing and evaluates 21 ISAG-recommended polymorphic STR markers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical data analysis</title>
<p>Data was obtained from 14 breeds, with various numbers of the individuals within each breed. Among the more frequent breeds, LC (73), ASD (40), AK (23), BC (18), and D (9) were used for a detailed analysis, while data from less frequent breeds, such as RC (3), WS (3), FB (2), M (2), MAS (2), MAUS (2), SSD (2), LD (1), PS (1), may have been used in overall calculations only (if not stated otherwise). Prevalence comparisons across all breeds may not have been performed in all cases because of the small subject numbers in some breeds. Therefore, we show here the qualitative differences found within the more populated breeds incuded in the study.</p>

<title>Refined <italic>SILV</italic> SINE genotyping</title>
<p><italic>SILV</italic> SINE fragments were separated in denaturing polyacrylamide gel on ABI3500 Genetic Analyzer to obtain the highest resolution possible for fragment analysis technology. ABI3500 allowed us to discriminate individual alleles differing in 1 nucleotide in length even for long PCR products (approx 500 bp). Using this approach, we were able to confirm the presence of the already recognized Merle alleles Mc and M, as well as also identifying novel Merle alleles and have named them Mc&#x002B;, Ma, Ma&#x002B; and Mh. Thus, we report here the presence of 7 individual types of Merle alleles and binned them as follows: The wild type allele bin was assigned a length of 171 bp, the bins for the other <italic>SILV</italic> SINE alleles are: Mc (200&#x2013;230 bp), Mc&#x002B; (231&#x2013;246 bp), Ma (247&#x2013;254 bp), Ma&#x002B; (255&#x2013;264 bp), M (265&#x2013;268 bp), and Mh (269&#x2013;280 bp).</p>

<title>Novel Merle alleles &#x2013; phenotype/genotype correlations</title>
<p>As well as the already recognized m, Mc and M alleles, we have identified four novel Merle alleles and termed them Mc&#x002B;, Ma, Ma&#x002B; and Mh. These alleles occur in classic heterozygous, but also in compound heterozygous combinations. All of them, classic heterozygous or compound heterozygous genotypes are associated with a typical, visually conspicuous phenotype. A detailed description thereof is given in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3a">Figure 3</xref>, which, for educational reasons, has been separated into individual sub<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3a">figures 3A-3X</xref>. All 7 Merle alleles, in theory, can make 28 individual allelic combinations (m/m, m/Mc, Mc/Mc, Mc/Mc&#x002B;, m/Mc&#x002B;, Mc&#x002B;/Mc&#x002B;, m/Ma, Mc/Ma, Mc&#x002B;/Ma, Ma/Ma, m/Ma&#x002B;, Mc/Ma&#x002B;, Mc&#x002B;/Ma&#x002B;, Ma/Ma&#x002B;, Ma&#x002B;/Ma&#x002B;, m/M, Mc/M, Mc&#x002B;/M, Ma/M, Ma&#x002B;/M, M/M, m/Mh, Mc/Mh, Mc&#x002B;/Mh, Ma/Mh, Ma&#x002B;/Mh, M/Mh, Mh/Mh).

<title>Genotype/phenotype correlations: Mh</title>
<p>The Mh allele has a broad range of phenotypes with 2 expressions that are very recognizable.</p>
<p>&#x0023;1 - &#x201C;Minimal Merle&#x201D; - a large percentage of the body features solid colored pigment with only small random areas of Merle patterning. Individuals may also express extended white out of the normal area of the typical Irish Spotting pattern &#x2013; this may include a large white collar, white up legs past the elbow, white past shoulders extending onto withers and white on the belly extending up the side. This extended white is sometimes associated with S/sp - (Piebald Carrier), however many m/Mh dogs with this type of white pattern have tested as S/S.</p>
<p>&#x0023;2 - The more classic pattern that is often referred to as &#x201C;Herding Harlequin&#x201D; - Random diluted areas of Merle pigment are deleted to white, leaving solid patched areas that may be Tweed patterned including different shades. Some Merle areas may remain. The extended white patterning mentioned in description &#x0023;1 may be present but is less noticeable due to the deleted white areas on the body.</p>
<p>&#x0023;3 - Some dogs may express more as m/M, yet are still able to produce offspring with a phenotype as described above in example &#x0023;1 and &#x0023;2 - these offspring have inherited the same length of base pairs as the parent and yet express in either of the 3 ways presented here. See <bold>Chart 1</bold>.</p>
<p><bold>Chart 1:</bold> In the following example, the dam - AF762 &#x2013; is distinguished by a Mh phenotype as described in &#x0023;1 - &#x201C;Mininal Merle&#x201D;. The two offspring &#x2013; AF758 and AF759 both have a Mh phenotype as described in &#x0023;2 - The more classic pattern that is often referred to as &#x201C;Herding Harlequin&#x201D; &#x201D;. Both dam and offspring have the same length of Mh - 271 bp.</p>
<p>Mc/Mh, Mc&#x002B;/Mh, Ma/Mh, M/Mh and Mh/Mh allelic combinations are phenotypically indistinguishable and present one homogenous phenotypic group.</p>
<p>Of note, M/Mh and Mh/Mh may express with a greater percentage of white over the body.</p>

<title>Abundance of the individual Merle alleles</title>
<p>We have calculated the relative frequency of the individual Merle alleles in our cohort of 181 dogs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, among all breeds tested in our study, dogs heterozygous for the wild type m allele were the most frequent (approximately one third of all individuals tested); M, Mh, and others followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). However, significant differences in their abundance have been revealed in the five most populated breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). LC carried Ma, M, and Ma&#x002B; (50.7, 39.7, and 34&#x0025; of tested dogs, respectively), while the m allele was present only in 34&#x0025; of the individuals tested. In contrast, most of AK, BC, D, and ASD were heterozygous for the m allele, as 100, 100, 78, and 60&#x0025; of the tested dogs, respectively, carried it. ASD showed besides m and Mh (60&#x0025;) also Mc (45&#x0025;) as the most frequent allele. In BC, Ma&#x002B; (44&#x0025;) was the most frequent allele, followed by m, Mh (33&#x0025;), and Mc (22&#x0025;). In our cohort of dogs, D have been found free of Mc, Mc&#x002B;, and Ma alleles, while Ma&#x002B; (78&#x0025;) was the most abundant allele, followed with M (44&#x0025;).</p>

<title>Merle mosaicism</title>
<p>Mosaicism of the Merle gene seems to be quite wide-spread among the Merle breeds. It is characterized by a presence of more than two M Locus alleles in tested samples.</p>
<p>We have found that 16.6&#x0025; of all dogs tested show Merle mosaicism, harboring 3 or more different M locus alleles in the tested sample. The ABI3500 semi-quantitive fragment analysis technology allows us to discriminate between a minor and major fraction of the summary peak signal for a given allele, and to use terms &#x201C;minor&#x201D; and &#x201C;major&#x201D; allele based on the height of the individual allelic peaks. Square brackets, [], are used to denote the minor allele/s.</p>
<p>Some mosaic results may explain an unusual phenotype that does not express as the two major alleles would be expected to. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref> shows three examples documenting this phenomenon.</p>
<fig id="fig7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<graphic xlink:href="328690_tbl3.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Interestingly, in three examples (AF038, AE943 and AF273) we observed that the longer Merle allele represented the minor allelic population, with the shorter allelic variant being the major allele. Nevertheless, we consider this more of an artifact caused by suboptimal quality of isolated DNA (random PCR bias leading to the amplification of shorter Merle fragment) rather than a real finding.</p>
<p>To test the mode of inheritance of these multiple allelic variants, we have tested STR &#x2013; proven pedigrees and have shown that mosaic alleles presented in the area of reproduction of egg and sperm from the parents can be distributed towards the offspring and can be identified based on their size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref> shows a typical pedigree exhibiting this phenomenon.</p>
<fig id="fig8" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig 8</label>

<graphic xlink:href="328690_fig8.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Interestingly, the Merle allelic status of mosaic animals can differ between biological materials tested, and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9</xref>, the findings in buccal swab (terminally differentiated epidermal derivative) can dramatically difer from the finding in sperm cells (germinal cell line). In this specific example, the proband, sire AF174, has been routinely tested using buccal swab and found out to carry [Mc]/Mh/Mh; ([212]/269/269), with the Mc allele representing the minor fraction. The dam, AF484, was genotyped as m/Mc&#x002B;; (m/231). Rather unexpectedly, their offspring, AF327, exhibited the following Merle genetic status: m/Mc&#x002B;; (m/235), with the 235 allele seemingly not to originate from either of the alleged parents. To exclude any parental mismatch, paternity has been confirmed using STR genotyping. Thus, in searching for the source of the Mc&#x002B; allele of 235 bp, Merle genotyping of the sperm cells of the sire, AF174, was performed. Rather interestingly, the Merle allelic genotype of the semen revealed a mosaicism of [Mc]/[Mc]/[Mc]/Mc&#x002B;]/Mh/Mh - ([213]/[220]/[230]/[235]/269/269). From this extensive Merle allelic pool identified in the sperm cells of the sire, the searched for Mc&#x002B; allele of 235 bp, has been passed to the offspring AF327.</p>
<p>Together with the phenomenon of consistent shortening of major Merle alleles in Merle mosaic animals observed in 27 out of 181 animals in our cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), the finding of semen as a source of a significant pool of minor Merle alleles, has led us to a hypothesis we herein propose &#x2013; unexpected Merle genotypes found in the offspring, not corresponding to the Merle genotypes obtained on other than germline cells in the parents, can be explained by the hidden pool of Merle alleles in the germline, undetectable in buccal swab or other differentiated tissues, rather than by the original theory of prolongation of shortened Merle alleles.</p>

<p>As discussed above, Merle allelic status might differ dramatically among the biological materials investigated. The following <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10</xref> shows the difference in Merle genotypes in the buccal swab (<bold>A</bold>) m/[Mc]/Mh &#x2013; (m/[230]/270), with the Mc allele being the minor one, and the hair (<bold>B</bold>) Mh/Mh &#x2013; (271/271) of a proband AE877. Since the hair was sampled from the Merle-exhibiting areas, the genotype Mh/Mh could have been expected. Still, the buccal swab has shown a wider portfolio of Merle alleles - m/[Mc]/Mh. Given the fact that the proband, AE877, is a female, it was not possible to analyze the Merle allelic status of her germline &#x2013; oocytes cannot be obtained non-invasively and we respect the animals.</p>

Similar to the case depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10</xref>, the reason for semen testing in proband AF132 was the offspring that exhibited Merle allelic status incompatible with the obligatory parental alleles identified using buccal swab in both sire and dam.

<p>Using the SuperColorLocus analysis we tested our cohort of dogs also for the major coat color loci (locus E, K, A) and their modifiers (locus B, D, S) to explain phenotypic features of the dogs in the study and also to evaluate a possible relation to the phenotype of dogs carrying Merle alleles. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> <bold>(The SuperColorLocus table)</bold> shows the coat color genotypes of all dogs in our study; all respective photographs of the animals can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Fig S3A-S3X</xref> in the Supplement section. We also evaluated the influence of S and D loci on the final phenotype of the Merle carrying dogs and found that the S locus does not seem to be a strong modifier of the resulting Merle phenotype. S locus genotype also seems to have minimal, if any, impact on health consequences connected with Merle phenomenon. Genotyping of the other coat color modifying loci &#x2013; E, K, A, B and D has shown an expected correlation with the actual phenotypes of the animals &#x2013; for comparison of coat color genotypes and phenotypes please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3a">Figs S3A-S3X</xref>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, during the genotyping process, we came across some irregularities, especially concerning the A locus in some Border Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs, where the SINE insert in the ASIP gene has been regularly missed. Similar phenomenon has been observed for B locus testing in French Bulldogs. To elucidate the genetic background of both recurrent genotyping errors, further research is warranted.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The Merle coat pattern has long been a fascinating feature for many breeders. It has attracted attention not only because of its visual uniqueness, but also for its negative health consequences, which have been observed rather frequently &#x2013; vision and hearing impairment of the affected animals. In 2006, Clark et al. [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] mapped the genomic abnormality to the <italic>SILV</italic> gene and identified a SINE element inserted at the vicinity of exon 10. SINEs (Short Interspersed Elements) are retroviral relics that parasitized the genome of vertebrates millions of years ago ([<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). SINEs are thought to be a great source of genome evolution, but have also been shown to be involved in many human genetic disorders and cancer, in animals also in peculiar phenotypic features, such as Locus A variants (alleles &#x201C;a&#x201D; and &#x002C;&#x002C; &#x201C;at&#x201D;).</p>
<p>A typical SINE element contains a poly-A tail, which harbors a stretch of homogeneous A nucleotide repetitions. This genomic feature poses a rather challenging situation for the cellular replication machinery and leads to a replication slippage and uneven replication products. This eventually leads to the senescence of the parasitic retroelement &#x2013; shortening of the poly tail under a critical level buries the element at its original site with no transposition activity left. As shown for <italic>SILV</italic> SINE, shortening of the primary poly-A tail leads also to the atenuation of the local effect of the SINE insert on the surrounding genomic environment, with visible phenotypic consequences.</p>
<p>It was originally assumed that the poly-A tail of SINE inserted in the <italic>SILV</italic> gene might not only shorten in time, but also extend its length. This information has previously been theorized based only on phenotype and not genotype. We have studied the pedigree of related dogs in our cohort as reported in the Supplementary data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>) and measured exactly the length of the obligatory alleles (within 1-2 bp size difference) and their passage from parent to the offspring, and siblings and cannot confirm this theory. We suggest, for the first time, that parental alleles are conserved in length between generations and it is highly probable that the alleged phenomenon of the poly-A extension does not exist. This finding is of special practical importance for breeders, as animals harboring critically shortened Merle alleles would not pose any danger in terms of health issues to their offspring and might safely be bred with full Merle individuals. Further research focused on precise monitoring of the length of Merle alleles is needed to clarify the poly-A dynamics of <italic>SILV</italic> SINE.</p>
<p>Another extremely interesting output of our study is the identification of a high degree of mosaicism in a high proportion of the animals tested. In 30 out of 181 dogs analyzed, more than one allelic type was identified. This finding was made possible by leveraging the high-resolution fragment analysis technology that allowed us to discriminate 7 allelic variants of the Merle gene, 4 of them (Mc&#x002B;, Ma, Ma&#x002B; and Mh) previously unknown. It is highly probably that the existence of various allelic variants mirrors the complex genomic situation during the early embryonic development, when populations of cells with different SINE allelic versions may arise. Importantly, the Merle genotype pattern, as we have found, m may differ among the individual compartments tested. Sperm cells are the most heterogeneous tissue in terms of Merle allelic variability, with the possilibity of many minor Merle alleles idenfied, which can be passed to the next generation in a Mendelian fashion. Buccal swab, generally used for routine genotyping, may not mirror the germline status, be it a terminally differentiated ectodermal tissue. This phenomenon must be taken into consideration especially in those cases, when buccal swab-genotyped animals produce an phenotypically unexpected offspring. In those instances it is strongly recommended to test sperm cells of the sire for possible mosaicism that would explain the unexpected breeding results. For males often used for breeding, we strongly recommnend to test their sperm cells first, to reveal Merle genetic background in full context and thus, address the possibility of passing minor Merle alleles to offspring. With females, the situation is complicated by the impossibility to obtain germinal cells. Nevertheless, to reveal possible mosaicism, hair from Merle looking coat areas can be tested in parallel with buccal swab.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the length of the SINE poly-A seems to be crucial as to the biological effects and phenotype correlations (pigment cells ontogenesis). Thus, critically shortened Merle alleles, exhibiting no visual pigment defects, such as Mc, Mc&#x002B; or Ma may also be expected to lose the biological effectsin terms of hearing or vision impairment development. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis, though more research is needed to elucidate this most important biological aspect of Merle biology. In line with it,(Moreover?) SINE inserts with a long poly-A tail, such as M or Mh may pose a greater risk of auditory or ophthalmic irregularities. It has been widely accepted that the most pronounced negative health consequences (both auditory and ophthalmic) are connected with the M/M genotype. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that even a heterozygous combination of m/Mh may exert the same effects &#x2013; in our cohort of 181 dogs we identified 10 dogs with the following genotypes with associated hearing and/or vision impairments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Fig 15</xref>):</p>

<graphic xlink:href="328690_fig15.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Harlequin Merle (Mh) also seems to explain more white in heterozygous Merle dogs.</p>
<p>An additional finding in our study considers the Tw &#x2013; Tweed locus, that has been theorized to be a modifier of Merle. Named after a Merle pattern that expresses with random shaded-in areas, usually with two or three distinguishable shades. Based upon results from our study, we challenge the existence of the Tweed allele and rather ascribe the Tweed phenotype to different combinations of <italic>SILV</italic> SINE Merle alleles, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3a">Figs 3A - 3X</xref></p>
<p>In conclusion, our study has brought to light novel findings in the field of Merle research and challenged some theorized data, which might exert undesirable effects on breeding strategies in Merle dogs. The results from our study are hoped to be instrumental not only to researchers working in the field of coat color genetics in dogs, but especially for breeders in developing their breeding strategies in Merle breeds &#x2013; to preserve the health of their animals to the fullest extent thenatural laws of population genetics allow.</p>
