<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sir2 is a highly conserved NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase that functions in heterochromatin formation and promotes replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Within the yeast rDNA locus, Sir2 is required for efficient cohesin recruitment and maintaining stability of the tandem array. In addition to the rDNA, ChIP-seq of an epitope-tagged cohesin subunit (Mcd1-13xMyc) in a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; mutant revealed subtle reductions of cohesin binding at all 16 centromeres. Coupled with the previously reported chromosome instability in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; cells and depletion of Sir2 in aged cells, we hypothesized that mitotic chromosome instability (CIN) due to Sir2 depletion could be a driver of replicative aging. In addition to Sir2, we discovered that other subunits of the Sir2-containing SIR and RENT complexes were depleted in aged cells, as were subunits of the cohesin and monopolin/cohibin complexes, implying the possibility of CIN. ChIP assays of the residual Mcd1-13xMyc in aged cells showed strong depletion from the rDNA and possible redistribution to centromeres, most likely in an attempt to maintain chromosome stability. Despite the shift in cohesin distribution, sister chromatid cohesion was partially attenuated in old cells and the frequency of chromosome loss was increased. This age-induced CIN was exacerbated in strains lacking Sir2 and its paralog, Hst1, but suppressed in strains that stabilize the rDNA array due to the deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> or through caloric restriction (CR). Furthermore, ectopic expression of <italic>MCD1</italic> from a doxycycline-inducible promoter was sufficient to suppress to rDNA instability in aged cells and to extend RLS. Taken together we conclude that age-induced depletion of cohesin and multiple other nucleolar chromatin factors destabilize the rDNA locus, which then results in general CIN and aneuploidy that shortens RLS.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The aging process is generally characterized by the breakdown of multiple cellular processes, including the maintenance of genome integrity. Alterations from the normal chromosome number is known as aneuploidy, and commonly occurs in oocytes (eggs) of older mothers. The risk of aneuploidy increases with age and can cause diseases such as Down&#x2019;s syndrome (chromosome 21 trisomy). It is therefore important to understand how aging causes the chromosome instability (CIN) that leads to aneuploidy. In this study we have investigated whether CIN is associated with aging of mitotic cells using the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as a model system. We show that chromosomes are indeed lost during aging of these cells due to the depletion of several key proteins that function in organizing and maintaining chromosome architecture, including the cohesin complex. Restoring cohesin levels was sufficient to delay aging, and adding extra cohesin even extended normal lifespan. Lastly, caloric restriction (CR), a dietary modification known to extend lifespan of yeast and other model organisms, strongly prevented chromosome instability, suggesting a possible new mechanism for how CR delays age-associated conditions at the cellular level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Budding yeast replicative lifespan (RLS) was originally described decades ago as the number of times a mother cell divides before losing viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and has been an effective model system for the identification and/or characterization of several conserved aging-related genes and pathways, including <italic>SIR2</italic>, AMPK (Snf1), and TOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. <italic>SIR2</italic> is probably the most famous yeast gene associated with replicative aging and encodes the founding family member of the NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-dependent histone/protein deacetylases, commonly known as sirtuins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]). The NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> dependence of sirtuins provides a direct link between metabolism and cellular processes regulated by these enzymes. In fact, recent evidence points to depletion of cellular NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pools as a potential mechanism for aging-associated disease, which could be mediated by impairment of sirtuins or other NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> consuming enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how sirtuins are impacted by aging and determining how they contribute to the regulation of age-altered cellular processes is of intense interest in the aging field.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic genomes generally encode for several different sirtuin homologs. The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome, for example, encodes <italic>SIR2</italic> and four additional <underline>H</underline>omologs of <underline>S</underline>ir <underline>T</underline>wo (<italic>HST1-HST4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Sir2 was originally shown to establish and maintain silencing of the silent mating loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, along with its fellow <underline>S</underline>ilent <underline>I</underline>nformation <underline>R</underline>egulator (SIR) proteins, Sir1, Sir3, and Sir4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Additionally, Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 form the so-called SIR complex that is recruited to and then spreads across the <italic>HM</italic> loci and telomeres to form hypoacetylated heterochromatin-like domains (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]). Sir2 protein levels are significantly reduced in replicatively old yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], presenting a possible mechanism for the decline of Sir2-dependent processes during aging, including gene silencing. Indeed, depletion of Sir2 in old cells causes hyperacetylated H4K16 and silencing defects at subtelomeric loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Haploid cells lacking Sir2 derepress <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, resulting in co-expression of mating type regulatory genes that together induce a diploid-like gene expression pattern that produces a non-mating &#x201C;pseudodiploid&#x201D; phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Old haploid mother cells are sterile, presumably due to the pseudodiploid effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], but more recent experiments point toward a silencing-independent mechanism caused by aggregation of the Whi3 protein and loss of pheromone sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Alternative models for Sir2 control of RLS have focused on the rDNA tandem array. Sir2 functions in the silencing of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription at the rDNA locus on chromosome XII via a nucleolar complex called RENT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], which consists of Sir2, Net1, and Cdc14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. RENT-dependent H3 and H4 deacetylation represses transcription of endogenous non-coding RNAs from the intergenic spacer (IGS) regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Derepression of the bidirectional promoter (E-pro) within IGS1 of <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; cells displaces cohesin from the rDNA, thus destabilizing the array by making it more susceptible to unequal sister chromatid exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. A predominant model for <italic>SIR2</italic> control of replicative aging postulates that extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) derived from these unequal recombination events specifically accumulate to high levels in mother cells, consequently causing cell death through an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Such an ERC-centric model is supported by the extended RLS extension of <italic>fob1</italic>&#x0394; strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Fob1 binds to the rDNA in IGS1 to block DNA replication forks from colliding with RNA polymerase I transcribing in the opposite direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The blocked replication forks can collapse and result in double-stranded DNA breaks that trigger the unequal sister chromatid exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The frequency of rDNA recombination and ERC accumulation is significantly reduced in a <italic>fob1</italic>&#x0394; mutant due to loss of the fork block, thus extending RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. This rDNA-centric model of replicative aging has been modified over the years such that overall rDNA instability, rather than ERC accumulation, is now considered the critical deleterious factor toward lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Strains with virtually no ERC accumulation in old cells, but a high frequency of rDNA recombination, are short-lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Also consistent with this idea, <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; still reduces RLS in a <italic>fob1</italic>&#x0394; strain that has limited ERCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. This raises several important questions, including 1) does Sir2 regulate RLS through mechanisms independent of the rDNA, and 2) how does rDNA instability shorten RLS? The experiments in this current study address both of these questions.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Sir2 is required for efficient cohesin association with the rDNA, with stabilization of the tandem array a major mechanism for maintaining replicative longevity. The cohesin complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> consists of four subunits, Mcd1/Scc1, Irr1/Scc3, Smc1, and Smc3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. The cohesin loading complex (Scc2/Scc4) deposits cohesin onto centromeres and other sites across the chromosome arms (including rDNA) during S-phase to maintain sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) until anaphase, when the Mcd1 subunit is cleaved by separase to facilitate sister chromatid separation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]). Cohesin defects result in chromosome instability (CIN) and aneuploidy due to improper chromosome segregation during mitosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, cells lacking <italic>SIR2</italic> or heavily overexpressing <italic>SIR2</italic> have increased rates of chromosome loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Aneuploidy has been shown to shorten yeast RLS by inducing proteotoxicity through improper expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that Sir2 could impact RLS by regulating mitotic chromosome segregation during aging.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated a potentially novel role for Sir2-limited yeast RLS through maintenance of accurate chromosome segregation. In the process, we uncovered chromosome instability and SCC defects in aging yeast cells that correlated with reduced levels of cohesin and cohesin loader subunits. Forcibly manipulating Mcd1 subunit levels was sufficient to modify RLS, suggesting a causative relationship to aging. Interestingly, cohesin association with chromosome arms and the rDNA was generally reduced in old cells, but maintained or even increased at centromeres, suggesting a programmed mechanism by which SCC is preferentially maintained at centromeres to ensure cell viability. However, this comes at the expense of chronic rDNA instability that is exacerbated by age-induced reductions in the RENT and cohibin/monopolin complexes. Lastly, reducing rDNA instability by deleting <italic>FOB1</italic> suppressed the general CIN phenotype in aged cells, leading to a model whereby rDNA instability caused by cohesin depletion drives the defects in mitotic segregation of other chromosomes during replicative aging.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We previously reported a statistically significant overlap in genome-wide Sir2 binding sites measured by ChIP-seq with cohesin binding sites measured by ChIP-Chip microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], consistent with the idea of a functional relationship between the two. Since deleting <italic>SIR2</italic> reduced cohesin recruitment at individually selected loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], including the rDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], we decided to explore this result further using ChIP-Seq with exponentially growing WT and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; strains in which the Mcd1 subunit of cohesin was C-terminally tagged with 13 copies of the myc epitope (13xMyc). A composite plot of the sequencing data normalized to 1X read coverage indicated both replicates of the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; strain exhibited dramatically reduced levels of Mcd1-myc binding within the rDNA locus as compared to the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). This result was confirmed with ChIP-qPCR using an IGS1 primer pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) and supported earlier ChIP results from the Nomura lab showing that cohesin recruitment to the rDNA requires Sir2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. It was also reported that cohesin released from the rDNA in a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; mutant preferentially relocalized to pericentromeric regions as measured by fluorescence microscopy of GFP-tagged Smc3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. We attempted to recapitulate this result by creating a composite profile of all 16 centromeres but did not detect the same pericentromeric enrichment of Mcd1-myc in our <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; ChIP-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). There was instead a trend toward reduced cohesion association. Standard ChIP assays also did not reveal evidence of significant centromeric or pericentromeric enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the ChIP signal was diluted within an asynchronous cell population, compared to the microscopy data that examined mitotic cells.</p>

<title>Cohesin levels are depleted in old yeast cells</title>
<p>Strains deleted for <italic>SIR2</italic> are short lived, but they likely do not fully recapitulate all cellular changes that accompany normal replicative aging. We therefore hypothesized that more severe effects of cohesin localization at centromeres could be uncovered by comparing replicatively young vs. old cells in which Sir2 protein levels naturally declined. To isolate sufficient quantities of old cells for ChIP assays we turned to <underline>M</underline>other <underline>E</underline>nrichment <underline>P</underline>rogram (MEP) strains developed by the Gottschling lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The aged cell purification procedure was validated by increased bud scar staining with calcofluor white and by the expected reduction of Sir2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). The vacuolar protein Vma2, used as a loading control, does not deplete with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and detailed bud scar and protein quantitation from triplicate biological samples are reported in S1 Fig. Since Sir2 is the catalytic subunit of both SIR and RENT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>), it was important to know which complexes were impacted by age. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>, Sir4 was depleted in old cells while Sir3 was not. Such a stark difference was considered highly relevant because Sir2 and Sir4 tightly interact as a heterodimer that associates with the acetylated H4 N-terminal tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Sir3 is subsequently recruited following H4K16 deacetylation to complete SIR holocomplex formation on heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Myc-tagged Net1 (RENT complex) was also depleted from old cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>), indicating that Sir2/Sir4 and the RENT complex are both depleted during replicative aging, thus revealing a previously unrecognized level of specificity in age-related Sir2 protein homeostasis. It should be noted that the Sir2 paralog, Hst1, which has the capacity to compensate for loss of Sir2, is also partially depleted from old cells (S2A Fig).</p>

<p>Considering the depletion of multiple heterochromatin factors in old yeast cells and the generally reduced Mcd1-myc ChIP signal in <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; cells, we hypothesized that cohesin complex levels may also drop in old cells. We attempted to individually myc-tag three different subunits of cohesin (Mcd1, Smc1, and Irr1) in the MEP strain background. All cohesin subunits are essential, and only two of the tagged proteins (Mcd1 and Smc1) were functional based on recovery of viable cells and proper size on western blots. Both of these subunits were significantly depleted in old cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2F</xref> and S2B Fig), indicating the entire cohesion complex was affected. Furthermore, a Myc-tagged Scc2 subunit of the Scc2/Scc4 cohesin loading complex was age-depleted (S2C Fig), predicting that cohesion complex association with chromatin should be generally sparse. ChIP assays for Mcd1-myc in aged cells did demonstrate strong depletion from the rDNA intergenic spacer IGS1 as expected, but binding was surprisingly enhanced at the centromere of chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G</xref>). Sir4-myc, on the other hand, was depleted from <italic>TELXV</italic> in old cells (one of its normal targets) without shifting its enrichment to centromeres (<italic>CEN4</italic>) or the rDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2H</xref>), indicating that not all age-depleted proteins become enriched at centromeres. From these results we conclude that as cohesin is depleted during replicative aging, a significant portion of the remaining complex is retained and potentially redistributed to centromeres, consistent with an earlier finding that cohesin preferentially associates with pericentromeric regions instead of chromosome arms when Mcd1 expression is artificially reduced below 30&#x0025; of normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>

<title>Sister chromatid cohesion is compromised in old yeast cells</title>
<p>SCC was surprisingly normal despite artificially reduced Mcd1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], leading us to ask whether cohesion would be maintained in old yeast cells that were also depleted of cohesin. To this end, we utilized strains with LacO arrays located approximately 10 kb away from centromere IV (<italic>CEN4</italic>) or on the arm of chromosome IV at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus located approximately 400 kb away from the centromere as proxy for arm cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Differential positioning of the array had no significant impact on RLS (S3 Fig). SCC was monitored by LacI-GFP appearing either as one dot in the case of maintained cohesion or two dots in the case of cohesion loss. Using an <italic>mcd1-1</italic> temperature sensitive mutant as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], we observed a significant increase in two dots when cells were synchronized in mitosis with nocodazole and shifted to 37&#x00B0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A and B</xref>). WT cells were next biotinylated and aged for 24 hours, followed by purification with magnetic streptavidin beads. The maximum bud scar count was 13, which was roughly half the maximum lifespan for this strain as measured by RLS assay. There was a trend toward lost centromere and arm cohesion in old cells (&#x003E;5 bud scars) when cultures were synchronized in mitosis with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C, D, and E</xref>). When cells were not arrested with nocodazole and only large budded (mitotic) cells were analyzed, significant cohesion loss was observed in old mother cells compared to young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E and F</xref>). Therefore, the limited amount of cohesin complex remaining in old cells is functional, but has difficulty maintaining SCC when microtubules are naturally allowed to exert pulling force on centromeres.</p>

<title>Chromosome instability (CIN) increases during replicative aging</title>
<p>Based on the cohesion defect in aged yeast cells, we next asked if they also display elevated chromosome instability. Strains for this experiment have an artificial chromosome III bearing a suppressor tRNA gene, <italic>SUP11</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Loss of the chromosome prevents suppression of an ochre stop codon in <italic>ADE2</italic>, resulting in the classic <italic>ade2</italic> red colony phenotype. The frequency of nondisjunction events was measured by counting half-sectored red/white colonies from young and aged cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). A <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; mutant was included in the experiment because it was previously reported to increase CIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], as was an <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; mutant because of its potential for functional overlap with Sir2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Sectoring was elevated in young populations of <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; mutants, and additively elevated in a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, sectoring was even higher for aged populations of each strain, suggesting an independent age-associated factor was involved. We next tested whether the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; effect on sectoring was related to the pseudodiploid phenotype caused by derepression of the <italic>HM</italic> loci. This reporter strain background was <italic>MAT&#x03B1;</italic>, so we deleted <italic>HMR</italic> (chrIII 293170-294330) to eliminate the a1/a2 transcription factors, and then confirmed reversal of the pseudodiploid phenotype by restoration of mating to the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; <italic>hmr</italic>&#x0394; strains (data not shown). Importantly, this procedure significantly suppressed sectoring of the young <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; mutants, but not the <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>, middle panel), indicating there was indeed a sir2&#x0394;-induced pseudodiploid effect that suppressed CIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>, middle panel). Aging increased sectoring in each strain even when <italic>HMR</italic> was deleted, indicating the aging-associated CIN factor was unrelated to mating type control.</p>

<p>Even though SCC was unaffected by forced cohesin depletion, rDNA array condensation and stability were significantly impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that age-induced chromosome instability could be related to rDNA instability caused by natural Sir2 and cohesin depletion. To address this idea, <italic>FOB1</italic> was deleted to stabilize the rDNA and the sectoring phenotype retested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref> (right panel), the age-associated increase in chromosome instability for each mutant was generally reduced to that observed with young <italic>FOB1</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>, left panel), consistent with rDNA instability driving overall CIN.</p>
<p>What could be the mechanistic connection between the rDNA and centromeres? Previous Hi-C analysis of the yeast genome and fluorescence microscopy of nucleolar proteins positioned the rDNA off to one side of the nucleus, apparently secluded from the rest of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. The repetitive nature of rDNA precludes it from appearing in Hi-C contact maps, but closer inspection of chromosome XII at 10 kb resolution indicated a clear interaction between unique sequences flanking the centromere-proximal (left) edge of the array and <italic>CEN12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>). Further analysis of observed/expected contacts using HOMER revealed a looped structure between the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>), which was recently reported to occur during anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, all centromeres in the yeast genome, including <italic>CEN12</italic>, cluster together in Hi-C contact maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4E</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]), which by default also places them in contact with the left flank of the rDNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the rDNA comes in close contact with centromeres during mitosis, providing a potential window of time for rDNA instability to physically impact the integrity of general chromosome segregation.</p>

<title>Growth on galactose induces CIN and shortens RLS</title>
<p>Since Sir2 and cohesin are both naturally depleted from replicatively aging yeast cells, and mild Sir2 overexpression extends RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], we hypothesized that manipulating cohesin expression levels would also impact CIN and RLS. We initially attempted to overexpress the Mcd1 subunit from a galactose inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and then measure minichromosome loss frequency by counting &#x00BD; sectored colonies. However, simply growing the reporter strain in galactose-containing media, even with an empty expression cassette, resulted in severe minichromosome loss compared to glucose-containing media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5A and B</xref>). This effect was specific to galactose, as growth with another non-preferred carbon source (raffinose) had no effect on sectoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). We next measured RLS with the minichromosome reporter strain on YEP plates with 2&#x0025; glucose, galactose, or raffinose. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>, galactose decreased the mean RLS by &#x007E;50&#x0025; compared to glucose (9.2 vs. 18.9 divisions), while raffinose only marginally decreased lifespan to an average of 15.5 cell divisions. To confirm the galactose effect on RLS was not specific to the minichromosome strain, RLS assays were repeated with the well-characterized strains BY4741 (<italic>MAT</italic>a) and BY4742 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#x03B1;). Again, a significant decrease in mean lifespan was observed for BY4741 (17.7 divisions) and BY4742 (18.9 divisions) on galactose as compared to glucose (24.3 and 24.2 divisions, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>), suggesting that galactose triggers high rates of CIN through an unknown mechanism that also shortens RLS.</p>

<title>RLS is modulated by Mcd1 expression levels</title>
<p>To circumvent the use of galactose for <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression we turned to an inducible &#x201C;Tet-On&#x201D; promoter that is activated by doxycycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Strains harboring this integrated cassette transcriptionally overexpressed <italic>MCD1</italic> approximately 7-fold compared to the empty vector control (S4 Fig). <italic>MCD1</italic> was overexpressed in a &#x201C;WT&#x201D; strain (JH5275b) and a mutant (JH5276b) containing an ochre stop codon in the <italic>MCD1</italic> open-reading frame (<italic>mcd1L12STOP</italic>) that reduced Mcd1 protein levels to &#x007E;30&#x0025; of normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. With an empty pRS405 control vector integrated, <italic>mcd1L12STOP</italic> exhibited a 40&#x0025; reduction in mean RLS (9.9 divisions) compared to WT (16.5 divisions), and overexpressing <italic>MCD1</italic> almost fully restored mean RLS to the mutant (14.7 divisions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). Especially intriguing was the observation that <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression extended mean RLS in the WT background to 19.6 division, an increase that was primarily due to improved survival during the first &#x007E;15 divisions, followed by a steeper decline later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). This biphasic pattern was highly reproducible, as it was observed in three independent RLS experiments. Mechanistically, there could be a secondary age-related event at the RLS mid-point that is beyond rescue by ectopic <italic>MCD1</italic> expression. Alternatively, doxycycline-induction could eventually be attenuated due to the extended incubation times of RLS assays. Either way, the results clearly indicate that similar to Sir2, the Mcd1 subunit of cohesin is a dosage-dependent longevity factor.</p>

<p>Previous studies reported that Sir2 was required for efficient cohesin association with the rDNA due to silencing of E-pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], implying that Sir2 was upstream of cohesin. This functional relationship could be more complex in the context of RLS, especially since both factors are depleted with age. To explore further, we tested whether <italic>SIR2</italic> overexpression could rescue the short RLS of an Mcd1-depleted <italic>mcd1L12STOP</italic> strain by integrating a second copy of <italic>SIR2 (2xSIR2</italic>) at the <italic>LEU2</italic> locus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>, <italic>2xSIR2</italic> partially rescued mean RLS of the <italic>mcd1L12STOP</italic> strain (14.1 versus 9.9 divisions), and also increased maximum RLS of the WT strain as expected. Reciprocally, we asked whether <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression could suppress the short RLS of a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; mutant. The double mutant was chosen to avoid any redundancy between the two sirtuins. Mean RLS was clearly not increased by <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression as compared to empty vector (10.1 versus 9.7 divisions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C</xref>), confirming that <italic>SIR2</italic> was upstream of <italic>MCD1</italic> in regulating RLS.</p>
<p>Considering the strong depletion of cohesin from rDNA in old cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G</xref>), and extended RLS when <italic>MCD1</italic> was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>), we next tested whether aging-induced rDNA instability was suppressed by <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression using a reporter strain harboring <italic>ADE2</italic> in the rDNA array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. There was a large increase of red/white sectoring (marker loss) in old cells that was suppressed upon <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6D</xref>). In the absence of <italic>SIR2</italic>, however, red/white sectoring was high in both young and old cells when the empty vector (pRF10) was integrated, and <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression did not significantly reduce rDNA instability in either population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6D</xref>), indicating that at least some Sir2 was required for Mcd1 to impact rDNA stability. We conclude that loss of Sir2 and cohesin in aging cells causes rDNA array instability that exacerbates CIN.</p>

<title>RLS extension by CR correlates with improved chromosome stability</title>
<p>Reducing glucose concentration in the growth medium is effective at extending RLS and is considered a form of caloric restriction (CR) for yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. There have been several hypotheses put forth for the underlying mechanisms, including stabilization of the rDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Since <italic>MCD1</italic> overexpression suppressed rDNA recombination and extended RLS, we hypothesized that CR would suppress the shortened RLS of a cohesion-depleted <italic>mcd1L12STOP</italic> mutant strain. Indeed, CR extended RLS of both the WT and <italic>mcd1L12STOP</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>). However, the suppression was apparently not due to maintenance of global cohesion levels because steady state Mcd1-13xMyc was still depleted in restricted old cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). CR also strongly suppressed minichromosome loss in young and aged cells, even in the <italic>sir2</italic>&#x0394; <italic>hst1</italic>&#x0394; double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>).

<title>Nuclear protein depletion during replicative aging as a paradigm for aging pathologies</title>
<p>During this study the majority of chromatin-associated proteins analyzed by western blotting were depleted in replicatively aged yeast cells. The only protein unaffected by age, other than the vacuolar Vma2 control, was Sir3. A similar proportion of homologous recombination proteins were depleted in an independent analysis of old cells, with Rad52 the only one not affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. These results indicate there is at least some selectivity to the depletion of nuclear proteins in old cells. However, the large number of depleted factors also makes it likely that targeted nuclear protein deficiency could lead to multiple age-associated phenotypes. Replicatively aging yeast cells appear especially susceptible to this phenomenon, as even total core histone levels are depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Evidence also exists for histone depletion during aging of metazoan organisms, including mammals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]). More generally, global protein turnover is elevated in cells from prematurely aging progeria patients, which may trigger higher translation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. This is significant because reducing translation is a means of extending lifespan in multiple organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Ribosomal proteins appear to accumulate in old cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], again consistent with protein synthesis being a driver of aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. The mechanism(s) driving nuclear protein depletion in old yeast mother cells remain unclear.</p>
<p>The specificity for Sir2/Sir4 depletion over Sir3 is intriguing given that Sir2 and Sir4 form a tight complex that allosterically stimulates the deacetylase activity of Sir2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Sir2/Sir4 also binds to H4K16-acetylated chromatin independent of Sir3, which is subsequently recruited to complete the SIR holocomplex once H4K16 is deacetylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The mechanism for Sir2/Sir4 depletion from old cells remains uncharacterized, though in non-aging cell populations the stability/turnover of Sir4, but not Sir2, is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase San1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], which has also been implicated as a quality control E3 ligase for mutated/unfolded nuclear proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Whether San1 controls Sir4 stability during aging remains unknown, but since Sir4 is more severely depleted than Sir2 in old cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>), Sir4 could be selectively depleted from the SIR complex, thus leaving Sir2 unprotected and then subject to turnover through a different mechanism. Alternatively, Sir2/Sir4 could be equally depleted as a complex from telomeres and the <italic>HM</italic> loci (not necessarily via San1), leaving the nucleolar pool of Sir2/RENT as more resistant to aging. Under this scenario, protecting the integrity of the rDNA array could take precedence over other heterochromatic domains. Interestingly, the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> San1 ortholog has also been implicated in a chaperone-assisted degradation pathway that functions in quality control of kinetochores to promote chromosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>Sir2 depletion in replicatively aged yeast cells is reminiscent of Sirt1 depletion in serially passaged mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which correlates with declining mitotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Sir2 and Sirt1 are both known to function in regulating DNA replication origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], and the effect of deleting <italic>SIR2</italic> on early origin firing is thought to be mediated by competition for limiting factors with the repeated rDNA origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Furthermore, CR has been proposed to extend RLS by reducing rDNA origin firing, which improves overall genome replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Therefore, depleted cohesin in old cells could potentially cause rDNA instability by impacting DNA replication.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>A precarious balance between rDNA and centromeric cohesion</title>
<p>Sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) ensures chromosomes are not segregated until the Mcd1/Scc1 cohesin subunit is cleaved in response to a mitotic spindle checkpoint signal that all chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules and aligned at the metaphase plate (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]). Cohesin is also critical during meiosis, and it is well established in mammals that SCC defects occur in the oocytes of older mothers, causing meiotic chromosome missegregation events during both anaphase I and II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. This phenomenon is believed to be a major mechanism for increased aneuploidy risk that usually results in embryonic lethality, or in the case of chromosome 21 trisomy, Down&#x2019;s syndrome in children. The meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8 is depleted in the oocytes of older mice, as is Shugoshin (Sgo2), which normally protects/maintains centromeric cohesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. More recent experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that oxidative stress in aged oocytes contributes to the SCC defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Our results in replicatively aging yeast cells reveal that aging-induced cohesin depletion and the resulting chromosome missegregation can extend to mitotic cells. Though cohesin depletion or defects have not been reported for mammalian somatic cells, the mitotic spindle checkpoint protein BubR1 is depleted in dynamic somatic tissues such as spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Deficiency of this protein results in premature aging phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], while overexpression extends lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. This is similar to the effects we observe with Mcd1 depletion and overexpression on yeast RLS. Interestingly, BubR1 is also a deacetylation target of Sirt2, which appears to stabilize the protein and extend lifespan, thus linking mitotic spindle checkpoint regulation to NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. It remains unclear if Sir2, Hst1, or other sirtuins regulate the yeast BubR1 ortholog, Mad3, or additional checkpoint and kinetochore proteins.</p>
<p>SCC is the canonical function for cohesin, though the complex also functions in establishing and regulating genome organization at the level of chromatin structure, gene regulation, and double strand break (DSB) repair (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]). Among these various processes, SCC at centromeres appears the most critical because artificial depletion of Mcd1 to &#x003C;30&#x0025; of normal levels results in preferential cohesin binding to pericentromeric regions rather than cohesin associated regions (CARs) on chromosome arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. SCC was also well maintained in these strains at the expense of normal chromosome condensation, DNA repair, and rDNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In aged yeast cells we observed relative enrichment of Mcd1-myc at centromeres as compared to loss at the rDNA (IGS1) locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G</xref>), suggesting an attempt by cells to maintain centromere cohesion at all costs, similar to what occurred in the artificially depleted system. Despite maintaining the cohesin complex at centromeres, SCC was still impaired in the older cells, especially when tension was maintained. In contrast, an independent study that analyzed significantly older mother cells (&#x007E;20 generations) than in our study (&#x007E;6 generations) observed reduced cohesin enrichment at centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Collectively, the results suggest that centromere-associated cohesin is preferentially retained during the initial stages of replicative aging, but then eventually breaks down below a critical threshold in the oldest cells.</p>
<p>Numerous nuclear proteins are depleted in old yeast cells, not just cohesin subunits, so we hypothesize that defects in other nuclear processes mediated by such factors also contribute to SCC defects and chromosome instability either directly or indirectly. The depleted cohesin loading complex (Scc2/4) is an obvious candidate due to its role in loading cohesin onto chromatin. Similarly, the depleted Lrs4/Csm1(cohibin complex) is proposed to act as a cohesin clamp onto rDNA chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>], and also functions at centromeres to maintain mitotic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Sir2 and Hst1 are also obvious candidates given the earlier finding that H4K16 deacetylation at centromeres by Sir2 helps maintain chromosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Hst1 also binds centromeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], though the functional relevance of that association remains uncharacterized. The suppression of age-associated mini-chromosome loss in the absence of <italic>FOB1</italic> clearly points to rDNA instability as an unexpected source of general CIN. Such a relationship is reinforced by the observed depletion of nucleolar proteins Net1 and Lrs4 in old cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2E</xref> and S2D), both of which are required for normal rDNA/nucleolar integrity and stable cohesin association with the rDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>].</p>
<p>How could destabilization of the rDNA locus result in general chromosome instability and shortened RLS? As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, unique sequence flanking the rDNA on chromosome XII contacts the centromere of each chromosome, including XII. Whether the actual rDNA genes contact centromeres remains unclear due to the limitations of Hi-C analysis with repetitive DNA. However, specific regions of the rDNA were previously shown to associate with various non-rDNA chromosomal regions using an anchored 4C approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. Loss of cohesin from the rDNA could potentially disrupt long-range interactions with centromeres or non-centromeric regions of cohesin association that influence chromosome integrity. One potential mechanism could be significant disruption of overall chromosome condensation during mitosis, as the cohesin appears to play the major role in chromosome condensation in budding yeast instead of the condensin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], which is different from metazoan organisms where condensin is the primary condensation machinery.</p>
<p>Interestingly, another class of nuclear factors depleted in old yeast cells are several DNA repair proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Consequently, the lack of proper DNA repair while the rDNA becomes destabilized correlates with fragmentation of chromosome XII and the other chromosomes, with rDNA sequences actually being transferred into the other chromosomes. It was proposed that accumulation of breaks and rearrangements ultimately causes cell death during replicative aging. Such cells were significantly older (&#x003E;25 divisions) compared to the cells in our study, which averaged 5-6 divisions. Alternatively, it is possible that these presumably random rearrangements disrupt normal SCC, leading to CIN.</p>

<title>Aneuploidy as an aging mechanism</title>
<p>All 16 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosomes harbor essential genes, so if a single chromosome is lost from a haploid yeast cell, then the affected mother or daughter cell should become inviable and no longer divide. Given the elevated frequency of chromosome loss during replicative aging, the chances of generating an inviable mother cell during a replicative aging assay increases after each subsequent division. Therefore, at least a portion of the replicative lifespan in haploid yeast cells is controlled by the ability to maintain all 16 chromosomes. Complete loss of a chromosome would not be an immediate viability issue for diploid cells, however, as the chances of losing both homologs in a single mitosis are exceedingly rare. On the other hand, haploid strains that are disomic for individual chromosomes are often short lived, with longer chromosomes typically having larger effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. It was hypothesized that such strains suffer from proteotoxic stress due to inappropriate protein expression levels. Therefore, a similar mechanism could shorten RLS in a diploid strain that is trisomic for an individual chromosome, though this has not yet been tested. Aneuploidy is also a hallmark of aging in the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>], and somatic tissues of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], making it a conserved feature of aging from yeast to humans.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature of this study is the suppression of CIN by CR growth conditions that extend RLS. This effect was independent of the reduced cohesin levels in aged cells, and even improved RLS of the cohesin-depleted strains. Since SCC is normal in the cohesin-depleted strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], we hypothesize that CR reinforces other processes that are defective due to reduced cohesin or other depleted factors that promote rDNA stability. Indeed, CR is known to suppress rDNA instability in yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], and improve overall genome replication efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Hi-C analysis also suggests there could be direct effects of rDNA structure on centromere function, which will be the focus of future investigation.</p>

<p>Two large scale cultures (1.5 L) were used for each western blot experiment corresponding to approximately 2&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> total old cells after purification. Cells were pelleted using a Sorvall RC-5B Plus centrifuge with an SLA-3000 rotor at 2000 rpm, and then resuspended at a density of 6&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL in RNAlater (Ambion) for 45 minutes in two separate conical tubes. Following fixation, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 45 mL of cold 1&#x00D7;PBS, 2 mM EDTA in 50 mL conical tubes. The mixture was incubated at 4&#x00B0;C for 30 min with 800 &#x03BC;L of Streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec), which were then purified through an autoMACS Pro Cell Separator using the posseld2 program (UVA flow cytometry core facility). A 20 &#x03BC;L aliquot of each output was used for bud scar counting using calcofluor white staining, before combining the isolated samples into a single microfuge tube. Samples were frozen at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C before protein extraction. Thawed cells were vortexed twice for 1 min in 20&#x0025; TCA (trichloroacetic acid) with &#x007E;100 &#x03BC;L of acid washed glass beads with a brief cooling period in between vortexing.

<title>ChIP Assays with old and young cells populations</title>
<p>Two 1.5 L cultures were used for each biological replicate sample.

Sorted cells were immediately crosslinked with 1&#x0025; formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, then transferred to screw cap microcentrifuge tubes and the pellets flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed and lysed in 600 &#x03BC;L FA140 Lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 1&#x0025; Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1&#x0025; SDS, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma) by shaking with acid-washed glass beads in a Mini-Bead beater (Biospec Products). Cell lysates were recovered and sonicated for 30 cycles of 30 sec &#x201C;on&#x201D; and 30 sec &#x201C;off&#x2019; in a Diagenode Bioruptor followed by centrifugation at 16,000 x g. A 1/10<sup>th</sup> supernatant volume input was taken for each sample and crosslinking reversed by incubating overnight at 65&#x00B0;C in 150 &#x03BC;L elution buffer (TE, 1&#x0025; SDS). The remaining supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation overnight at 4&#x00B0;C with 5 &#x03BC;g of primary antibody and 30 &#x03BC;L of protein G magnetic beads (Pierce), followed by washing 1x with FA-140 buffer, 2x with FA-500 buffer (FA-140 with 500 mM NaCl), and 2x with LiCl solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5&#x0025; NP-40, 0.5&#x0025; SDS, 1 mM EDTA). DNA was eluted twice with 75 &#x03BC;L of elution buffer in a 65&#x00B0;C water bath for 15 min.</p>
<p>The eluates were combined and crosslinking reversed. Input and ChIP DNA samples were purified by an Invitrogen PureLink&#x2122; PCR purification kit. Finally, ChIP DNA was quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to the input DNA signal. Young cells were collected from flow through out of the autoMACS cell sorter and then processed as described for the aged cells. For ChIP assays on unsorted populations, cells were grown to log phase in 100 mL YPD before formaldehyde cross-linking for 20 min at 30&#x00B0;C while shaking. Additionally, 2.5 mg of protein was used for the IP instead of the entire lysate, and the chromatin solution was sonicated for 50 cycles rather than 30.</p>

<p>Chromatin was prepared in a similar manner to old cell ChIP assays with the following exceptions. Cells were grown to log phase in 200 mL YPD and fixed for 20 min with 1&#x0025; formaldehyde. Lysate volumes were adjusted to 4 mL in FA-140 lysis buffer and sonicated 5 times with a Branson 250 Digital Sonifier for 30 sec at 70&#x0025; amplitude. Samples were cooled on ice for at least 1 min between sonication periods. The lysate was split into 3 microcentrifuge tubes and spun for 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a microfuge at 4&#x00B0;C. The entire supernatant from 1 tube was used for immunoprecipitation overnight with 15 &#x03BC;g of a-Myc 9E10 antibody and 30 &#x03BC;L of protein G magnetic beads (Pierce). After washing, elution, and reverse cross-linking, 100 mg of Proteinase K was added for 2 hr at 42&#x00B0;C. Chromatin was purified in a Zymogen DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit and quantified using a Qubit fluorometric device. A minimum of 20 ng of DNA was used as input for NEBNext&#x00AE; library construction. ML150 libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq and ML163 libraries on an Illumina Miseq by the UVA Genome Analysis and Technology Core.

<p>From 50 mL log phase SC cultures of strains 3349-1B, 3312-7A, and 3460-2A, 5&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> cells were washed and biotinylated as described in the Old Cell Isolation section. This population was transferred into a 1.5 L SC culture and allowed to grow for 12 hr. The original biotinylated population was then purified by incubation with 300 &#x03BC;L of streptavidin micro beads followed by gravity filtration through a Miltenyi LS column.
