<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis is a prevalent but neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic trematodes of the genus <italic>Schistosoma,</italic> with the primary disease-causing species being <italic>S. haematobium</italic>, <italic>S. mansoni,</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum.</italic> Male-female pairing of schistosomes is necessary for sexual maturity and the production of a large number of eggs, which are primarily responsible for schistosomiasis dissemination and pathology. Here, we used microarray hybridization, bioinformatics, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and gene silencing assays to identify genes that play critical roles in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> reproduction biology, particularly in vitellarium development, a process that affects male-female pairing, sexual maturation, and subsequent egg production. Microarray hybridization analyses generated a comprehensive set of genes differentially transcribed before and after male-female pairing. Although the transcript profiles of females were similar 16 and 18 days after host infection, marked gene expression changes were observed at 24 days. The 30 most abundantly transcribed genes on day 24 included those associated with vitellarium development. Among these, genes for female-specific 800 <italic>(fs800</italic>), <italic>eggshell precursor protein</italic>, and superoxide dismutase <italic>(cu-zn-SOD)</italic> were substantially upregulated. Our in situ hybridization results in female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> indicated that <italic>cu-zn-SOD</italic> mRNA was highest in the ovary and vitellarium, <italic>eggshell precursor protein</italic> mRNA was expressed in the ovary, ootype, and vitellarium, and <italic>Sjfs800</italic> mRNA was observed only in the vitellarium, localized in mature vitelline cells. Knocking down the <italic>Sjfs800</italic> gene in female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> by approximately 60&#x0025; reduced the number of mature vitelline cells, decreased rates of pairing and oviposition, and decreased the number of eggs produced in each male-female pairing by about 50&#x0025;. These results indicate that <italic>Sjfs800</italic> is essential for vitellarium development and egg production in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> and suggest that <italic>Sjfs800</italic> regulation may provide a novel approach for the prevention or treatment of schistosomiasis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis is a common but largely unstudied tropical disease caused by parasitic trematodes of the genus <italic>Schistosoma.</italic> The eggs of schistosomes are responsible for schistosomiasis transmission and pathology, and the production of these eggs is dependent on the pairing of females and males. In this study, we determined which genes in <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> females were differentially expressed before and after pairing with males, identifying the 30 most abundantly expressed of these genes. Among these 30 genes, we further characterized those in female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> that were upregulated after pairing and that were related to reproduction and vitellarium development, a process that affects male-female pairing, sexual maturation, and subsequent egg production. We identified three such genes, <italic>S. japonicum</italic> female-specific 800 <italic>(Sjfs800), eggshell precursor protein,</italic> and superoxide dismutase, and confirmed that the mRNAs for these genes were primarily localized in reproductive structures. By using gene silencing techniques to reduce the amount of <italic>Sjfs800</italic> mRNA in females by about 60&#x0025;, we determined that <italic>Sjfs800</italic> plays a key role in development of the vitellarium and egg production. This finding suggests that regulation of <italic>Sjfs800</italic> may provide a novel approach to reduce egg counts and thus aid in the prevention or treatment of schistosomiasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a tropical disease caused by parasitic trematodes of the genus <italic>Schistosoma.</italic> Although it is one of the most prevalent tropical infectious diseases, with more than 240 million people in 78 countries infected and approximately 800 million people at risk, schistosomiasis has been drastically understudied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The primary disease-causing species of <italic>Schistosoma</italic> are <italic>S. haematobium</italic>, <italic>S. mansoni,</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, the latter of which is distributed in China, Indonesia, and the Philippines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Disease burden assessments for schistosomiasis, based on the extent of end-organ damage and the associated morbidities related to malnutrition and chronic inflammation, indicate that the annual number of disability-adjusted life years lost is approximately 70 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Current control of schistosomiasis depends largely on a single drug, praziquantel; however, reliance on a single drug produces a precarious situation. Indeed, some studies have shown that isolates of schistosomes have reduced susceptibility to praziquantel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Thus, additional novel strategies are urgently needed to prevent and control schistosomiasis.</p>
<p><italic>S. japonicum</italic> has a complex developmental cycle that involves an aquatic snail as an intermediate host and a mammalian definitive host. In contrast to other trematode species, these parasites are unique in that males and females need to pair to continue development. Pairing of schistosome females and males promotes female reproductive system maturation and the production of eggs, which are a primary means of schistosomiasis transmission and immunopathological lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Maturation and maintenance of normal reproductive function in female <italic>S. mansoni</italic> require permanent pairing with the male. During pairing, germ cells in the reproductive organ differentiate into oocytes or vitellocytes, and some chemical or tactile stimulus exchange occurs between the male and female, leading to a cascade of changes during the pairing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, the effects on female reproductive system development and the molecular mechanisms underpinning male-female pairing have not been completely determined, leaving myriad questions that require further study.</p>
<p>Ongoing work in our laboratory has indicated that during the development of <italic>S. japonicum,</italic> no male-female pairing occurs up to 16 days after the host is infected. Some pairing occurs 17 days post infection (dpi), and pairing is common 18 dpi. Paired females begin laying eggs approximately 24 dpi. Therefore, in the present study, to identify genes that likely contribute to pairing and reproduction, we used microarray technology to determine differential gene expression in females 16, 18, and 24 dpi. We identified genes that play critical roles in the development of the vitellarium and in the production of eggs, providing a clearer understanding of gene regulation before and after male-female pairing in the <italic>S. japonicum</italic> female and insights on schistosome reproduction biology.</p>

<title>Animals and parasites</title>
<p>Freshly shed wild-type cercariae of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> were harvested from infected <italic>Oncomelania hupensis</italic> that were purchased from the Hunan Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Yueyang, China. Female Kunming mice (6-8 weeks old) and New Zealand rabbits (4 months old) were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Anhui Medical University. New Zealand rabbits and female Kunming mice were infected with 1000 or 50 cercariae, respectively, via the skin of the abdomen. After 16, 18, 24, 28, or 42 dpi the worms were washed out the hepatic portal vein using perfusion techniques. Male and female worms were manually separated. In order to collect <italic>S. japonicum</italic> eggs, liver tissues from rabbits 6 weeks post infection were homogenized and then subjected to consecutive fractional filtration. The filtrate was centrifuged. The supernatant and the tissue-containing layers were removed, leaving the egg-containing layer, which was diluted in 1.2&#x0025; saline and passed through a nylon net (300 mesh, i.e., 300 holes per inch). All parasite samples were soaked in RNAlater (Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific, USA) and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until they were used for total RNA extraction.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, amplification, and labeling</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN, &#x0023;74004, GmBH, Germany) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, and the overall RNA quality was assessed using denaturing gel electrophoresis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Total RNA was amplified and labeled using a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, one-color (Agilent Technologies, &#x0023;5190-2305), following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Labeled cRNA was purified using a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, &#x0023;74106).</p>

<title>Microarray construction and hybridization and subsequent data analysis</title>
<p>A schistosome genome-wide microarray was used for profiling gene expression in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> female 16, 18, and 24 dpi. Microarrays were printed on the Agilent custom Schistosoma 4 x 44K chip (design ID: 048766). There were eight specimens; thus, eight chips in total were needed. Each slide was hybridized with 1.65 &#x03BC;g of Cy3-labeled cRNA using a Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies, &#x0023;5188-5242) with a Hybridization Oven (Agilent Technologies, &#x0023;G2545A) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. After 17 hours of hybridization had elapsed, the slides were washed in staining dishes (Thermo Shandon, &#x0023;121, Waltham, MA, USA) with a Gene Expression Wash Buffer Kit (Agilent Technologies, &#x0023;5188-5327), following the manufacturers&#x2019; instructions. All of these aforementioned procedures were performed by Biotechnology Shanghai China. The slides were scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies, &#x0023;G2565CA) using the following default settings: dye channel, green; scan resolution, 5 &#x03BC;m; PhotoMultiplier Tube, 100&#x0025; and 10&#x0025;, 16 bit. Data were extracted with Feature &#x2019; Extraction software, version 10.7 (Agilent Technologies). Raw data were normalized using the Quantile algorithm, GeneSpring software, version 11.0 (Agilent Technologies). Outlier probes were identified, and their contribution was reduced at the reported gene expression level. The expression value of a gene was a weighted average of all forward or reverse probe sets when both background correction and quantile normalization were performed.</p>

<title>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title>
<p>Thirteen genes whose expression levels were increased and two genes whose expression levels were decreased in females after pairing relative to those levels before pairing were selected for validation using qPCR. Total RNA (500 ng) from the females was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using a PrimeScript RT &#x2019; Reagent Kit (TaKaRa &#x0026; Clontech, &#x0023;RR037A, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Each 10 &#x03BC;L of PCR reaction contained 10 &#x03BC;L of 2&#x002A; SYBR Premix Ex Taq II, 1 &#x03BC;L of cDNA, 1.6 &#x03BC;L of the forward and reverse primer pair, 0.4 &#x03BC;L of 50&#x002A; ROX Reference Dye, and 7 &#x03BC;L of sterile water. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95&#x00B0;C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95&#x00B0;C and 1 min annealing and extension at 60&#x00B0;C. A dissociation step (95&#x00B0;C for 15 s, 60&#x00B0;C for 1 min, and 95&#x00B0;C for 15 s) was performed to confirm the amplification specificity for each gene. A reliable reference gene for transcriptomic analysis of <italic>S. japonicum,</italic> proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 4 <italic>(PSMD4),</italic> was used as a control gene in the assays. The PCR primers were designed using Primer Premier 5 software (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). PCR reactions were performed in technical triplicates using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression level of each gene was analyzed using SDS 1.4 software (Applied Biosystems).</p>

<title>In situ hybridization</title>
<p>Riboprobes were synthesized according to previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Briefly, probes were synthesized from restriction enzyme&#x2013;digested DNA according to the orientation of the insert in pSPT18 using a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (SP6/T7) (Roche, &#x0023;111750251910, Germany) labeled with digoxigenin. For whole-mount in situ hybridization, trematodes were fixed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde for 45 min and dehydrated in methanol. Following being bleached in 6&#x0025; hydrogen peroxide in methanol to prevent tanning of the vitellaria, trematodes were permeabilized using proteinase k (TaKaRa &#x0026; Clontech, &#x0023;9034), incubated with prehybridization buffer (50&#x0025; deionized formamide, 5&#x00D7; saline sodium citrate, 1 mg/mL yeast RNA, 1&#x0025; Tween 20) for 2 h and then hybridized (prehybridization buffer with 10&#x0025; dextran sulfate) with a riboprobe at 56&#x00B0;C for 20 h. Excess riboprobe was removed by washing in 2&#x00D7; and 0.2&#x002A; saline sodium citrate, followed by blocking in blocking reagent (Roche, &#x0023;11175041910). The bound riboprobe was detected after incubation of trematodes in antidigoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Roche) diluted 1:5000 in blocking reagent overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. The unbound antibody was removed by washing in maleic acid buffer (100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1&#x0025; Tween 20 at pH 7.5) for 4 h in twelve changes of buffer. After being washed, specimens were incubated in detection buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl and 0.1 M NaCl at pH 9.5). Hybridization signals were detected by adding 200 &#x03BC;L of NBT/BCIP in detection buffer. After development, trematodes were washed in PBS then de-stained with 100&#x0025; ethanol. Trematodes were mounted in 80&#x0025; glycerol, and then microscopy and digital image capture were performed using an Olympus DP73 microscope.</p>

<title>RNA interference</title>
<p>The siRNAs (21 base pairs) were designed using the <italic>Sjfs800</italic> mRNA sequence (GenBank accession No., FN313803.1) with the Thermo Fisher website software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rnaidesigner.thermofisher.com">https://rnaidesigner.thermofisher.com</ext-link>) and chemically synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (China). Three siRNA sequences (siRNA1-3) that shared no homology with any other <italic>S. japonicum</italic> gene based on an online analysis with BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and the scrambled siRNA sequence are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The results of RNAi were tested using qPCR as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Briefly, Kunming mice were challenged percutaneously with 60-70 cercariae and were humanely killed 28 dpi. The worms were obtained by portal perfusion using RPMI 1640 medium at 37&#x00B0;C and were then incubated in 24-well plates (15 pairs/well) containing 1 mL of complete Basch medium, with half of the medium exchanged every day. The medium was supplemented with 10 KU/mL penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 250 &#x03BC;g/mL amphotericin B (Sangon Biotech, &#x0023;B13540732, China), and 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (Gibco, &#x0023;10091148, Thermo Scientific, USA). Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect worms with one of the three <italic>Sjfs800</italic>-specific siRNAs, at a final concentration of 100 nM, or RNAase-free water (mock, no siRNA). The gene-silencing effect of each siRNA was determined using qPCR at the end of a 72-h cultivation period. The worms were then transfected with either the siRNA that was found to be most efficient or with the scrambled siRNA (control). The transfected worms were cultivated for up to 10 days and transfected again with siRNA1 on the fourth and seventh days; half of the medium was exchanged every day. After 10 days, all the eggs in the medium were collected and counted using light microscopy. Adult male-female pairings were also observed and counted. The siRNA silencing effects and morphological changes were measured using qPCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP5, Germany), respectively.</p>

<title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy</title>
<p>The confocal laser scanning microscopy procedure has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. After 10 days of <italic>Sjfs800-specific</italic> siRNA1 treatment, the male-female paired couples were separated manually and fixed separately in a solution of 95&#x0025; alcohol, 3&#x0025; formaldehyde, and 2&#x0025; glacial acetic acid. The trematodes were then stained in 2.5&#x0025; hydrochloric carmine (Ourchem, &#x0023;71009382, China) for 16 h at 37&#x00B0;C and de-stained in 70&#x0025; acidic ethanol. After dehydration in an ethanol series for 1 min in each concentration, parasites were cleared for 1 min each in 50&#x0025; xylene diluted in ethanol and 100&#x0025; xylene, and then whole-mounted with neutral balsam (Sinopharm Chemical &#x0023;36645, China) on glass slides. The reproductive organ morphology of the trematodes was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy, with a 470-nm longpass filter and a 488-nm He/Ne laser under reflection mode.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>To determine the potential function of these upregulated genes, the Gene Ontology (GO) functional categories were assessed. In the biological process GO category, the genes involved in metabolic and biosynthetic processes were more active in females during and after pairing than before pairing, indicating that nutritional acquisition is more crucial for paired than unpaired female trematodes, which is likely a reflection of the oviposition status. In the molecular function GO category, the genes involved in hydrolase activity were more active in females during and after pairing than before pairing. In the cellular component GO category, gene products localized to membrane-bound organelles were more enriched in females after pairing than before or during pairing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Paired adult female schistosomes produce a large number of eggs, which are primarily responsible for the schistosomiasis disease pathology and are critical for dissemination of the disease. The reproductive system of female schistosomes has been widely studied at the molecular level, and several studies have described transcriptomes that are differentially expressed before and after pairing in female schistosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. For example, <italic>SmFst</italic> was recently identified as a regulatory molecule in the transforming growth factor &#x03B2; pathway that is pairing dependently transcribed in the male gonad, likely facilitating processes leading to male competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Lu et al. described pairing-induced processes within the gonads, including stem cell-associated and neural functions, by analyzing gonad-specific and pairing-dependent transcriptomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In 2017, Wang et al. mapped the dynamic transcriptome changes in male and female <italic>S. japonicum</italic> throughout the sexual developmental process from pairing to maturation to identify biogenic amines and insect-like hormones that regulate reproduction development in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, gene microarray analysis was used to screen for differently expressed genes before and after pairing of the <italic>S. japonicum</italic> female. We found the transcript profiles in 16-dpi females were similar to those at 18 dpi. However, substantial changes in gene expression were observed in 24-dpi females, indicating that virgin female schistosomes undergo marked changes in gene expression before they complete maturation. Genes involved in reproduction, such as those associated with the cell cycle, egg formation, and protein synthesis, were substantially upregulated in the adult female trematodes. This result is consistent with that of others and on the basis of gender-related gene expression patterns reflects that the female, rather than the male, governs egg production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The results of our gene microarray analyses showed that the top 30 genes with respect to transcript abundance in 24-dpi females included representatives with proven roles in vitellarium development and egg production, including <italic>eggshell precursor protein</italic>, superoxide dismutase <italic>(SOD),</italic> and <italic>Sjfs800.</italic> The vitellarium, which occupies the posterior two-thirds of the female schistosome body, produces vitellocytes. Vitellocytes supply nutrition to the developing zygote and constituents essential to egg shell construction. Mature vitellocytes join with fertilized oocytes in the ootype, which is where mature eggs are formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Thus, the development of the vitellarium plays essential roles in the production of schistosome eggs. In the present study, we aimed to determine the role of some of the genes related to vitellarium development in the production of schistosome eggs.</p>
<p>SOD is an antioxidant that removes reactive oxygen species in an organism by converting the superoxide radical to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD is in the cytoplasm and mitochondria and is also extracellular and is conserved across various species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>SOD in</italic> 24-dpi <italic>S. japonicum</italic> females was located primarily in the ovary and vitellarium. Our transcriptome analysis indicated that <italic>SOD</italic> was expressed almost exclusively (&#x003E;2000-fold enriched) and at high levels in 24-dpi (rather than in 16-dpi or 18-dpi) adult female trematodes, which may be under significant oxidative stress because of vitellarium development and egg production.</p>
<p>The schistosome eggshell is a hardened and tanned structure made from cross-linked proteins. Eggshell formation starts in the ootype. Contractions of the ootype cause the vitelline cells to release their granules, which contain eggshell precursor proteins. The eggshell is shaped by the ootype and strengthened through tyrosinase activity that causes cross-linking of the released eggshell precursor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. We found that the <italic>eggshell precursor protein</italic> gene was far more highly expressed in 24-dpi adult female trematodes than in 16-dpi or 18-dpi females. Transcripts of the <italic>eggshell precursor protein</italic> gene were expressed within the ovary and vitellarium, consistent with the findings of a previous study showing similar gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. We also observed <italic>eggshell precursor protein</italic> signals in the ootype. Thus, the findings of the present study suggest that eggshell precursor protein maybe play an important role in helping the vitellarium promote eggshell formation.</p>
<p><italic>Smfs800</italic> gene was first found and identified by Reis et al., who also used in situ hybridization to determine that <italic>Smfs800</italic> mRNA was expressed only in female vitelline cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], suggesting that Smfs800 may play role in egg development. However, little is known about the functions of fs800 in vitellarium development and egg production. In the present study, <italic>Sjfs800</italic> mRNA was located in mature vitelline cells. Some developmental defects, especially a reduced number of mature vitelline cells in the vitellarium, were observed after <italic>Sjfs800</italic> gene knockdown by siRNA, and the pairing rate and oviposition rate were also significantly decreased. Therefore, we concluded that fs800 is vital for vitelline cell development and maturation and that maturation of the vitellarium is required for <italic>S. japonicum</italic> females to produce eggs. The number male-female pairings was reduced by approximately 70&#x0025; after <italic>Sjfs800</italic> siRNA transfection. The results of some studies have indicated that <italic>Sjfs800</italic> may be a molecule downstream of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> Nanos1 or Abl tyrosine kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study showed substantial differences in the expression levels of some genes in the <italic>S. japonicum</italic> female before and after male-female pairing, including genes related to vitellarium development, which can affect pairing, sexual maturation, and egg production. These results provide a deeper understanding of the reproductive biology of schistosomes and may lead to the development of novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis.</p>
