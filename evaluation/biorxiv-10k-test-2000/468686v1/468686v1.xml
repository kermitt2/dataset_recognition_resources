<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Activation of the muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> receptor is a promising approach to improve cognitive deficits associated with cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and schizophrenia. TAK-071 is an M<sub>1</sub>-selective positive allosteric modulator that improves cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, with reduced side effects on gastrointestinal function in rats. In this study, we explored changes in quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) power bands, with or without scopolamine challenge, as a non-invasive translational biomarker for the effect of TAK-071 in cynomolgus monkeys. Scopolamine has been reported to increase theta and delta power bands and decrease alpha power band in healthy volunteers. In line with the clinical observations, scopolamine (25&#x2013;100 &#x00B5;g/kg, subcutaneous administration [s.c.]) increased theta and delta power bands in cynomolgus monkeys in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had the opposite effect on alpha power band. The effects of TAK-071 on scopolamine (25 &#x00B5;g/kg, s.c.)-induced qEEG spectral changes were examined using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and a muscarinic M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist xanomeline as comparative cholinomimetics. TAK-071 (0.3&#x2013;3 mg/kg, oral administration [p.o.]), donepezil (3 mg/kg, p.o.), and xanomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) suppressed the scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands. These results suggest that changes in specific qEEG power bands, in particular theta and delta power bands in the context of scopolamine challenge, could be used as translational biomarkers for the evaluation of TAK-071 in clinical studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders that profoundly impact cognitive function. A substantial amount of evidence has established that degeneration of cholinergic neurons contributes to cognitive deterioration in patients with AD and DLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The effects of currently available cholinergic treatments are mediated by increasing the synaptic acetylcholine (ACh) concentration through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to symptomatic cognitive improvement. However, these treatments have limited efficacy in part because of severe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. One approach to selectively restore cholinergic function in the brain and enhance cognitive function is direct activation of the neuronal muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> receptor (M<sub>1</sub>R), as several lines of evidence have demonstrated that M<sub>1</sub>R is highly expressed in the brain regions associated with cognition, and its activators are expected to improve cognitive deficits in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. However, the development of subtype-selective drugs that bind to the orthosteric site of M<sub>1</sub>R remains challenging because of high conservation across the muscarinic receptor subfamily. To achieve high selectivity against M<sub>1</sub>R, we focused on the development of an M<sub>1</sub> positive allosteric modulator (PAM). In our previous study, we reported that even highly selective M<sub>1</sub> PAMs caused diarrhea in mice through M<sub>1</sub>R activation and that an ileum contractile response upon treatment with M<sub>1</sub> PAMs was positively correlated with their &#x03B1;-values, indices of binding cooperativity between ACh and M<sub>1</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, M<sub>1</sub> PAMs with low &#x03B1;-values caused less diarrhea side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Based on this report, we sought M<sub>1</sub> PAMs with lower &#x03B1;-values, and identified TAK-071 (4-fluoro-2-[(3<italic>S</italic>,4<italic>S</italic>)-4-hydroxytetrahydro-2<italic>H</italic>-pyran-3-yl]-5-methyl-6-[4-(1<italic>H</italic>-pyrazol-1-yl)benzyl]-2,3-dihydro-1<italic>H</italic>-isoindol-1-one) with sufficient cognitive efficacy and milder GI side effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy with AChE inhibitors such as donepezil and rivastigmine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The main goals of early-phase drug development are demonstration of substantial target engagement at doses that are safe and tolerable and determination of a therapeutic dose range. To facilitate drug development, translational research requires minimally invasive and quantifiable biomarkers that can be obtained in both preclinical and clinical studies. Positron emission tomography (PET) is commonly used for drug development of the central nervous system (CNS) as it allows assessment of ligand-target binding and its distribution in the brain. The use of PET imaging is limited by the requirement for a well-characterized PET radioligand suitable for demonstration of target engagement. Recently, direct radiolabeling of a selective M<sub>1</sub>R allosteric agonist, GSK1034702, was performed and PET measurements revealed good brain uptake of this agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. However, regardless of good brain penetration, it has not been clarified that the radioligand specifically binds to an allosteric site of M<sub>1</sub>R. Furthermore, although PET studies can evaluate drug-receptor interactions in terms of target occupancy, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects are not measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed to demonstrate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships and thereby provide evidence for functional modulation of the pharmacological target of TAK-071.</p>
<p>Following the first observations by Berger of abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) sequences in patients with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], there have been many studies on quantitative EEG (qEEG) in patients with AD. The hallmarks of qEEG abnormalities in patients with AD and DLB is slowing of rhythms in specific brain regions, characterized by increases in theta and delta activities and decreases in alpha and beta activities under relaxed sitting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Correlation between the degree of the qEEG abnormality and cognitive impairment have been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that donepezil significantly decreased delta activity and increased alpha and beta activities in patients with AD, suggesting normalization of the qEEG abnormalities in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In healthy subjects, scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, commonly used for pharmacological modeling of the cholinergic deficit in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], caused concomitant appearance of transient cognitive impairments and qEEG spectral changes that resemble those observed in patients with AD and DLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. After scopolamine treatment, qEEG resting state studies revealed an increase in delta power band and decrease in alpha power band. Moreover, AChE inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and tacrine decreased delta power band after treatment with scopolamine in freely moving rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated whether qEEG analysis could function as a PD translational biomarker for TAK-071 efficacy assessment in non-human primates. To determine the utility of qEEG analysis, we examined whether the effects of scopolamine on changes in qEEG spectra in monkeys were similar to those in healthy subjects or in patients with AD and DLB. In addition, we evaluated the effects of cholinergic drugs such as donepezil, xanomeline, and TAK-071 on scopolamine-induced qEEG spectral changes. Our results provide evidence that qEEG analysis under the scopolamine challenge paradigm might be a valuable translational biomarker for the evaluation of TAK-071 in clinical trials.</p>

<title>Measurements</title>
<p>After at least a 1-month recovery period in their home cages, the monkeys were habituated to the recording chamber (acrylic cage, 60 &#x00D7; 55 &#x00D7; 75 [cm<sup>3</sup> width &#x00D7; depth &#x00D7; height]) located in a soundproof, electrically shielded room. Cortical EEG, EMG, and EOG signals were recorded at a sampling rate of 500 Hz using Dataquest ART software (Data Sciences International, New Brighton, MN). The behavioral and postural changes of the animals were observed using a video camera continuously throughout the experiment. The recordings were performed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m..</p>
<p>EEG data were analyzed off-line using SleepSign (KISSEI COMTEC Co., Ltd., Nagano, Japan). Digitized EEG signals were high-pass filtered with a 0.75-Hz filter. Spectral power densities for each frequency band were calculated by fast Fourier transform in consecutive 10-s epochs. Epochs containing abnormal EEG, defined by excessive amplitude (&#x003E; 500 &#x00B5;V), were omitted from data analysis. For analysis of temporal changes in a specific spectral band (1&#x2013;4 Hz for delta, 4&#x2013;8 Hz for theta, 8&#x2013;12 Hz for alpha, 12&#x2013;30 Hz for beta, 30&#x2013;80 Hz for gamma), the EEG power of each spectral band was calculated every 15 min. For each animal, the qEEG spectral analyses were performed from 30 to 240 min after treatment because oral and subcutaneous administration of drugs to monkeys can affect the qEEG power spectra. Data obtained in the post-drug period were normalized with those obtained in the baseline period and were calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) between 30 and 210 min after drug administration for quantitative analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Scopolamine increased alpha, theta, and delta power bands, in a dose-dependent manner</title>
<p>In clinical trials, multiple lines of evidence have suggested that scopolamine treatment induces qEEG power spectral changes, particularly increases in theta and delta power bands and decrease in alpha power band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Initially, we examined the effects of scopolamine in qEEG power spectra in cynomolgus monkeys. To evaluate dose-dependency, scopolamine was subcutaneously administered at 25, 50, or 100 &#x00B5;g/kg to monkeys. Indeed, scopolamine increased alpha, theta, and delta power bands in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A&#x2013;C</xref>). These effects in all power bands persisted for 240 min after treatment, and peak increases were observed between 60 and 90 min after treatment. The time-dependent changes of each qEEG spectrum during scopolamine treatment relatively corresponded to its PK profile (S1 Fig and S1 Table). Alpha, theta, and delta power bands were significantly increased at 50 and 100 &#x00B5;g/kg doses (<italic>P</italic> &#x2264; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A&#x2013;C</xref>). In contrast, beta and gamma power bands did not change remarkably in the dose range of 25&#x2013;100 &#x00B5;g/kg of scopolamine (S2 Fig). It is reported that scopolamine at 20&#x2013;50 &#x00B5;g/kg moderately caused cognitive impairment in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Therefore, the dose of 25 &#x003D; &#x00B5;g/kg scopolamine was selected for further examinations.</p>

<title>Donepezil, an AChE inhibitor, suppressed the scopolamine-induced qEEG spectral changes</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the scopolamine-induced qEEG spectral changes in monkeys would be counteracted by an AChE inhibitor donepezil through enhancement of ACh concentration in the synaptic cleft. Donepezil (3 mg/kg, p.o.) and scopolamine (25 &#x00B5;g/kg, s.c.) were simultaneously administered to monkeys. The dose of donepezil for this study was determined based on the previous report, which showed that oral treatment of donepezil at 1&#x2013;3 mg/kg significantly attenuated the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The increases in alpha and theta power bands induced by scopolamine treatment tended to be attenuated by donepezil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">B</xref>). Furthermore, in accordance with the previous report in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], donepezil significantly suppressed the scopolamine-induced increase in the delta power band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). These effects were observed between 60 and 240 min after drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A&#x2013;C</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we examined the effects of donepezil on qEEG power spectra. Oral treatment of donepezil at 0.3 mg/kg alone increased alpha power band, whereas the dose-dependency was not observed (S3 Fig A). Donepezil (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) did not affect theta and delta power bands (S3 Fig B and C).</p>

<title>Xanomeline, an orthosteric M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>4</sub>R agonist, tended to attenuate the scopolamine-induced increases in qEEG power bands</title>
<p>Donepezil non-selectively activates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors by increasing ACh levels in the synaptic clefts, thus, we next assessed the relative contribution of muscarinic receptors, especially M<sub>1</sub>R and M<sub>4</sub>R, to the effects of donepezil on scopolamine-induced qEEG power spectral changes, using an orthosteric M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>4</sub>R agonist, xanomeline. The dose of xanomeline was determined based on the previous report, which demonstrated that subcutaneous treatment of xanomeline at 1 mg/kg exhibited antipsychotic-like activity without inducing sedative effects in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Simultaneous administration of xanomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and scopolamine (25 &#x00B5;g/kg, s.c.) showed a trend to suppress the effects of scopolamine on qEEG power spectral changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A&#x2013;C</xref>). The scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands were continuously inhibited between 60 and 240 min after treatment, although these effects were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A&#x2013;C</xref>). Thus, M<sub>1</sub>R and/or M<sub>4</sub>R antagonism may contribute to the qEEG power spectral changes caused by scopolamine treatment.</p>

<title>TAK-071 inhibited the scopolamine-induced qEEG spectral changes in a dose-dependent manner</title>
<p>Based on the results of donepezil and xanomeline in combination with scopolamine, it was hypothesized that the scopolamine-induced qEEG power spectral changes may be useful translational biomarkers for the evaluation of TAK-071 effectiveness. Thus, we investigated whether TAK-071 affected the qEEG power spectral changes caused by scopolamine treatment. We previously reported that TAK-071 at 0.3 mg/kg significantly ameliorated the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits, with a maximum plasma comcentration of 232 ng/mL in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Based on the PK profile of TAK-071 in monkeys (S2 Table), the doses of TAK-071 were selected at 0.3&#x2013;3 mg/kg to cover the effective plasma concentration in rats. Monkeys were simultaneously administered TAK-071 (0.3&#x2013;3 mg/kg, p.o.) and scopolamine (25 &#x00B5;g/kg, s.c.). TAK-071 at 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the scopolamine-induced increase in alpha power band, whereas at 3 mg/kg, TAK-071 significantly suppressed the increases in both alpha and theta power bands (<italic>P</italic> &#x2264; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>). Although there was no significant effect on delta power band, a decreasing trend was observed when TAK-071 was administered at 1 and 3 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>). Remarkably, these effects lasted between 90 and 240 min after drug administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A&#x2013;C</xref>).</p>

<p>Scopolamine (25 &#x00B5;g/kg, s.c.) and TAK-071 (0.3&#x2013;3 mg/kg, p.o.) were simultaneously administered to cynomolgus monkeys. After treatment with drugs or vehicle, (A) alpha, (B) theta, and (C) delta power bands of qEEG spectra were measured from 30 to 240 min. Results represent mean &#x00B1; SEM of AUC between 30 and 210 min after treatment for 3&#x2013;4 monkeys in each group. <sup>&#x002A;</sup><italic>P</italic> &#x2264; 0.05 versus vehicle-treated group by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. <sup>&#x0023;</sup><italic>P</italic> &#x2264; 0.05 versus scopolamine-treated group by paired <italic>t</italic>-test.

<p>In addition to the scopolamine challenge paradigm, the effects of TAK-071 alone on qEEG power spectra were evaluated. Oral treatment of TAK-071 significantly decreased alpha and theta power bands at 1 and 3 mg/kg and at 1 mg/kg, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x2264; 0.05, S4 Fig A and B). In contrast, TAK-071 (0.3&#x2013;3 mg/kg) did not change delta power band (S4 Fig C).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To improve the success rates in CNS drug development, appropriate translational biomarkers from preclinical to clinical stages are required. Neuroimaging techniques and qEEG measures are now being used to provide evidence of drug penetration into the CNS and determine the PK/PD properties of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Typical EEG abnormalities in patients with AD and DLB are associated with a decrease in alpha power band, which leads to increases in theta and delta power activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Several reports have demonstrated that scopolamine caused changes in qEEG power spectra in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], which in part corresponded to those in patients with AD and DLB. Therefore, it is considered that the scopolamine model could reflect some aspects of the cholinergic deficit in AD and DLB in both PD and cognition. In addition to the findings from clinical studies, a scopolamine-induced increase in delta power band was also detected in freely moving rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In line with the findings of clinical and preclinical studies, in this study we showed that scopolamine caused qEEG spectral changes in a dose-dependent manner, in particular, increases in theta and delta power bands in monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). We selected cynomolgus monkeys, not rodents, because monkey brains more closely resemble human brains than do rodents. Furthermore, monkeys are diurnal animals, and we considered it essential that the studies be performed under the same conditions as clinical studies, i.e., during daytime.</p>
<p>Among the scopolamine-induced changes in qEEG power spectra, the increases in theta and delta power bands in monkeys were similar to those reported in humans. Therefore, at least the effects of cholinergic agents in these power bands could be useful as translational biomarkers in the scopolamine challenge paradigm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the increase in alpha power band in monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>) was opposite to the results in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. It is known that alpha activity of the EEG power spectra is enhanced during an eyes-closed resting period and suppressed by visual stimulation in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In clinical studies, subjects were instructed to remain awake and move as little as possible while keeping their eyes closed during qEEG measurements, so that the alpha power band would be increased under the measurement conditions. In contrast, the condition of the monkeys&#x2019; eyes during the qEEG measurements were uncontrollable. Monkeys used in our study would open their eyes because the experiments were conducted during the diurnal period under arousal conditions. This discrepancy might have led to the opposite effect on the alpha power band.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>, the time-dependent change of each qEEG spectrum during scopolamine treatment was relatively consistent with its PK profile (S1 Fig and S1 Table). Therefore, the current study suggests that the PK/PD relationship of scopolamine was detected in monkeys.</p>
<p>In line with the previous studies that reported significant suppression of the scopolamine-induced increase in delta power band by AChE inhibitors in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], this study also demonstrated that donepezil counteracted the scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, both xanomeline and TAK-071 showed the potential to inhibit the scopolamine-induced qEEG spectral changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands were suppressed partly through M<sub>1</sub>R activation in monkeys. In addition to the scopolamine challenge paradigm, we examined the effects of donepezil (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) and TAK-071 (0.3&#x2013;3 mg/kg) on qEEG power spectra, and found that TAK-071 treatment alone slightly decreased alpha and theta power bands, whereas donepezil treatment alone did not decrease the qEEG power spectra (S3 and S4 Figs). Similar results were reported by Uslaner, where MK-7622, a selective M<sub>1</sub> PAM, showed reductions of alpha and theta power bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. The discrepancy between TAK-071 and donepezil may be explained by selective M<sub>1</sub>R signal transduction. In our previous study, TAK-071 was demonstrated to be a highly selective M<sub>1</sub> PAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In contrast, donepezil indirectly and non-selectively activates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors by increasing ACh levels in the synaptic clefts, which might lead to a masking effect on the decrease in qEEG power spectra through M<sub>1</sub>R activation. In fact, another AChE inhibitor, galantamine, did not change theta power band in healthy young volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we did not examine the direct association between qEEG spectral changes and cognitive deficits by scopolamine treatment in monkeys. Thus, it would be difficult to predict the effective dose of TAK-071 for cognitive improvements from the qEEG results in monkeys because the relationship between the effective doses at which cognitive improvement is observed and the induction of qEEG spectral changes remains unclear. However, both oral administration of 3 mg/kg donepezil and intramuscular administration of 0.1 mg/kg xanomeline improved scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, it is considered that qEEG abnormalities are correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in AD and DLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. While no direct comparisons were made in this study, inferences might be drawn about the effects on qEEG power spectra and cognition in monkeys. Hence, scopolamine-induced qEEG spectral changes may also be useful as a translational biomarker in humans for evaluation of procognitive effects of TAK-071.</p>
