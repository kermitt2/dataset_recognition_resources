<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Condensins are genome organisers that shape chromosomes and promote their accurate transmission. Several studies have also implicated condensins in gene expression, although the mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Here, we report on the role of condensin in gene expression in fission and budding yeasts. In contrast to previous studies, we provide compelling evidence that condensin plays no direct role in the maintenance of the transcriptome, neither during interphase nor during mitosis. We further show that the changes in gene expression in post-mitotic fission yeast cells that result from condensin inactivation are largely a consequence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase, which notably depletes the RNA-exosome from daughter cells. Crucially, preventing karyotype abnormalities in daughter cells restores a normal transcriptome despite condensin inactivation. Thus, chromosome instability, rather than a direct role of condensin in the transcription process, changes gene expression. This knowledge challenges the concept of gene regulation by canonical condensin complexes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes are ring-shaped ATPases, conserved from bacteria to human, which shape chromosomes and ensure their accurate transmission during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). Eukaryotes possess three distinct SMC protein complexes, named condensins, cohesin and SMC5/6. Condensins structure and condense chromosomes, cohesin ensures sister-chromatid cohesion and organises topological domains in the genome during interphase, and SMC5/6 promotes proper DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). A large body of in vivo and in vitro studies has substantiated the idea that SMC complexes shape the genome and preserve its integrity by encircling DNA helixes and, at least partly, by extruding loops of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). Besides organising chromosomes, cohesin and condensins have also been widely implicated in the control of gene expression, raising the idea that the two complexes link gene expression to chromosome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dowen and Young, 2014</xref>). Yet, while our understanding of gene regulation by cohesin has progressed during the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>), the mechanisms through which condensins impact on gene expression have remained largely enigmatic.</p>
<p>Condensins have been best characterised as the key drivers of the assembly of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Robellet et al., 2017</xref>). The profound reorganisation of chromatin fibres into compact and individualised rod-shaped chromosomes, that marks the entry into mitosis, is essential for the accurate transmission of the genome during anaphase. When condensins are impaired, sister-centromeres migrate towards the opposite pole of the mitotic spindle upon anaphase onset, but chromosome arms remain entangled and hence fail to separate, leading to the formation of sustained anaphase chromatin bridges and DNA breakage in telophase and in post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cuylen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hyun-Soo Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Samoshkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sutani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Toselli-Mollereau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Like all SMC complexes, condensins are made of two ATPases, called SMC2<sup>Cut14</sup> and SMC4<sup>Cut3</sup> (fission yeast names are indicated in superscript), associated with three non-SMC subunits that regulate the ATPase activity of the holocomplex and govern its association with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kschonsak et al., 2017</xref>). Most eukaryotes possess two condensins, called condensin I and II, which are composed of a same SMC2/SMC4 heterodimer but are associated with two different sets of regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Robellet et al., 2017</xref>). Despite their structural and functional similarities, the dynamics of association of condensin I and II with chromosomes differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). Condensin II is nuclear during interphase and enriched on chromosomes from prophase until telophase. Condensin I, in contrast, is mostly cytoplasmic during interphase and associates with chromosomes from prometaphase until telophase. A third condensin variant called the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) has been described in the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which associates with the two X chromosomes in hermaphrodite animals and halves the expression of X-linked genes by reducing the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kruesi et al., 2013</xref>). Yeasts, in contrast, possess a unique condensin complex, similar in term of primary sequence to condensin I.</p>
<p>Condensin I and II have been implicated in the control of gene expression in various organisms, ranging from yeasts to human. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the silencing of heterochromatic mating type genes and the position effect exerted by repetitive ribosomal DNA are both alleviated when condensin is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bhalla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the SMC4<sup>Cut3</sup> subunit of condensin is needed to repress tRNAs genes as well as reporter genes inserted into the pericentric DNA repeats that are coated with heterochomatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>). It remains unclear, however, in which cell cycle phase and through which mechanism budding and fission yeast condensins regulate the expression of such diverse genes in such different genomic contexts. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, depletion of condensin II is linked to an increase in the expression of at least 250 genes, but this effect does not correlate with the occupancy of condensin II on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, condensin I has been implicated in the repression of homeotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lupo et al., 2001</xref>), whereas condensin II has been reported to take part in the production of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>). Murine peripheral T cells that express a mutant version of the condensin II CAP-H2 regulatory subunit, exhibit a decreased compaction of chromatin and an increased expression of the proliferative gene <italic>Cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a possible mechanistic relationship between condensin-mediated chromosome organisation and gene expression. However, another study reported that the same CAP-H2 mutation led to only subtle effects on the transcriptome of precursor thymocytes, which might be caused by chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps more consistent with a direct role, condensin I was found associated with active promoters during M phase in chicken DT40 cells, and its depletion prior to mitotic entry coincided with a decreased expression during the subsequent G1 phase of a subset of genes to which it was bound to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, cohesin and condensin II have been detected at super-enhancers in rapidly proliferating mouse embryonic stem cells, and depleting condensin II has been associated with a reduced expression of cell-identity genes driven by these super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dowen et al., 2013</xref>). Yuen et al. observed a similar effect on the expression of highly-expressed housekeeping genes in mouse embryonic stem cells and human embryonic kidney cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yuen et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, it has been reported that not only condensin II, but also condensin I, binds enhancers activated by &#x03B2;-estradiol during interphase in human MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, and that the depletion of condensin I or II led to a reduced transcription of oestrogen-activated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, the same enhancers where also found occupied by cohesin and to rely upon this complex to drive gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>All these studies tend to support the idea that condensin I and II play an important and evolutionarily-conserved role in gene expression, through which they impinge on cell identity, cell proliferation and, possibly, also immunity. Yet, no conclusive evidence has been provided thus far as to how condensin I and II might achieve this function. Mitotic chromosomes conserve considerable chromatin accessibility, similar to interphase chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hihara et al., 2012</xref>), and DNA remains accessible to transcription factors even in mitotic chromosomes that have been structured by condensin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear whether and how mechanisms related to chromosome condensation could possibly underlie condensin-mediated gene regulation. Furthermore, given that the loss or gain of chromosomes is sufficient to alter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>), it is crucial to determine to which extent the role attributed to condensin I and II in the control of gene expression is mechanistically different from, or related to, the assembly and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.</p>
<p>Gene expression can be controlled at the transcriptional level, by changing the activity and/or the occupancy of RNA polymerases, as exemplified by condensin<sup>DCC</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kruesi et al., 2013</xref>). It can also be controlled at the co-or post-transcriptional level by modulating the half-life of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>). The RNA-exosome is a conserved ribonuclease complex that ensures the maturation and the controlled degradation of a plethora of RNAs in the cell, including, for example, defective RNAs or cryptic unstable non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>). The RNA-exosome consists of nine core subunits associated with the RNase Dis3 in the cytoplasm plus a second RNase, called Rrp6, in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms behind target recognition and processing or degradation modes selection by the RNA-exosome are not fully understood. Cofactors, such as the TRAMP poly(A)polymerase complex, stimulate the RNase activity of the RNA-exosome and specify its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>). Rrp6 has been found associated with chromosomes at actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrulis et al., 2002</xref>), leading to the idea that the RNA-exosome can handle nuclear RNA in a co-transcriptional manner. By processing and eliminating cellular transcripts, the RNA-exosome plays a central role in proper gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain insights into how canonical condensins regulate genes, we investigated the role of condensin complexes in gene expression during the cell cycle, in fission and budding yeasts. In contrast with previous studies, we present here converging evidence that condensin plays no major direct role in the control of gene expression, neither in <italic>S. pombe</italic> nor in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We show that lack of condensin is associated with increased levels of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs in post-mitotic fission yeast cells, reminiscent of other organisms, but that this effect is indirect: RNAs accumulate in condensin mutant cells because the missegregation of the rDNA during anaphase dampens RNA degradation by the nucleolar RNA-exosome in post-mitotic cells. The discovery that budding and fission yeast condensins contribute to proper gene expression by maintaining chromosome stability during cell divisions, and not through a direct impact on gene transcription, challenges the widespread idea that condensin I and condensin II are direct regulators of gene expression.</p>

<title>RNA-exosome-sensitive transcripts accumulate when condensin is impaired in fission yeast</title>
<p>To assess the role of condensin in gene expression in fission yeast, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type and mutant cells in which the SMC2<sup>Cut14</sup> ATPase subunit of condensin was inactivated by the thermosensitive <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saka et al., 1994</xref>). Cells growing asynchronously at permissive temperature were shifted to the restrictive temperature of 36&#x00B0;C for 2.5 hours (one cell doubling) to inactivate SMC2<sup>Cut14</sup> and their transcriptomes determined using strand-specific RNA-seq. We identified 306 transcripts that were differentially expressed by log2 fold changes superior to 0.5 or inferior to &#x2212;0.5 (p value &#x2264; 0.05) in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The vast majority (98.5&#x0025;; n=302/306) exhibited an increased steady-state level in the mutant. We confirmed the increase for six example RNAs by RT-qPCR, using either <italic>act1 or nda2</italic> mRNA levels as internal controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Thus, gene expression is altered, and mainly increased, in dividing condensin mutant <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells.</p>

<p>Of the 306 misregulated transcripts, 57&#x0025; were mRNAs and the remaining 43&#x0025; were non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We found histone mRNAs amongst the upregulated transcripts, confirming previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). However, the analysis of all increased mRNAs revealed no enrichment for a specific gene ontology (GO) term, which suggests that condensin does not regulate the expression a particular family of protein-coding genes. In contrast, ncRNAs, which represent 22&#x0025; of the transcription units in the fission yeast genome (n = 1522/6948), were significantly enriched in the population of transcripts up-regulated in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant (p&#x003C;0.001, Chi-square test). Since most ncRNAs are maintained at a low level by the nuclear RNA-exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wilhelm et al., 2008</xref>), their controlled degradation might be compromised in the mutant. We tested this hypothesis by Northern blotting using the antisense ncRNA <italic>mug93-antisense-1</italic> (<italic>mug93as</italic>) as a representative example. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>mug93as</italic> was barely detectable in a wild-type background but accumulated in cells lacking Rrp6 or defective for Dis3, as expected if it were degraded by the RNA-exosome. Remarkably, <italic>mug93as</italic> also accumulated in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, reaching levels reminiscent of the <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> control. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against RNA Pol II revealed no change in RNA Pol II occupancy at neither the <italic>mug93as</italic> gene, nor two additional example ncRNA genes (<italic>ncRNA.489</italic> and <italic>ncRNA.540</italic>), in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), although their ncRNA levels were increased between 5 and 30-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>). These RNAs might therefore accumulate due to impaired degradation rather than increased transcription. Taken together, these results indicate that unstable RNA species accumulate when condensin is defective.</p>
<p>To clearly delineate the number of transcripts targeted by the RNA-exosome that accumulate in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant, we compared the transcriptomes of <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> cells that had been grown in parallel and processed simultaneously for strand-specific RNA-seq analyses. We identified 663 RNAs that were differentially expressed by log2 fold changes superior to 0.5 or inferior to &#x2212;0.5 (p value &#x2264; 0.05) in the <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Of these differentially expressed RNAs, 78&#x0025; were increased in levels and 22&#x0025; were decreased. The population of Rrp6-sensitive RNAs was considerably enriched in ncRNAs (p&#x003C;0.001, Chi-square test) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Pairwise comparison with <italic>cut14-208</italic> revealed that 41&#x0025; of the RNAs that accumulated in the condensin mutant also accumulated in cells lacking Rrp6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-H</xref>), with no clear preference for ncRNA and mRNA transcripts (50&#x0025; each). A hypergeometric test confirmed that this overlap was statistically highly significant (p = 4.6e<sup>&#x2212;55</sup>). These data indicate that a large fraction of the transcripts that accumulate when condensin is impaired are normally targeted by the ribonuclease Rrp6.</p>

<title>Read-through transcripts accumulate upon condensin inactivation</title>
<p>Visual inspection of the RNA-seq profile of the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant revealed a widespread increase of reads downstream of the 3&#x2019; ends of genes, suggesting defects in the termination of transcription (for an example, see the <italic>hsp9</italic> gene in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Read-through transcripts are abnormal RNAs that are extended at their 3&#x2019; ends when RNA polymerases transcribe over Transcription Termination Sites (TTS) into downstream DNA sequences. Dis3 and Rrp6 have been reported to prevent the accumulation of read-through transcripts, although through possibly different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lemay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zofall et al., 2009</xref>). Lemay et al. have shown that 3&#x2019;-extended <italic>hsp9</italic> RNA accumulate in fission yeast cells when Dis3 is impaired, and to a lesser extend when Rrp6 is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lemay et al., 2014</xref>). By using RNase-H digestion of the 5&#x2019; end of <italic>hps9</italic> mRNA and northern blotting, we confirmed the accumulation of 3&#x2019;-extended <italic>hsp9</italic> RNA in <italic>dis3</italic> and <italic>rrp6</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells accumulated 3&#x2019;-extended <italic>hsp9</italic> RNA of the same length as cells depleted of Dis3 or Rrp6. Moreover, other condensin mutants, such as <italic>cut3-477</italic> and <italic>cut14-180</italic>, also accumulated read-through <italic>hsp9</italic> RNA (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>), which demonstrates that the accumulation of uncleaved, 3&#x2019;-extended <italic>hsp9</italic> transcripts is a feature of condensin inactivation.</p>

<p>To determine the prevalence of read-through RNAs in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, we systematically searched and quantified stretches of consecutive RNA-seq reads that mapped immediately downstream the TTS of annotated genes on the same DNA strand and did not overlap with downstream genes (see Material and Methods). Using these criteria, we identified 489 transcripts, mostly mRNAs and ncRNAs, which were extended at their 3&#x2019; ends (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Oligo(dT)-primed RT-PCR showed that read-through RNAs were polyadenylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>), suggesting that non-canonical polyadenylation sites were more frequently used in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant than in wild-type cells, as already described for cells lacking Dis3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lemay et al., 2014</xref>). GO term analysis revealed no specific feature defining the population of read-through transcripts that accumulate in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells. Furthermore, only 111 of the 489 read-through transcripts were also up-regulated (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>), which suggests that the 3&#x2019;-extended RNAs were not the by-product of increased transcription.</p>
<p>To further investigate the molecular origin of read-through RNAs in condensin mutant cells, we compared <italic>cut14-208</italic> with <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> cells. We detected 622 read-through RNAs, again mostly mRNAs and ncRNAs, in the transcriptome of cells lacking Rrp6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), which confirms previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lemay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zofall et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, 50&#x0025; of these RNAs were also extended at their 3&#x2019;ends in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). This reinforces the idea that the function of Rrp6 might be affected in a <italic>cut14-208</italic> background. Note that the steady state level of the Rrp6 protein remained unchanged in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>). Likewise, we observed no change in the mRNA levels of RNA-exosome or TRAMP components in the condensin mutant by RNA-seq (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that 3&#x2019;-extended read-through transcripts accumulate upon condensin inactivation in fission yeast and that this accumulation might stem from defects in RNA processing of these transcripts by Rrp6.</p>

<title>Condensin is dispensable for gene expression during interphase and metaphase in fission and budding yeasts</title>
<p>Since condensin is regulated over the course of the cell cycle, we sought to determine the phase(s) during which condensin function is required for proper gene expression. We synchronised <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells in early S phase at the permissive temperature, raised the temperature to 36&#x00B0;C to inactivate condensin and at the same time released them into the cell cycle. We then measured gene expression by RT-qPCR as cells progressed from early S phase into the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To ensure that cells went only through a single cell cycle at 36&#x00B0;C, we re-arrested cells in late G1 phase by the thermosensitive mutation <italic>cdc10-129</italic>. Previous work had shown that 10 min at 36&#x00B0;C are sufficient to inactivate condensin in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nakazawa et al., 2011</xref>). FACScan analysis of DNA content and cytological observations revealed that <italic>cdc10-129</italic> single mutant and <italic>cdc10-129 cut14-208</italic> double mutant cells completed S phase (t = 30 min after release) and progressed through G2 phase (t = 60 min) and mitosis (t = 90 min) with similar kinetics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Chromosome segregation was impaired in <italic>the cut14-208</italic> mutant background, as revealed by the appearance of anaphase chromatin bridges (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, green line), which were subsequently severed by the septum upon mitotic exit, producing the CUT phenotype (Cells Untimely Torn) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, red line). Accordingly, FACScan analysis revealed the appearance of aberrant karyotypes in post-mitotic cells (t = 120 and 180 min; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Remarkably, we measured no up-regulation of any of the three reporter RNAs that we had selected from the pool of upregulated transcripts in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) during G2 phase in synchronized <italic>cdc10-129 cut14-208</italic> cells (t = 60 min, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These RNAs started to accumulate, however, at t = 90 min and further increased at t= 120 min and 180 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), coincidently with the accumulation of aneuploid post-mitotic cells. This result suggests a possible requirement for condensin for proper gene expression during late mitosis or early G1 phase. To validate these results, we repeated the RT-qPCR measurements by synchronously releasing <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells from the early S phase block only 1 hour after shifting the temperature to 36&#x00B0;C and re-arrested them already at the G2/M transition using a <italic>cdc25-22</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). In this time course experiment, we observed no up-regulation of the reporter RNAs at any time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similarly, RNA levels remained unchanged after a sustained arrest in metaphase at 36&#x00B0;C by depletion of the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) activator Slp1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-I</xref>). We conclude that, in fission yeast, the function of condensin is dispensable for gene regulation during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, consistent with the finding that condensin is largely displaced from the nucleus during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sutani et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Condensin in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is, in contrast, bound to chromosomes throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">D&#x2019;Ambrosio et al., 2008</xref>), much like the condensin II complex in metazoan cells. This raises the possibility that condensin controls interphase gene expression in this species. We first confirmed that condensin localizes to chromosomes of cells released synchronously into the cell cycle from a G1 mating pheromone arrest (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Chromosome spreading and ChIP showed that condensin bound to chromosomes already during G1 phase and that its levels on chromosomes increased as cells passed through S and G2 phases (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B-C</xref>). To inactivate condensin in budding yeast, we proteolytically cleaved the kleisin (Brn1) subunit of the condensin ring by inducing expression of a site-specific protease from tobacco etch virus (TEV) using a galactose-inducible promoter, which efficiently released condensin from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>), even during G1 phase (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>). We then compared the transcriptome of G1 phase-arrested cells after condensin cleavage to cells with intact condensin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Remarkably, solely 26 transcripts were differentially expressed by at least two-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). To rule out that this minor effect on gene expression was the result of the G1 phase arrest, we repeated the experiment, but this time released cells after Brn1 TEV cleavage from the G1 phase arrest and re-arrested them in the subsequent M phase by addition of the spindle poison nocodazole before preparing RNA for transcriptome analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In this experiment, only six genes showed an up-or downregulation of two-fold or more (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). We conclude that condensin inactivation by releasing the complex from chromosomes has no major effects on the gene expression program of budding yeast cells.</p>

<title>Gene expression changes in fission yeast condensin mutants are the result of a loss of genome integrity</title>
<p>The fact that we observed changes in transcription levels in asynchronously dividing <italic>cut14-208</italic> fission yeast mutant cells, but not in fission or budding yeast condensin mutants that are prevented from undergoing anaphase, raises the possibility that defects in chromosome segregation caused by condensin inactivation might be causally responsible for condensin-dependent gene deregulation. Indeed, when we arrested fission yeast <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells at the G2/M transition using the analogue-sensitive Cdc2asM17 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoi et al., 2014</xref>), shifted the temperature to 36&#x00B0;C and then released them from the arrest to complete mitosis, we measured an increase in transcript levels after mitotic exit and the severing of chromosomes (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>If RNA misregulation were indeed caused by the severing of missegregated chromosomes by the cytokinetic ring, then three key hypotheses should prove correct: (1) any mutation that results in chromosome missegregation and cutting upon mitotic exit should result in an increase in levels of the same or a similar set of RNAs as the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation, (2) the amplitude of the increase in RNA levels should correlate with the prevalence of missegregation, and (3) preventing chromosome cutting in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells should attenuate the changes in RNA levels. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, mutation of separase (<italic>ptr4-1</italic>) or of a subunit of the APC/C (<italic>cut9-665</italic>) results in chromosome missegregation and severing by the cytokinetic ring upon mitotic exit and an increase in RNA levels in a manner similar to <italic>cut14-208</italic>. Moreover, the amplitude of the increase in RNA levels correlated with the frequency of chromosome cutting in the different mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The analysis of five additional condensin mutations of increasing prevalence further confirmed this correlation (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that RNA levels remained comparable to wild-type in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells that were prevented from undergoing cytokinesis. The thermosensitive <italic>cdc15-140</italic> mutation prevents cytokinesis at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balasubramanian et al., 1998</xref>). Double mutant cells <italic>cdc15-140 cut14-208</italic> exhibited chromatin bridges during anaphase at 36&#x00B0;C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that <italic>cdc15-140</italic> did not supress the chromosome segregation defect caused by the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutation. However, in the absence of a cytokinetic ring, these chromatin bridges were no longer severed upon mitotic exit, which suppressed the production of karyotypically-aberrant post-mitotic cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Remarkably, parallel RNA-seq analysis revealed that &#x223C;98&#x0025; of the RNA up-regulated in the <italic>cut14-208</italic> single mutant were no-longer detected as differentially expressed in the double mutant <italic>cut14-208 cdc15-140</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>). The suppressive effect of <italic>cdc15-140</italic> on <italic>cut14-208</italic> with respect to the accumulation of the anti-sense RNA <italic>mug93as</italic> is shown as an example in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>. The production of read-through transcripts was similarly suppressed (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C-D</xref>). Note that RNA levels remained increased in the <italic>cdc15-140 rrp6&#x0394;</italic> mutant (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>), ruling out a potential compensatory effect of <italic>cdc15-140</italic> on Rrp6 deficiency per se. Finally, we found that <italic>cdc12-112,</italic> another mutation that also impairs cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chang et al., 1997</xref>), equally restored normal gene expression in a <italic>cut14-208</italic> genetic background (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5F</xref>), confirming that cytokinesis was a driving force for the gene deregulation exhibited by the <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant. Taken together, these data indicate that changes in gene expression exhibited by <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells are mostly, if not entirely, the consequence of cytokinesis when condensin is inactivated.</p>

<p>The severing of chromosomes by the cytokinetic ring leads to DNA damage, as revealed by the accumulation of sustained Rad22-GFP foci (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>), but also to the formation of genomically-aberrant daughter cells, as shown by FACScan analysis of DNA contents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Both phenotypes coincide with the increase in RNA levels, and both are suppressed by <italic>cdc15-140</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">S6A</xref>). To test whether one or both might be responsible for gene deregulation in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells, we analysed by RT-qPCR the impact of DNA damage upon mitotic exit, or of genomic imbalance, on gene expression in cells provided with a fully functional condensin. To damage DNA, cells were synchronized in prometaphase by using the cryosensitive mutation <italic>nda3-KM311</italic>, and released into mitosis in the presence of Camptothecin to induce DNA breaks during S phase, which in fission yeast overlaps with cytokinesis and septum formation. As an alternative experiment, wild-type cycling cells were treated with Zeocin. The appearance of sustained Rad22-GFP foci in cells treated with Camptothecin or with Zeocin confirmed the accumulation of DNA damage (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). However, RT-qPCR revealed no increase in RNA levels (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>), arguing that DNA damage is not the main driver for gene deregulation in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells.</p>
<p>To test the impact of genomic imbalance on gene expression, we used the thermosensitive <italic>mis6-302</italic> mutation which disrupts kinetochore assembly, and hence accurate chromosome segregation during anaphase, leading to the production of aneuploid post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saitoh et al., 1997</xref>). Note that <italic>mis6-302</italic> causes neither chromatin bridges nor a CUT phenotype. FACScan analysis of <italic>mis6-302</italic> cells grown at the restrictive temperature confirmed the appearance of genomically-aberrant cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Remarkably, RT-qPCR of four reporter RNAs revealed a similar increase in <italic>mis6-302</italic> cells as in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Therefore, this result strongly suggests that the imbalance in genomic content that results from chromosome missegregation during mitosis is a major cause of gene deregulation when condensin function is impaired.</p>

<title>Non-disjunction of the rDNA during anaphase depletes the RNA-exosome from post-mitotic fission yeast cells and results in ncRNA accumulation</title>
<p>To investigate further the mechanism of gene deregulation when condensin is impaired, we looked in more details at chromosome segregation during anaphase in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells. It has been reported that condensin plays a major role in the segregation of the rDNA in late anaphase in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">D&#x2019;Ambrosio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freeman et al., 2000</xref>). We reached the same conclusion in fission yeast. When we scored the segregation of a GFP-labelled version of the rDNA-binding protein Gar2 in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, we found that sister rDNA copies failed to separate during anaphase, frequently resulting in the formation of anucleolate daughter cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The <italic>ptr4-1</italic> and <italic>mis6-302</italic> mutants also exhibited a high rate of anucleolate cell formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) and the <italic>cdc15-140</italic> mutation supressed the formation of anucleolate cells in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutants (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>). Thus, the inability to properly segregate the rDNA during anaphase correlates with the accumulation of mRNAs and ncRNAs targeted by the RNA-exosome.</p>
<p>Live imaging of Rrp6 and Dis3 has revealed that the two RNases are enriched in the nucleolus of fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Given the overlap between the differential transcriptomes of <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> mutants, we hypothesised that rDNA non-disjunction might alter the localisation of Rrp6 in daughter cells upon mitotic exit. Co-immunostaining of Rrp6 tagged with a myc epitope and Gar2 tagged with GFP confirmed the nuclear localisation of Rrp6 and its marked enrichment within the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In a wild-type background, Rrp6 appeared evenly distributed between nuclei in post-mitotic daughter cells (median signal ratio &#x223C;1). In sharp contrast, the amount of Rrp6 was markedly reduced in <italic>cut14-208</italic> anucleolate daughter cells compared to their nucleolate counterparts (median signal ratio &#x223C;0.25; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). We observed a similar asymmetrical distribution of Dis3 tagged with an HA epitope in post-mitotic <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref>). Thus, condensin deficiency leads to rDNA non-disjunction during anaphase and the production of anucleolate post-mitotic cells, which are depleted of Rrp6 and Dis3.</p>
<p>The depletion of Rrp6 and Dis3 provided a plausible cause for the accumulation of exosome-sensitive RNA in asynchronously dividing <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells. If it were the case, exosome-sensitive RNAs should accumulate preferentially in anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells. Single molecule RNA-FISH showed that the ncRNA <italic>mug93as</italic> produced very faint signals in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), consistent with its active degradation by the RNA-exosome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>mug93as</italic> levels were considerably higher in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, which confirms our previous RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Crucially, <italic>mug93as</italic> RNA accumulated mainly in anucleolate cells devoid of Gar2-GFP, whereas a control mRNA (<italic>cct2</italic>) was evenly distributed in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). We conclude that condensin loss-of-function in fission yeast leads to the formation of anucleolate cells that accumulate RNA-exosome-sensitive transcripts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Condensin I and II have been implicated in the control of gene expression in a wide range of organisms, but it has remained unclear what aspect of the gene expression program they affect. Here, we challenge the idea that condensin complexes directly regulate transcription by providing compelling evidence that the functional integrity of condensin is dispensable for the maintenance of proper gene expression during interphase and even mitosis in fission and budding yeasts. Consistent with previous studies, we show that condensin deficiency alters the transcriptome of post-mitotic cells in fission yeast. However, we further show that this effect is mostly, if not entirely, the indirect consequence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase, which notably depletes the RNA-exosome from daughter cells. Our findings therefore indicate that condensin plays no direct role in the control of gene expression in fission and budding yeasts, but is essential for the maintenance of proper gene expression by contributing to the accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.</p>
<p>Strand-specific RNA seq analysis revealed that <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant cells accumulate mRNA, ncRNA and 3&#x2019;-extended read-through transcripts. Additional condensin mutants such as <italic>cut3-477, cut3-m26, cut14-90</italic> and <italic>cut14-180</italic> exhibited similar increases in RNA levels, arguing that condensin takes part in proper gene expression in fission yeast, alike in other organisms. The population of <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin-mutant cells that exhibited increased RNA levels went through G2, M, G1, and S phases at the restrictive temperature in an asynchronous manner before their RNA was extracted and analysed. However, when <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells were synchronised during the S or G2 phases or even during metaphase, RNA levels remained unchanged. Moreover, the prevalent suppressive effect of <italic>cdc15-140</italic> upon <italic>cut14-208</italic> in term of changes in gene expression, argues (1) that condensin impinges on gene expression in a cytokinesis-dependent manner, and therefore in an indirect manner, and (2) that condensin deficiency has in itself no predominant impact on the steady state level of RNAs in post-mitotic cells. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that subtle impacts of condensin on the dynamics of transcription might have escaped our detection, our data strongly indicate that condensin plays no major direct role in the maintenance of proper gene expression during interphase and even mitosis in fission yeast. Concordantly, we show that in budding yeast too, condensin is largely dispensable for the maintenance of gene expression during the G1 phase or during metaphase. Importantly, our results are in perfect agreement with recent data supporting the idea that the global transcriptional program of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is largely insensitive to condensin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paul et al., 2017</xref>). Note that the separation of the budding and fission yeast lineages is thought to have occurred &#x223C; 420 million years ago, which makes them as different from each other as either is from animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>). Thus, our results provide compelling evidence that, in two evolutionarily distant organisms, condensin complexes play no major direct role in the maintenance of an established gene expression program.</p>
<p>The corollary is that the increased RNA levels exhibited by fission yeast <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells must be the indirect consequence of a failure during late mitosis caused by a lack of condensin activity. This conclusion is in agreement with our observation that RNA levels increase coincidently with mitotic exit in synchronized condensin-mutant cells. In line with this, we provide evidence that the non-disjunction of the duplicated copies of the rDNA during anaphase constitutes a major source of gene deregulation in condensin mutant cells. (1) We show that sister-rDNA almost systematically fail to disjoin during anaphase in <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells, leading to the production of anucleolate daughter cells. (2) Rrp6 and Dis3 are enriched in the nucleolus in wild-type cells, but largely depleted from anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells. Rrp6 accumulates predominantly on chromosomes during mitosis in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Graham et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the bulk of Rrp6 and Dis3 might similarly co-segregate with the nucleolus during anaphase in fission yeast. (3) We show by RNA-seq, RT-qPCR and Northern blotting that the depletion of Rrp6 and Dis3 from anucleolate condensin mutant cells coincides with an increased steady state level of RNA-exosome-sensitive transcripts. Note that the slight additive effect exhibited by the <italic>cut14-208</italic> and <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> mutations with respect to the accumulation of <italic>mug93as</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and of 3&#x2019;-extented <italic>hsp9</italic> RNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) is consistent with the co-depletion of Rrp6 and Dis3 from anucleolate <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells. (4) We further show by RNA-FISH that an RNA-exosome sensitive transcript, the antisense RNA <italic>mug93as,</italic> accumulates principally if not exclusively in anucleolate condensin mutant cells, as expected from an impaired degradation. (5) Importantly, supressing the production of anucleolate daughter cells by the cytokinesis mutation <italic>cdc15-140</italic>, in a <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant background, is sufficient to restore an almost normal transcriptome, despite condensin remaining impaired. Mitosis being closed in fission yeast, when cytokinesis is prevented, anaphase chromatin bridges and the nucleolus collapse into a single nucleus upon mitotic exit. (6) Finally, we show that, reciprocally, generating anucleolate and aneuploid daughter cells by disrupting chromosome segregation by the kinetochore mutation <italic>mis6-302</italic>, is sufficient to trigger the accumulation of RNA-exosome-sensitive transcripts, alike <italic>cut14-208</italic>, but without mutating condensin.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we propose the model depicted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>. Condensin deficiency impairs chromosome segregation and notably leads to chromatin bridges and the non-disjunction of the rDNA during anaphase. Rrp6 and Dis3, which are enriched in the nucleolus, and which most likely segregate with the bulk of the rDNA during anaphase, become depleted from anucleolate daughter cells produced upon mitotic exit. This strongly reduces the activity of the RNA-exosome in anucleolate daughter cells, allowing the accumulation of RNA molecules that are normally actively degraded by the RNA-exosome, such as ncRNAs and 3&#x2019;-extended RNAs. This sequence of events illustrate how condensin deficiency indirectly changes gene expression in fission yeast.</p>

<p>In wild-type fission yeast cells, Rrp6 and Dis3, the catalytic subunits of the RNA-exosome, are enriched in the nucleolus and most likely co-segregate with the bulk of the rDNA during anaphase. In condensin mutant cells, chromosomes fail to properly segregate during anaphase. Chromatin bridges are formed and entangled sister-rDNA copies fail to separate. The non-disjunction of the rDNA upon mitotic exit leads to the production of anucleolate daughter cells deprived of Rrp6 and Dis3, which start to accumulate RNA molecules that are normally actively degraded by the RNA-exosome, such as unstable ncRNA and 3&#x2019;-extended RNA.</p></caption>

<p>That the bulk of the nucleolar RNA-exosome might co-segregate with the rDNA during mitosis has some consequences in the fields of gene silencing and RNA export. Condensin has been implicated in gene silencing at pericentric heterochromatin in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al., 2016</xref>). However, since Rrp6 is known to take part in the turnover of heterochromatic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>), it will be important to assess to which extent chromosome missegregation during anaphase might account for the alleviation of silencing observed in condensin-mutant cells. Likewise, genetic screens for factors involved in the nuclear export of polyadenylated mRNAs have led to the isolation of various unrelated mutations that all generate anucleolate cells, including mutations in condensin in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ideue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paul and Montpetit, 2016</xref>). This has raised the idea that the nucleolus takes part in the nuclear export of mRNAs. However, since we observed no nuclear retention of <italic>cct2</italic> mRNA in anucleolate condensin-mutant cells, and since non-coding RNA are heavily polyadenylated in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), we propose that the accumulation of polyadenylated transcripts in anucleolate cells might reflect an impaired processing of non-coding RNAs by the RNA-exosome rather than a defective export. The finding that Dis3 or Rrp6 loss-of-function increases the concentration of polyadenylated transcripts in the nucleolus of budding yeast cells is in good agreement with this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paul and Montpetit, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional mechanisms linked to chromosome instability and the genesis of aberrant karyotypes in post-mitotic cells most likely contribute to modify the transcriptome when condensin I or II is defective. The slight up-regulation of histone genes that we observed in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells has previously been attributed to an indirect stabilization of the transcription factor Ams2 during defective anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). More broadly, aneuploidy itself is known to change the transcriptome, with a recurrent increased expression of genes involved in the response to stress and a down-regulation of cell-cycle and proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>). Premalignant murine T-cells defective for condensin II exhibit a transcriptome evocative of a stress response to aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the depletion of Smc2, and hence the reduction of both condensin I and II, in a human neuroblastoma cell line modifies the expression of a large number of genes implicated mainly in cell cycle progression or DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Murakami-Tonami et al., 2014</xref>). However, we did not observed such a clear transcriptomic signature in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, suggesting either that aneuploidy per se, i.e. the gain or loss of entire chromosomes, is not a prevalent condition when condensin is impaired in fission yeast, or that condensin-mediated aneuploidy is strongly counter-selected in asynchronous cultures, perhaps because most aneuploid cells are unviable or extremely unstable in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Niwa and Yanagida, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Our finding that sister-rDNA almost systematically non-disjoin during anaphase in fission yeast condensin mutant cells is reminiscent of the severe missegregation of the rDNA observed in budding yeast and human cells deprived of functional condensin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">D&#x2019;Ambrosio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Freeman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Samoshkin et al., 2012</xref>), and is consistent with the idea that decatenation of sister-rDNA during late anaphase relies upon condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">D&#x2019;Ambrosio et al., 2008</xref>). What remains puzzling, however, is the fact that chromatin bridges are almost systematically severed by the cytokinetic ring in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells, while the severing of the nucleolus is extremely infrequent (&#x003C;10&#x0025; of the cases). The persistence of the nucleolus in the axis of cleavage might mechanically hinder cytokinesis, or trigger a wait signal. Alternatively, condensin deficiency might cause DNA double-strand breaks at fragile sites located on the centromere-proximal border of the cluster of rDNA repeats, allowing the displacement of untangled sister-rDNA towards one pole of the mitotic spindle through a spring-relaxation effect. A focused role for condensin in organising a region proximal to the rDNA, and located on its centromeric side, has been reported in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schalbetter et al., 2017</xref>). In HeLa cells, the depletion of SMC2 induces DNA breaks predominantly in repetitive DNA, including the rDNA/Nucleolar Organising Regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Samoshkin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus missegregation of the rDNA in fission yeast cells when condensin is impaired might reveal an evolutionarily-conserved acute dependency of repeated DNA elements upon condensin for their segregation and integrity. Given the prevalence of tandem repetitive DNA arrays in mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Warburton et al., 2008</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that condensin loss of function might have similar confounding impacts on the preservation of their structural integrity and proper expression.</p>
<p>Studies performed over the last 20 years have shown that the tri-dimensional organization of the genome influences gene expression, raising the key question of the role played by SMC complexes in the control of gene expression. A large number of studies have concluded in favour of a role for cohesin and condensin I and II in the control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dowen and Young, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>), raising the idea that cohesin and condensins might collectively link gene expression to genome architecture. Although there are robust examples of cohesin-mediated regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>), for instance through enhancer-to-promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ing-Simmons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>), a recent study has raised the idea that the involvement of cohesin in the maintenance of an established gene expression program might be less prominent than initially thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, despite ample reports of cells defective for condensin I or II exhibiting changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bhalla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dowen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Iwasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lupo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Murakami-Tonami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yuen et al., 2017</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, there has been thus far no clear case where the influence of condensin I or II on gene expression has been dissociated from a possible confounding effect of chromosome missegregation. By providing evidence that condensin plays no major direct role in the control of gene expression in fission and budding yeasts, and showing that condensin impinges on gene expression by preserving the stability of the genome during mitosis, our work challenges the concept of gene regulation as a collective property of SMC complexes, and should help better define future studies on the role of canonical condensins in gene expression in other organisms.</p>

<title>RNase digestion and Northern blot</title>
<p>For RNase H digestion, total RNA was hybridized with a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to a sequence located at the 5&#x2019; end of the <italic>hsp9</italic> mRNA and digested with RNase H (Roche) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. For Northern blotting, total or RNase H-digested RNA was resolved on 1&#x0025; agarose gel supplemented with formaldehyde 0.7&#x0025; (v/v), transferred onto Hybond-XL nylon membranes (Amersham) and cross-linked. Pre-hybridization and overnight hybridization were carried out in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) at 68&#x00B0;C. Strand-specific RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription using the T7 riboprobe system (Ambion) and internally labelled with [&#x03B1;-32P]-UTP. Membranes were quickly washed with 2X SSC and 0,1&#x0025; SDS, 10 min in 2X SSC and 0,1&#x0025; SDS, and 3 times in 0,2X SSC and 0,1&#x0025; SDS.

<title>RNA-seq and analysis</title>
<p>RNA-seq was performed on biological triplicates. Total RNA was extracted from 2&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup> yeast cells by standard hot-phenol method. RNA quality was determined using TapeStation (Agilent) with RINe score &#x003E;9. Ribosomal RNA was removed by treating 2 &#x00B5;g of total RNA with the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Yeast) (MRZY1324, Illumina, Paris, France). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded kit. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq 4000, with single-end reads of 50 nt in length. Total number of reads per sample ranged from 59 million to 93 million. For in-silico analyses, we used the version 2.30 of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome in fasta format and the corresponding gff3 annotations downloaded from the ebi website (2017/03/22). Scripts are available in the following git repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/LBMC/readthroughpombe">https://github.com/LBMC/readthroughpombe</ext-link>. The RNA-seq reads were processed with cutadapt to remove adaptors and further trimmed with UrQt (--t 20) based on their quality. After quality control with fastqc, we built the reverse complement of the reads in the fastq files using seqkit, indexed the genome (-build) and mapped the trimmed fastq files (--very-sensitive) using Bowtie2. Mapping output files were saved in bam format with samtools (view-Sb).</p>
<p>To detect read-through events, we searched for sections of reads located immediately downstream of the 3&#x2019; ends of annotated transcription units, on the same DNA strand, and within gene-free intergenic regions. First, broad peaks of RNA-seq reads were identified using the peak caller Music (v6613c53). Bam files were sorted and filtered as forward or reverse with samtools (view -hb -F 0&#x00D7;10 or view -hb -f 0&#x00D7;10). The gff annotation file was converted to bed with convert2bed from bedtools, the genome indexed with samtools (faidx) and the annotation file split into forward and reverse with bedtools (complement). Next, reads corresponding to annotated transcripts were removed using samtools view (-hb bams -L annotation). Subtracted bam files were sorted with samtools sort, and RNA-seq peaks located outside annotated transcripts were detected with Music (-get_per_win_p_vals_vs_FC -begin_l 50 -end_l 500 -step 1.1 -l_mapp 50 -l_frag 363 -q_val 1 -l_p 0). The resulting annotation was further filtered by removing peaks whose starting positions were located more than 2 read-length away from the nearest 3&#x2019;ends. Only peaks detected in at least 2 out of 3 biological replicates were considered. Read-through detection was performed independently for the <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutants. To achieve comparable examination between <italic>rrp6&#x0394;</italic> and <italic>cut14-208</italic> for reads quantification, we merged their respective read-through annotations and sorted them with bedtools (sort) and extracted the forward and reverse reads from the bam files with bedtools (bamtofastq). We generated the list of transcript sequences from the genome and the annotation with bedtools (getfasta -s). The transcript sequences were then indexed with kallisto (index-k 31 --make-unique) and the quantification achieved with kallisto (quant &#x2013;single -l 363.4 -s 85.53354). Quantifications were performed separately on the transcript alone and on the transcript plus read-through annotation.</p>
<p>Quantifications in mutant strains compared to wt were performed using the package DESeq2 with R (v3.4.4). For differential expression analyses, we tested for log2 fold change superior to 0.5 or inferior to &#x2212;0.5. For read-through events, we tested for a log2 fold change superior to 0 compared to the wild type to declare the read-through present in the mutant background. For all analyses, we selected p-values with an FDR &#x003C;= 0.05. The package ggplot2 (v2.2.1) was used for graphics.</p>

<caption><title>Defective mitosis underlies deregulated gene expression in the fission yeast <italic>cut14-208</italic> condensin mutant</title>
<p><bold>A-C.</bold> Gene expression was assessed in synchronized <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells progressing through mitosis. <bold>A.</bold> Cells expressing the analogue-sensitive Cdc2asM17 kinase were arrested at the G2/M transition in the presence of 3-Br-PP1 (2 &#x00B5;M), shifted at 36&#x00B0;C, released into mitosis and re-arrested in late G1 phase by the <italic>cdc10-129</italic> mutation. <bold>B.</bold> DNA content was assessed by FACScan analysis and mitotic progression by cytological observation. DNA was stained with DAPI and the septum with calcofluor. The frequencies of chromatin bridges (red line) and chromosome cutting by the septum (green line) are shown. <bold>C.</bold> Total RNA extracted from wild-type and <italic>cut14-208</italic> cells shown in <bold>B</bold> was reverse-transcribed in the presence or absence of RT and cDNA quantified by qPCR.</p></caption>

<p><bold>A-B.</bold> The amplitude of increase in RNA levels correlates with the prevalence of chromosome severing. Indicated cells were grown at 36&#x00B0;C for 2.5 hours and processed for cytological analysis of chromosome segregation or RT-qPCR. <bold>A.</bold> Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence against &#x03B1;-tubulin. DNA was stained with DAPI. Chromosome segregation was assessed in anaphase cells exhibiting a mitotic spindle &#x2265; 6 &#x00B5;m in length (n &#x2265; 100). CUT phenotype (chromosome severing by the septum) was assessed by staining DNA with Hoechst 3342 and the septum by calcofluor (n &#x2265; 100). Shown are averages &#x00B1; SDs from biological triplicates. <bold>B.</bold> Total RNA extracted from cells grown at 36&#x00B0;C was reverse-transcribed in the presence or absence of RT and the cDNA quantified by qPCR.

<caption><title>Condensin inactivation generates anucleolate daughter cells in fission yeast, which are depleted of the RNases Rrp6 and Dis3 and accumulate unstable RNA</title>
<p><bold>A.</bold> <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells accumulate DNA damage that can be suppressed by <italic>cdc15-140</italic>. Cells expressing Rad22-GFP were grown at 36&#x00B0;C for 2.5 hours, fixed and stained with DAPI. Cells exhibiting at least one Rad22-GFP focus were scored. Shown are the averages &#x00B1; SDs calculated from biological triplicates with more than 100 cells per experiment. <bold>B.</bold> DNA damage does not increase RNA levels as <italic>cut14-208</italic>. Cells expressing Rad22-GFP were synchronised in prometaphase by the <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutation and released in mitosis in the presence of Camptothecin (CPT), or its vehicle DMSO, to induce DNA damage upon mitotic exit. Asynchronously growing cells expressing Rad22-GFP were treated with zeocin to induce DNA double-strand breaks. The prevalence of DNA damage was measured by scoring Rad22-GFP foci. RNA levels in cells experiencing DNA damage were assessed by RT-qPCR. Shown are averages &#x00B1; SDs calculated from biological triplicates. <bold>C.</bold> The <italic>cdc15-140</italic> mutation prevents the production of anucleolate cells in a <italic>cut14-208</italic> genetic background. Cells expressing Gar2-GFP were grown at 36&#x00B0;C for 2.5 hours, fixed and stained with DAPI to score the percentage of anucleolate cells. Shown are the averages &#x00B1; SDs calculated from biological triplicates with more than 100 cells per experiment. <bold>D.</bold> Dis3 is enriched in the nucleolus and segregates asymmetrically in <italic>cut14-208</italic> mutant cells (arrow). Indicated cells were grown at 36&#x00B0;C, fixed with ethanol and processed for immunofluorescence against Dis3-HA. DNA was stained with DAPI. Right panel shows the ratio of Dis3-HA signals measured within daughter nuclei in septated cells. &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; indicates that the difference is statistically significant with p&#x003C;0.001 by the Chi-square test.</p></caption>
