<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Human norovirus (HuNoV) is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and is spread by fecal shedding that can often persist for weeks to months after infection. Murine norovirus (MNV) is also shed persistently in the feces and provides a tractable model to study molecular mechanisms of enteric persistence. Previous studies have identified non-structural protein 1 (NS1) from the persistent MNV strain CR6 as critical for persistent infection in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), but its mechanism of action remains unclear. We now find that the function of NS1 in promoting persistence is regulated by apoptosis. Following induction of apoptosis in infected cells, a minority of NS1 is cleaved from the precursor NS1/2 protein, and this cleavage is prevented by mutation of caspase target motifs. MNV strain CR6 with these mutations (CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>) is profoundly compromised in infection of IECs and persistence in the intestine. Conversely, replication in tissues outside of the intestine, or in a cultured macrophage cell line, is unchanged, indicating that the requirement of NS1/2 cleavage is intestine-specific. Intriguingly, we also find that cleavage of CR6 NS1/2 potentiates apoptosis, suggesting that regulation of cell death is a novel function of this viral protein. Together, these data indicate that the ability of NS1 to promote MNV persistence in IECs is regulated by host caspases, and suggest that potentiation of apoptosis plays a role in viral tropism in the intestine.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human Norovirus infection is highly contagious and the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus can persist and be shed for months after infection, leading to continued outbreaks. There are many unanswered questions as to host and viral components of norovirus pathogenesis that can be addressed within the murine norovirus (MNV) model system. We previously identified a critical role for a viral protein, NS1, for intestinal persistence. Herein we describe how the regulation of NS1 is critical for persistent infection in intestinal epithelial cells, but is not required for acute infection of non-epithelial cells, or infection of tissues outside of the gut. Additionally, we demonstrate that NS1 is both regulated by the host cell death machinery, and also reciprocally regulates that machinery to promote cell death during MNV infection, and found that this is specific to persistent strain of MNV. Altogether these data identify a role for how NS1 in a new pathway involved in establishing a persistent norovirus infection in the intestine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human norovirus (HuNoV) is the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis, and can be particularly dangerous for infants and the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Persistent viral shedding often occurs for weeks to months after acute infection, even in asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], and is a potential source for continued outbreaks. Despite recent advances in culture systems to study HuNoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], there is still not an efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> or small animal system for investigating the molecular components of HuNoV infection. Fortunately, HuNoV and murine norovirus (MNV) share genotypic (ssRNA, positive-sense, &#x007E;7.5kb genome) and phenotypic (fecal-oral transmission, persistence in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and shedding in the feces) similarities, and utilization of the MNV model system has considerably advanced our molecular understanding of norovirus pathogenesis and persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>All noroviruses encode six non-structural proteins (NS1/2, NS3, NS4, NS5, NS6, and NS7) expressed upon cleavage of the open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) polyprotein by the viral NS6 protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and two structural capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) from ORFs 2 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], respectively. MNV also has a fourth ORF that encodes a unique virulence factor not present in HuNoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Although the non-structural protein NS1/2 is not cleaved by the viral protease, it can be cleaved into two additional proteins (NS1 and NS2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] by the host protease, caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, definitive data regarding the extent and consequences of such caspase cleavage are lacking.</p>
<p>Prior comparison of an acute and a persistent strain of MNV identified two viral proteins that are key components of MNV pathogenesis and persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]: the major capsid protein (VP1) of the acute strain CW3 (VP1<sup>CW3</sup>) drives viral dissemination outside of the intestine, and NS1 of the persistent strain CR6 (NS1<sup>CR6</sup>) is critical for viral persistence in the intestine. Additional <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses demonstrated NS1<sup>CR6</sup> is absolutely required for infection of a specialized type of IEC, the tuft cell, identified as the cellular reservoir for MNV persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Despite the differences in systemic spread and intestinal persistence, both CW3 and CR6 can infect macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells, and B-cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and utilize the same cell-surface receptor, CD300lf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Thus, VP1<sup>CW3</sup> and NS1<sup>CR6</sup> are functioning via mechanisms other than receptor usage and replicative capacity to promote viral dissemination and persistence.</p>
<p>In addition to identified roles of viral proteins in norovirus pathogenesis, critical aspects of the host anti-viral response have also been identified. Particularly important is the multi-faceted interferon (IFN) response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Type I (&#x03B1;/&#x03B2;) and type III (&#x03BB;) IFNs are both key players in the innate anti-viral response, primarily distinguished by the differential expression of their respective receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The IFN-&#x03B1;/&#x03B2; receptor is widely expressed on most cell types, whereas the IFN-&#x03BB; receptor is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells. In regards to MNV, IFN-&#x03B1;/&#x03B2; signaling is critical for control of MNV in myeloid cells, demonstrated by increased titers in macrophages that do not express the IFN-&#x03B1;/&#x03B2; receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], the inability to control systemic MNV infection in mice that specifically lack IFN-&#x03B1;/&#x03B2; receptor expression on myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], and increased dissemination and lethality in mice that do not express the downstream signaling molecule, STAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In contrast to systemic spread, intestinal MNV infection is controlled by IFN-&#x03BB; signaling in IECs, and persistent infection can be cleared and prevented with IFN-&#x03BB; treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, recent data suggests that NS1<sup>CR6</sup> may have a role in antagonizing the IFN-&#x03BB; response during intestinal infection of IECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], but how NS1<sup>CR6</sup> may function in this capacity and whether this is its sole function during persistent infection is unknown.</p>
<p>In addition to the IFN response, host cells also initiate apoptosis as a means of eliminating virus-infected cells. Correspondingly, viruses have evolved ways to hijack apoptotic machinery to their benefit. Apoptosis is a non-inflammatory, highly-regulated disassembly of the cell mediated by a family of cysteine proteases (caspases), and culminates in the release of the cellular contents within membranous vesicles (apoptotic bodies) that are taken up by professional phagocytes, as well as neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Because induction of apoptosis is an innate response to stress or infection, most viruses have developed ways to delay apoptosis in an effort to maximize viral progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], exemplified by a number of large DNA viruses that encode viral homologs of the cellular anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Conversely, influenza virus actively induces apoptosis through manipulation of other Bcl-2 family proteins, which increases viral replication and enhances pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In addition to manipulating apoptosis to prevent cell death or increase viral progeny, a number of viruses, including picornaviruses and flaviviruses, utilize &#x2018;apoptotic mimicry&#x2019; as an alternate mode of egress and viral dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], and some viruses rely on apoptotic caspases to cleave viral proteins as an additional level of regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Thus, apoptosis can be both anti-viral and pro-viral, making its regulation critical for viral pathogenesis.</p>
<p>HuNoV and MNV infection both induce apoptosis, as indicated by association with markers of apoptosis in infected intestinal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Thus, these viruses have likely also developed mechanisms to regulate apoptosis to promote infection. Apoptosis in MNV-infected myeloid cells includes downregulation of an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin, and activation of caspases and other cysteine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, independent expression of the MNV ORF1 polyprotein, which encodes the non-structural proteins (including NS1/2), is also sufficient to induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], indicating one or more non-structural proteins could be promoting apoptosis during infection. Additional analyses of the non-structural proteins identified two functional caspase motifs in NS1/2, and demonstrated that the NS1/2 protein can be cleaved by recombinant caspase 3 in a cell-free system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Based on these published data, apoptosis during MNV infection may be facilitated by one or more non-structural proteins, and the virus may benefit from apoptotic signaling via utilization of a host caspase to regulate expression of NS1, the critical determinant for intestinal persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Herein, we further delineate how NS1<sup>CR6</sup> functions to promote viral persistence by characterizing NS1/2 cleavage during MNV infection and its role in intestinal persistence. We demonstrate that at late times post-infection, concurrent with induction of apoptosis, a minority of total NS1/2 protein is cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner. Despite the relatively low proportion of total NS1/2 that is cleaved, our data demonstrate that NS1/2<sup>CR6</sup> cleavage is absolutely required for persistent infection in IECs, and this involves a function separate from IFN antagonism. Moreover, the cleavage of NS1/2<sup>CR6</sup> potentiates apoptotic cell death <italic>in vitro,</italic> suggesting controlled induction of apoptosis is a novel mechanism required for infection of IECs and intestinal persistence.</p>

<title>Host caspases cleave NS1/2 at late times post-infection</title>
<p>Previous cell-free studies identified two functional caspase motifs (DKAD<sup>121</sup> and DAMD<sup>131</sup>) within NS1/2 that are cleaved by host caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>), however, the necessity and utility of these sites during viral infection was unknown. Therefore, to assess the role of NS1/2 cleavage during viral persistence, we mutated these sites (D<sub>121</sub>G and D<sub>131</sub>G) within the persistent MNV strain, CR6, and named this virus CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Analyses of viral protein expression during MNV infection of BV2 cells demonstrates cleavage of a minority of total NS1/2 protein at late times post-infection with both an acute (CW3) and persistent (CR6) strain of MNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). Cleavage of NS1/2 did not occur in CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-infected cells, demonstrating that it is dependent on the caspase motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>), and, importantly, these mutations did not disrupt overall expression of full-length NS1/2 protein. To determine whether host caspases are responsible for NS1/2 cleavage, cells were treated at 10h post-infection (PI) with a pan-caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk, and indeed, the &#x007E;28kDa NS2 protein was no longer detected in infected cells at late times post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). The &#x007E;18kDa NS1 protein was inconsistently detected in cells via western blot and may be a technical result of the small amounts of overall NS1/2 that get cleaved during infection. Together, these data demonstrate that a small portion of total NS1/2 protein is cleaved by host caspases at relatively late times post-infection with MNV.</p>

<p>The abundance of full-length NS1/2 following infection with CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> indicated that viral protein production was not dependent on these cleavage motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C, D</xref>).

<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses discussed in the following section aimed to assess the role of NS1/2 cleavage on systemic replication as well as intestinal replication of MNV; therefore, we generated CR6 and CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> viral strains that could spread systemically due to chimeric expression of VP1<sup>CW3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. We performed growth curves using these capsid chimeras in parallel with growth curves for CR6 and CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> described above. <italic>In vitro</italic> growth kinetics in BV2 cells and WT BMDCs displayed minimal differences between CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> and CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B, D</xref>). The minor, yet significant, decrease in peak titers of CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> compared to CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> in WT BMDCs but not in BV2 cells indicated NS1/2 cleavage may serve a critical function specific to BMDC cultures. Recently published data suggests a role for NS1<sup>CR6</sup> in IFN antagonism, therefore, we assessed whether NS1/2 cleavage affected growth in BMDC cultures that are not responsive to IFN (<italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDCs). All the MNV strains we analyzed demonstrated higher peak titers in <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDCs compared to WT BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C-F</xref>), confirming the known inhibitory effect of IFNs on MNV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and the decreased replicative capacity of CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> was no longer evident (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref> to 2F). Altogether, these data indicate that NS1/2 cleavage is not necessary for viral replication but may play a role in counteracting the IFN response.</p>

<title>NS1/2 cleavage is critical for persistence in the intestine</title>
<p>To analyze whether NS1/2 cleavage impacts MNV infection of systemic and intestinal tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, we perorally challenged WT B6 mice with 1e6 PFU CR6, CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>, CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> or CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup>, and analyzed tissues at three days post-infection (dpi) for the presence of infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A-D</xref>). As expected, CR6 and CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> were detected within the mesenteric lymph node (MLN), ileum (devoid of Peyer&#x2019;s patches), and colon, the eventual site of persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A, B</xref>). Consistent with the high titers in intestinal tissue, we also detected infectious virus shed in the feces of mice infected with CR6 and CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> at 3dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C, D</xref>). However, in mice infected with CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> or CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup>, we rarely detected infectious virus in intestinal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A, B</xref>), nor being shed in the feces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C, D</xref>), indicating that caspase cleavage of NS1/2 is required for promoting early infection of the intestine.</p>

<p>Although production of infectious virus was severely compromised in intestinal tissues of MNV-infected mice in the absence of NS1/2 cleavage, titers in the spleen were only modestly reduced and not significantly different at 3dpi in the absence of NS1/2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>), indicating that NS1/2 cleavage is not required for systemic spread. Similarly, we were able to detect MNV RNA within the Peyer&#x2019;s patches of animals infected with CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> using the ultra-sensitive <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization platform, RNAscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3F</xref>), and this was not visibly different from CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E-G</xref>). Together, these data suggest no requirement for NS1/2 cleavage during the initial infection in Peyer&#x2019;s patches or for subsequent systemic spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, spleen).</p>
<p>To further verify that NS1/2 cleavage is not required for systemic MNV infection and pathogenesis, we infected <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with either CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> or CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3H</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that VP1<sup>CW3</sup> is critical for systemic spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and lethality in <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that peroral challenge with CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> resulted in lethal MNV infection in <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, and although NS1/2 cleavage is critical for efficient infection in the intestine, CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> infection also resulted in 100&#x0025; mortality in <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3H</xref>). As a control, we infected <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with CR6, which persists, but does not result in lethal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3H</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Overall, our characterization of acute infection demonstrates that NS1/2 cleavage is not required for systemic spread of MNV and is not necessary for lethal pathology in <italic>Stat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. However, NS1/2 cleavage is specifically required for efficient MNV replication in the ileum (outside of Peyer&#x2019;s patches) and colon, the source of virus shed in the stool and the site of eventual persistence.</p>
<p>Due to limited detection of virus at 3dpi in the intestinal tissues of mice infected with CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> and CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup>, we predicted that these mutants would also fail to persist. Indeed, whereas CR6 or CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> persisted in the ileum and colon at 21dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A, B</xref>), and were shed in the stool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C, D</xref>), we rarely detected persistent virus in any tissues from mice infected with CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> or CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). Altogether, these findings support a role for NS1/2 cleavage specifically within the intestinal tissue, and temporally link the activity of NS1/2 cleavage to the first 3 days post-infection. Thus, NS1/2 cleavage is required for establishing an infection in the intestine and subsequent persistence.</p>

<p>Due to the dominant role IFN-&#x03BB; plays in protection against persistent MNV infection of the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and the potential role of NS1/2 cleavage in counteracting IFN signaling in BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C, D</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E, F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], we sought to more thoroughly characterize CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> infection in the absence of IFN-&#x03BB; signaling.

<p>To assess the requirement of NS1/2 cleavage in IEC infection, intestinal tissue devoid of Peyer&#x2019;s patches was mechanically and enzymatically stripped to obtain a single cell suspension and stained for CD45 and EpCAM as markers of immune cells and epithelial cells, respectively. The presence of MNV infection was detected via dual intracellular staining using two distinct antibodies to NS1/2 in mice infected with CR6 or CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B, C</xref>). We analyzed IEC infection in the same mice as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>, including knockouts and littermate controls. Regardless of genotype, we only detected IEC infection when mice were infected with CR6, but not CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B, C</xref>). Additionally, tissue sections were examined via RNAscope, and we reproducibly detected CR6 infection of IECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6D, E</xref>), as well as non-epithelial cells in the lamina propria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6E</xref>) but were unable to find evidence for CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> infection of IECs at 3dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6F</xref>). These data demonstrate the necessity of NS1/2 cleavage for CR6 infection of IECs, the cellular reservoir of MNV persistence. Furthermore, the profound absence of CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> in IECs would translate to a loss of IEC-dependent viral amplification and may explain the reduced titers in Peyer&#x2019;s patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>) and MLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A, B</xref>) during acute infection.

<title>NS1/2 cleavage promotes MNV-induced apoptosis</title>
<p>We next sought to identify an IFN-&#x03BB;-independent cellular response altered by NS1/2 cleavage. Because apoptotic-associated caspases have been implicated in cleavage of NS1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and NS1/2 cleavage is critical for developing a persistent MNV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), we postulated that apoptosis may be altered by NS1/2 cleavage to promote persistent infection in the gut. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that CR6 induced significantly more apoptosis in BV2 cells compared to CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>). This included an increase in the active form of caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A, B</xref>) and an increase in PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>), a known target of activated caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The increase in caspase 3 activity at 18hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>) was not simply due to increased infection in CR6-infected cultures, as there were similar levels of ProPol detected in all infection conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>). We also measured a significant increase in cells expressing phosphatidylserine on the external plasma membrane via Annexin V staining in CR6-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7E-G</xref>). Similarly, there was also an increase in these apoptotic markers following infection with CR6 -VP1<sup>CW3</sup> compared to CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D, E-H</xref>). Furthermore, in support of the hypothesis that NS1/2<sup>CR6</sup> cleavage promotes apoptosis in a manner that is specific for persistence, the acute strain of MNV, CW3, induced less apoptosis in all our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>), despite demonstrating NS1/2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). Interestingly, CR6-VP1<sup>CW3</sup> infection resulted in increased cell permeability and death relative to CR6 at 17hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7E, H</xref>), consistent with our separate findings that VP1<sup>CW3</sup> drives lytic cell death and inflammatory cytokine production (Jacob VanWinkle, et al, manuscript under review). However, even in the context of increased cell lysis associated with VP1<sup>CW3</sup>, we still observed a significant decrease in Annexin V-positivity in the absence of NS1/2<sup>CR6</sup> cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7F, H</xref>), suggesting NS1/2 cleavage is still promoting apoptosis even in the context of lysis and inflammation driven by VP1<sup>CW3</sup>. Together with the preceding data, these findings suggest that potentiation of apoptotic cell death by caspase-mediated cleavage of NS1/2 is critical for determining IEC tropism and persistence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein, we demonstrate that caspase-mediated cleavage of the nonstructural protein, NS1/2, is critical for developing a persistent MNV infection. We engineered and characterized a strain of MNV in which NS1/2 is not cleaved (CR6<sub>&#x2206;casp</sub>), and our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses demonstrate that NS1/2 cleavage is not required for viral replication in myeloid cells but is necessary for infection of IECs, the eventual site of persistence. Furthermore, our data indicate that NS1/2 cleavage potentiates apoptosis, suggesting apoptosis is a critical aspect of establishing a persistent MNV infection.</p>
<p>NS1/2 was not previously known to play a role in cell death during MNV infection, but is required for viral replication beginning at the earliest stages of replication complex assembly. Norovirus replication occurs in the cytoplasm on cellular membranes with a variety of organelle markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], and occurs near membranous vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. MNV NS1/2 targets to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] and promotes replication via membrane re-organization and through an interaction with the vesicle-associated membrane protein, VAPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Similarly, HuNoV NS1/2 also interacts with VAPA, targets to vesicles, and disrupts vesicle trafficking when ectopically expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Our data indicate that the functions of NS1/2 during viral replication remain intact when the caspase cleavage sites are mutated, and viral replication occurs normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). NS1/2 cleavage only occurs after the bulk of viral replication has completed indicating that its role in promoting apoptosis, IEC infection, and persistence involves relatively late events in the viral lifecycle.</p>
<p>The last step of the viral replication cycle is egress. Therefore, NS1/2 cleavage and associated apoptotic death may be important for regulating release of viral progeny. How noroviruses are released from infected cells is not well understood, but infection of macrophages and DCs does result in cell lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], and non-enveloped viruses generally rely on cell lysis to release newly assembled virions. Death by apoptosis may alter this process by reducing lytic virion release and favoring retention of virions within cellular membranes. Indeed, a number of non-enveloped viruses utilize vesicle-associated egress as a means of evasion from immune detection, and vesicles with exposed phosphatidylserine allow for phagocytic uptake of novel target cells that may not express the viral receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. This type of vesicle egress, known as &#x2018;apoptotic mimicry&#x2019;, is also utilized by enveloped viruses which can incorporate phosphatidylserine directly into their viral envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Viruses, or virus-filled vesicles, decorated with phosphatidylserine can inhibit IFN responses via activation of Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases when phagocytosed by dendritic cells (DCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], which would allow more efficient viral replication in those target cells. Thus, vesicular egress has the potential to dramatically change the outcome of infection.</p>
<p>Previous work identified CD300lf as the MNV receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and accordingly, it is expressed on MNV target cells, including myeloid cells and a specialized IEC subtype, tuft cells. Tuft cells are a rare cell type in the intestinal epithelium and are dispersed among non-tuft IECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Interestingly, our analyses often found intestinal villi with multiple, adjacent epithelial cells infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6E</xref>) even though MNV infection has not been shown to alter numbers of tuft cells in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These findings raise the possibility of receptor-independent transfer of MNV to neighboring IECs, which could be mediated by apoptosis or vesicular egress regulated by NS1/2 cleavage. Future work will be necessary to determine whether vesicle-associated egress occurs during norovirus infection and whether it is required for viral persistence.</p>
<p>Regular maintenance of the highly proliferative intestinal epithelium means differentiated epithelial cells have a short lifespan, and undergo a specialized form of apoptotic cell death (anoikis) triggered as the cell detaches from the basal membrane and is shed into the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Specific Bcl-2 family proteins are critical players in anoikis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], and display increased expression as IECs transit up the villus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. It is possible cleavage of NS1/2 (and perhaps NS1 directly) interferes with Bcl-2 family proteins as a means of altering the kinetics of the highly-regulated pathways that control apoptosis within differentiated IECs. Interestingly, similar to NS1/2 cleavage promoting apoptosis during infection, some Bcl-2 proteins (e.g. Bid) are also regulated via cleavage, in which the truncated version is the active, pro-apoptotic form of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. It will be interesting to examine whether NS1/2 interactions with the apoptotic machinery plays a role in maintaining IEC infection.</p>
<p>Death by apoptosis could also function to avoid immune detection and to limit inflammation associated with cell lysis. Virus production that results from cell lysis would promote inflammatory signals to alert the host of an infection. Thus, promotion of an apoptotic cell death in myeloid cells, mediated by NS1/2<sup>CR6</sup> cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>), would limit inflammation and benefit persistence. In addition to professional phagocytes, phagocytosis by non-professional phagocytes (e.g. epithelial cells) is critical for efficient clearance of apoptotic cells, and for limiting inflammation in tissues with high cellular turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Specifically, in a mouse model of colonic injury, phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cells by IECs was sufficient for limiting inflammation in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], and phagocytosis mediated by epithelial cells is similarly critical for reducing inflammation in lung tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and mammary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Thus, intestinal infection that promotes apoptotic death and the phagocytic uptake by IECs would limit host detection and provide a non-inflammatory environment that would allow more efficient infection of IECs and benefit MNV persistence. Regardless of whether apoptotic death limits inflammation or functions by another mechanism, our studies here have suggested potentiation of apoptosis following cleavage of NS1/2 as a new pathway critical for sustained infection of IECs and expanded our understanding of the requirements for viral persistence in the intestine.</p>

<p>All mice (7-9weeks old) were perorally infected with 1e6 PFU in a 25&#x03BC;L volume administered by pipet, with the exception of experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> where 1e6 or 1e7 PFU (as indicated in figure) was administered by oral gavage in a 100&#x03BC;L volume. An equal proportion of males and females were maintained among experimental groups to mitigate results due to any unidentified sex-dependent variables. Same-sex mice, infected with the same MNV strain, were often co-housed for acute infection analyses (less than three days), but singly-housed for extended experiments to prevent continued transmission between animals.</p>
<p>Tissue samples, or a single fecal pellet, were collected in 2ml cryovials with 1mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), frozen in a dry ice/EtOH bath and stored at -80C. For plaque assay or RT-qPCR analyses, either 1ml DMEM or 1ml RiboZol (VWR) was added, respectively, and tissues were homogenized via bead-beating (1min, RT) prior to continued analysis.</p>

<title>RNA, cDNA, and RT-qPCR</title>
<p>RNA from tissues was extracted via RiboZol (VWR) protocols, and RNA from cells was extracted with the ZR Viral RNA kit (Zymoresearch, Irvine, CA). DNA contamination was removed with Turbo DNase (ThermoFisher), and 1ug of RNA was used to generate cDNA with the ImpromII reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). Quantitative PCR was performed using PerfeCTa qPCR FastMix II (QuantaBio, Beverly, MA), and the following oligo/probes were used for detection: MNV genomic RNA - Forward primer CACGCCACCGATCTGTTCTG, Reverse primer GCGCTGCGCCATCACTC, and Probe TGCGCTTTGGAACAATGG; RPS29 - Forward primer GCAAATACGGGCTGAACATG, Reverse primer GTCCAACTTAATG AAGCCTATGTC, and Probe CCTTCGCGTACTGCCGGAAGC.</p>

<title>Intestinal epithelial cell collection</title>
<p>Epithelial fractions were prepared by non-enzymatic striping as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Mice were euthanized and distal small intestine, cecum, and colon (regions of highest MNV replication) were isolated. Peyer&#x2019;s patches were removed from small intestine and intestinal tissues were incubated in stripping buffer (10&#x0025; bovine calf serum, 15 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] in PBS) with shaking for 20 min at 37&#x00B0;C. The dissociated cells were collected as the epithelial fraction, consisting predominantly of IECs and directly used for flow cytometry.</p>

<title>Surface and intracellular staining and flow cytometry</title>
<p>BV2 cells were trypsinized and washed once with 1X PBS, stained with the amine-reactive viability dye, Zombie Aqua (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) (20min, on ice), washed once with cold 2&#x0025; FBS/PBS, washed once with cold Annexin V binding buffer (CST), and stained with Annexin V-FITC (CST) (15min, RT). Cells were immediately analyzed via flow cytometry on an LSR Fortessa (Becton Dickinson [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) with FACSDiva software (BD), and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).</p>
<p>IECs isolated as described above were stained with the Zombie Aqua viability dye (Biolegend), Fc receptors were blocked with purified CD16/CD32 pAb (clone93; Biolegend), and cells were probed for surface markers, EpCAM (clone G8.8; Biolegend) and CD45 (clone 30-F11; Biolegend). Cells were subsequently fixed with 2&#x0025; paraformaldehyde/PBS (10min, RT), and blocked/permeablized in 0.2&#x0025; Triton X/PBS with 2&#x0025; normal goat serum (20min, RT). Fixed and permeabilized cells were probed for intracellular viral antigen with 2 distinct antibodies: Rabbit polyclonal anti-NS1/2 (a gift from Dr. Vernon Ward, U. of Otago, Australia) and mouse monoclonal anti-NS1 (clone CM79, a gift from Dr. Ian Clark, U. of Southampton, UK). These unconjugated antibodies were detected with anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and anti-mouse Dylight 405 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. Cells were analyzed via flow cytometry, and viable cells that were EpCAM&#x002B;, CD45-, NS1/2 pAb&#x002B;, and NS1 mAb&#x002B; were labeled as infected epithelial cells.</p>

<title>RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization via RNAscope&#x00AE;</title>
<p>Sections of approximately two cm from the ileum that contained a Peyer&#x2019;s patch (PP) were selected, cut open lengthwise, pinned apical side up in wax trays, and fixed in 10&#x0025; neutral-buffered formalin (Sigma) (18-24h, RT), then moved to 70&#x0025; EtOH. Tissues were embedded in 2&#x0025; agar (ThermoFisher), the PP was vertically transected, flipped 90 degrees, and re-embedded in 2&#x0025; agar. Agar blocks were maintained in 70&#x0025; EtOH prior to being paraffin-embedded. Tissue sections (5um) were cut and maintained at RT with desiccant until processed. RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics [ACDBio], Newark, CA) per protocol guidelines. Probes were designed by ACDBio for detection of CW3 genomic RNA (471891-C1), CR6 genomic RNA (502631-C1), and EpCAM mRNA (418151-C2), and signals were amplified and detected via ACDBio protocols using TSA<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> plus technology (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).
