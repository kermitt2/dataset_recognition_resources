<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a variant of non-invasive neuro-modulation, which promises treatment for diseases like major depressive disorder or chronic pain for patients resistant to conventional therapies. In experiments, long lasting after-effects were observed, suggesting that plastic changes were induced. The exact mechanism underlying the emergence and maintenance of these after-effects, however, remains elusive. Here we propose a model to explain how transcranial stimulation triggers a homeostatic response of the network involving growth and decay of synapses. In our model, the cortical tissue underneath the electrodes is conceived as a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, in which excitatory-to-excitatory synapses are subject to structural plasticity. Various aspects of stimulation were tested via numerical simulations of such networks, including size and montage of the electrode, as well as intensity and duration of the stimulation. Our results suggest that stimulation indeed perturbs the homeostatic equilibrium and leads to cell assembly formation. Strong focal stimulation, for example, enhances the connectivity of new cell assemblies by increasing the rate of synaptic remodeling. Repetitive stimulation with well-chosen duty cycles increases the impact of stimulation as well. The long-term goal of our work is to optimize the impact of tDCS in clinical applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, where a weak constant current (typically a few mA) is applied to the brain via two or more electrodes attached to the scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">DaSilva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>). In any tDCS montage, electrical charge is delivered to the brain through an anode and a cathode, which establishes an electric field with a specific geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miranda et al., 2006</xref>). Weak electric current passing through the neural tissue and the induced weak electric field are typically not sufficient to trigger action potentials directly, but they are able to either depolarize or hyperpolarize the membrane of single neurons to some degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joucla and Yvert, 2009</xref>). The membrane potential change, however, can influence spike timing and firing rate of neurons which are part of an active network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bikson et al., 2006</xref>). As a consequence, and similar to other methods of neuromodulation, tDCS is claimed to have a certain potential for treating diseases, such as medication-resistant depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nitsche et al., 2009</xref>) or chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Garcia-Larrea, 2016</xref>). It has been shown to have antidepressant effects by targeting the imbalanced activity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Loo et al., 2012</xref>), and to ameliorate neuropathic pain by targeting primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ngernyam et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is a record of promising applications of tDCS, it is not yet clear what its underlying neuronal mechanisms are. Immediate changes of neural activity caused by tDCS have been demonstrated both in humans and in rodents. Positron-emission tomography (PET) in humans revealed that tDCS affects the activity in many different brain regions, but the volume directly underneath the stimulation electrodes is influenced most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lang et al., 2005</xref>). Modeling studies have mapped the relation between the amplitude of the applied current, or the induced electric field strength, respectively, and the changes in the membrane potential of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Datta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>). Experiments in acute hippocampal slices elucidated the relation between the orientation of the electric field (EF) and the resulting neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bikson et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast to the naive expectation that anodal stimulation increases the activity of the stimulated area, while cathodal stimulation inhibits it, the actual effects appear to depend mainly on the orientation of the EF vector relative to the somato-dendritic axis of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wiethoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gluckman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Radman et al., 2009</xref>). When the EF is properly aligned with the somato-dendritic axis (dendrite closer to anode than soma), the somatic membrane potential is depolarized and the neuronal firing rate is increased. For the opposite EF direction, the somatic membrane potential is hyperpolarized and neural activity is attenuated. If the EF is perpendicular to the somato-dendritic orientation, the EF cannot influence the activity of this particular neuron. As a consequence, cells with extended and non-isotropic morphologysuch as pyramidal neurons, should generally be more influenced by tDCS than compact inhibitory neurons. In an effective point neuron model, the polarization induced by an external EF can be equivalently described by a current injected into the soma. This rationale was suggested by the following experimental observation: A uniform EF was able to inhibit KCl-induced epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gluckman et al., 1996</xref>), but an equivalent effect could be achieved by somatic DC injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kayyali and Durand, 1991</xref>). An equivalent effect of current injection and EF exposure was also demonstrated in a simulation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aspart et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the instant activity change during stimulation, sustained alterations of neural activity were also observed in humans after turning the stimulation off. The after-effects of tDCS were first reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nitsche and Paulus (2000)</xref>; they used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) triggering motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the right abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM) as a readout of the after-effects of tDCS in motor cortex. An elevated MEP was reported even 150 min after tDCS application (1mA) in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nitsche and Paulus, 2001</xref>). Such after-effects were later also observed in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Matsunaga et al., 2004</xref>). Follow-up animal studies suggested that the elevated activity and excitability is not due to reverberating network effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gartside, 1968a</xref>). Rather, it was observed that synaptic protein synthesis was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gartside, 1968b</xref>), which already points to elevated synaptic plasticity. Indeed, blocking brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>), NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nitsche et al., 2003</xref>) or calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Monte-Silva et al., 2013</xref>) reduced the increments of field potential amplitudes in mouse motor cortex induced by tDCS. All of these findings taken together suggest very strongly that the observed after-effects are due to an induction of synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Current evidence suggests, however, that multiple forms of plasticity are contributing to tDCS after-effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Monte-Silva et al. (2013)</xref> observed different types of after-effects, linked to different stimulation patterns: Fast facilitation was induced already after a single anodal tDCS session (13 min) and lasted for at least 2h post stimulation. This phenomenon is called early-LTP (e-LTP). In contrast, 26 min anodal stimulation resulted in a reduced MEP amplitude, pointing towards a homeostatic down-regulation. More interestingly, repetitive anodal tDCS with 20 min pauses interspersed (13 min - 20 min - 13 min) resulted in late facilitation. An elevated MEP was observed only one day after the second stimulation, but not immediately afterwards. This is called late-LTP (l-LTP). These results suggest that both Hebbian and homeostatic, as well as functional and structural forms of plasticity could be involved. Functional LTP-like plastic changes of existing synapses were observed in DCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ranieri et al., 2012</xref>). Given the time scales of l-LTP, structural plasticity also seems to play a role in the after-effects. Structural changes at a slower time scale, however, can easily be underestimated due to difficulties measuring spine turnover and changes in dendritic morphology <italic>in vivo.</italic> Homeostatic structural plasticity is constantly taking place in many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Van Ooyen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). For example, in adult barrel cortex and visual cortex, whisker trimming or monocular deprivation, respectively, trigger robust spine remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Oray et al., 2004</xref>). In hippocampal cell cultures, blocking activity with TTX leads to synapse enlargement and synapse cluster formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). In view of all this, it seems very likely that long-lasting after-effects are caused by structural changes in the network, justifying that we use simulations of spiking neural networks with homeostatic structural plasticity to study them. In this paper, we systematically explore the changes in network activity caused by tDCS, and the network remodeling and cell assembly formation induced by this through a homeostatic response of the network. Our simulations also predict that a focused and/or repetitive stimulation with well-chosen duty cycles can boost the effect. This again fits the experiences from tDCS practice with a high-definition montage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kuo et al., 2013</xref>) and repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Monte-Silva et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Immediate effect of transcranial stimulation on network activity</title>
<p>As explained in the Introduction, the direct current applied to the brain during tDCS stimulation induces an electric field (EF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Radman et al., 2009</xref>), and may lead to a membrane potential deflection of the soma, depending on the orientation of the EF relative to the neural somato-dendritic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aspart et al., 2016</xref>). An equivalent effect with regard to membrane potential modulation is achieved by DC injection into the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kayyali and Durand, 1991</xref>). Therefore, in this paper we model tDCS by injecting direct current into the soma of point neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to achieve a small depolarization or hyperpolarization of its membrane potential. The current is compatible with the membrane potential deflection, &#x0394;<italic>V</italic>, and scaled by a geometric factor reflecting the angle between the EF vector and somato-dendritic axis, <italic>&#x03B8;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The angle <italic>&#x03B8;</italic> determines the injected current according to &#x0394;<italic>V</italic> &#x003D; &#x03BB;<italic>E</italic> cos(<italic>&#x03B8;</italic>), where &#x03BB; is a scaling factor, <italic>E</italic> is the EF intensity. The equivalent DC to be injected into the neuron is given by Ohm&#x2019;s law <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="466136_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> where <italic>R<sub>m</sub></italic> is the membrane resistance. The estimated magnitude of the membrane potential deflection induced by sub-threshold tDCS (1&#x2013;2mA) is about 0.1 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>), corresponding to 2.5 pA DC injected into the soma of each model neuron.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="466136_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We then tested if such weak injected current could at all trigger any firing rate changes. We set up a single neuron that generated an ongoing spike train at 8 Hz, as if it was part of a large network. To that end, the ongoing drive from within the network was approximated by a Poisson bombardment. On top of this, we stimulated the neuron by DC injection as described above and observed how the orientation of the EF vector with respect to the orientation of the neuron impacted its firing. Although the overall effect of tDCS stimulation on the membrane potential of the neuron is quite suble, the amplitude of the firing rate change was found to be as large as 1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>This very clearly suggests that tDCS can have an appreciable impact on the activity of spiking neurons in a network, even if the stimulation intensity is very weak. As neuronal spiking is known to affect synaptic connectivity due to activity-dependent plasticity, this raises the question whether direct current stimulation can trigger plastic effects as well. Thus, our next step was to set up a network of point neurons representing the tissue underneath an electrode and find out whether stimulation can alter its structure and its functional dynamics.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Network remodeling triggered by transcranial DC stimulation</title>
<p>We adopt an inhibition-dominated recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to represent the cortical tissue underneath the electrodes. The network consists of 10 000 excitatory and 2 500 inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brunel, 2000</xref>). Neurons are leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, with random but fixed 10&#x0025; E-I, I-I and I-E connection probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). E-E synapses are grown from scratch, subject to a firing rate based homeostatic structural plasticity rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Diaz-Pier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gallinaro and Rotter, 2018</xref>). In this model we fix the set-point of the neuronal firing rate at 8 Hz and used a linear homeostatic rule. Eventually, all excitatory neurons fire at 8 Hz, when the connectivity has grown to about 9&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>In a previous paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gallinaro and Rotter (2018)</xref> explored the associative properties of a similar network subject to firing rate based homeostatic plasticity. They stimulated a subgroup of excitatory neurons with high-rate external Poisson spike trains. The external stimulation disrupted the homeostatic equilibrium of the subgroup, as increased firing rates above the set point led to a deletion of synapses. When the external stimulation was ceased, the firing rate dropped and homeostatic process robustly triggered synapse formation within the stimulated group. In the work discussed here, tDCS is modeled as weak DC injection into the soma, which causes a change in firing rate of all stimulated neurons. Therefore, we expect similar effects to also happen in the network.</p>
<p>We started by stimulating 10&#x0025; of all excitatory (1000) neurons in the network with 2.5 pA DC for 150 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When the firing rate of the stimulated group had reached the set-point (same for all neurons), the connectivity also did not change any more with the stimulation. This suggests that the network reached an equilibrium state (see supplementary Figure S1). At this point, we switched the stimulation off and ran the simulation for another 300 s. We also tried different stimulation parameters and compared the effects, as discussed below. As expected, the firing rate of the stimulated group dropped when the DC was turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and this eventually triggered cell assembly formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The opposite phenomenon was observed in the process of depolarizing DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> illustrates the process of cell assembly formation for the case of 2.5 pA stimulation. Before and after the stimulation, assuming equilibrium in both cases, each neuron receives the same rate of external Poisson input and fires at its target-rate (8 Hz). Thus, the number of input synapses from excitatory neurons should not have changed through stimulation. The only difference will be the source of input synapses: Before the stimulation, input synapses come from both groups of neurons &#x2013; to be stimulated (blue) and background (empty) &#x2013; without any bias. The firing rate of the stimulated neurons is most affected, so when stimulation is off, these neurons have more free synaptic elements to offer. Background neurons, which are less affected by stimulation and deviate less from their target rate, can only offer few synaptic elements to form new connections. Since the formation of new synapses is based on the availability of free elements, this leads to a higher probability of connections to be formed within the stimulated group. In the case of depolarizing DC the opposite process takes place. Thus, any perturbation to the equilibrium of the network firing rate dynamics, no matter whether it is depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, will trigger synaptic turnover and network remodeling by deleting between-group synapses and forming within-group synapses to form a cell assembly.</p>

<title>The effect of polarity of transcranial DC stimulation</title>
<p>In our model, both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current stimulation induce cell assembly formation. Due to the different orientations of neurons in real tissue, neurons underneath the same electrode may not be uniformly depolarized or hyperpolarized. Therefore, we examined how a stimulation with mixed polarity performs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we present two scenarios: bi-population stimulation, in which 30&#x0025; of the excitatory neurons (G1) are depolarized with 2.5 pA whereas the remaining 70&#x0025; (G2) are hyperpolarized with &#x2013; 2.5pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and tri-population stimulation, in which 30&#x0025; of all neurons (G1) are depolarized with 2.5 pA, another group of the same size (G2) are hyperpolarized with &#x2013; 2.5pA, and the remaining 40&#x0025; are not stimulated at all. As expected, a combined depolarizing and hyperpolarizing stimulation resulted in higher connectivity within the cell assembly formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="466136_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To further compare the effects of uni-population, bi-population and tri-population stimulation, we performed a systematic study covering different intensities and stimulated group sizes in all three scenarios: bi-group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), uni-group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and trigroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Throughout, we stimulated the network for 150 s and allowed it to relax for 5 850 s to see the persistent change in connectivity. For an unbiased assessment of both short-lived and quasi-permanent effects, We fit the connectivity curve during the relaxation phase with the sum of three exponential functions and calculated the total integral from an extrapolation of the measurement of stimulation effects on connectivity. In the second panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>), we show the integral of connectivity over time for the population G1, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>G</italic><sub>l</sub></sub>, in three scenarios. In each scenario, the integral of connectivity increases with absolute stimulation intensity and decreases with the size of the stimulated population. Strong and focused stimulation leads to strong effects on the connectivity of the cell assembly.</p>

We found that the increased contrast provided by the opposite polarity generally boosted cell assembly connectivity. <bold>I</bold> We now made G1 and G2 equal in size and only changed the DC amplitude. We stimulated the network for 150 s and allowed it to relax for 5 850 s. The effects were measured in the same way as for <bold>D</bold>-<bold>F</bold>. We found that the larger the discrepancy of stimulus strength is between two populations, the stronger the effect on the emerging connectivity is. The white squares indicate the same stimulus discrepancy between neuronal groups. The combination &#x2013;20 pA and 0 pA yielded stronger effects than &#x2013; 30pA and &#x2013;10pA, or &#x2013;10pA and &#x002B;10pA.</p></caption>

<p>We then performed a comparison between these scenarios A, B and C. When the stimulation is strong and focused, the effect <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub></sub> of scenario B is much stronger than scenario A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). But when the stimulation is weak, the effect of scenario A is larger than scenario B. Therefore, opposite polarities could slightly boost the cell assembly intensity, if the stimulation is weak. However, for strong and/or focused stimulation, uni-group stimulation leads to stronger cell assemblies. Comparing A and B for strong and focused stimulations, the application of same strength negative DC onto the background in A changes the effect of the same stimulation in B. There might be two aspects involved in this phenomenon. Introducing a DC stimulation of reversed polarity increases the discrepancy between intensies of the stimulated group and the background (from &#x0394;<italic>I</italic> to 2&#x0394;<italic>I</italic>), but may inhibit the firing due to network inhibitory effects. To disentangle the problem, we fixed the size of the stimulated group G1 as 50&#x0025; and G2 as 50&#x0025;, and systematically changed the stimulation intensity for both G1 and G2 in the range between &#x2013; 30 pA and 30 pA. We stimulated G1 and G2 for 150 s and let it relax for 5 850 s. The effects were estimated again as the integral of connectivity over time during the relaxation phase. The final integral of G1 connectivity is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>. The values along the diagonal are very small, because there was neither synapse reorganization nor cell assembly formation in these conditions. The remaining integrals are symmetric along the diagonal. When the discrepancy between the two populations is large, close to the two corners for example, the integral of G1 connectivity is also large. We fixed the discrepancy between the pair of stimulation intensities and compare pairs: &#x2013; 30pA and &#x2013; 10pA, &#x2013;20pA and 0pA, &#x2013; 10pA and 10pA. As shown in the white square in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, when the discrepancy is fixed to &#x2013; 20pA, the integral of &#x2013; 20pA and 0pA situation is larger than both &#x2013;30pA and &#x2013; 10pA, and &#x2013; 10pA and 10pA case. The same tendency was observed in 20pA discrepancy case. This supports the idea that network effects might influence the interaction between two groups, and that uni-group stimulation scenario achieves larger effects when stimulation is strong and focused.</p>

<title>The effect of repeated transcranial DC stimulation</title>
<p>To examine the effects of repetitive stimulation, we repeated the 2.5 pA DC stimulation in a 10&#x0025; subpopulation with different stimulation time (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) and relaxation interval (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). An example with <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x003D; 150s and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x003D; 150s is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>. Connectivity generally increases with repetition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> summarizes different ti and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> combinations. Compared to the basic condition, <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x003D; 150s, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x003D; 150s, an increase in relaxation time (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>) of 300 s led to higher connectivity than an increase in the stimulation time (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) to 300 s. Therefore, we conclude that repetitive stimulation typically increases the effect of tDCS on cell assembly connectivity. But will it keep rising or saturate eventually? To answer this question, we should simulate the repetitive 2.5 pA tDCS for a long-enough time and check if connectivity eventually saturates. This, however, requires very long simulation times. In order to avoid these long simulations, we used the most effective combination (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x003D; 150 s and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x003D; 300 s) and replaced the repetitive intensity with a stronger yet still sub-threshold DC intensity (30 pA) to achieve larger connectivity increment in each cycle and approximate the saturation level faster. After several repetitions of 30 pA stimulation, the connectivity seems to saturate at a relatively high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Different <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> combinations have slightly different saturation levels.</p>

<p>Since simple on-off repetitive stimulation could boost cell assembly formation, we wondered if replacing the relaxation phase with an opposite current stimulation would further accelerate the process. We adopted two alternating stimulation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) by applying step currents with alternating polarities (&#x00B1;2.5 pA or &#x00B1;1.25 pA) to 10&#x0025; excitatory neurons with the same stimulation interval (<italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 150 s). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> shows, after three repetitions, alternative stimulation with &#x00B1;2.5 pA accelerated the connectivity when compared to on-off stimulation. However, &#x00B1;1.25 pA alternating stimulation results in same effects as the on-off stimulation. The cell assembly connectivity after 3 repetition cycles depends on the amplitude of the stimulation pulse, but not on whether it is an on-off or alternative protocol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> summarizes the histogram (or the mean and standard deviation, plotted in the inset) of the final connectivity of 30 independent trails at the end of three repetitions, the &#x00B1;2.5 pA alternative repetition pattern achieves higher connectivity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we explored the plastic changes in network structure that could be induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We demonstrated that even relatively weak sub-threshold direct current stimulation can modulate the firing rate of a neuron that is part of an active network. This modulation can trigger network remodeling and cell assembly formation, if the network is subject to homeostatic structural plasticity. There is, in fact, strong evidence that activity-dependent network remodeling takes place in brains of all ages. We explored different parameters of tDCS stimulation with the help of our model and found that focused strong stimulation could enhance the newly formed cell assemblies. We also found that repetitive stimulation with well-chosen duty cycles could boost the induced structural changes, and repetitive stimulation with alternating sign may achieve even higher connectivity.</p>
<p>In our current study, we used connectivity as a direct readout of stimulation effects. Although there are currently no empirical data that directly demonstrate that structural changes arise as a consequence of stimulation, the factors that we found amplify its effects are not unheard of in tDCS practice. Strong focused stimulation, for example, which cor-responds to a high-definition electrode montage, does indeed lead to a stronger MEP and potentiates the therapeutic effects as compared to the conventional montage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kuo et al., 2013</xref>). Applying the same total current, the high-definition montage induces stronger electric fields in smaller brain volumes as compared to the conventional montage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>). As predicted by our model, a stronger electric field will polarize the membrane potential more, induce stronger firing rate responses and, therefore, lead to higher connectivity in the stimulated region. Moreover, a high-definition montage narrows down the affected brain region, and in our model this also contributes to higher connectivity. Repetitive stimulation, another factor predicted to boost connectivity, is already widely used in tDCS practice. As already mentioned in the Introduction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Monte-Silva et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that an interrupted 13 min - 20 min - 13 min stimulation yielded higher MEP after-effects than a single uninterrupted 26 min stimulation, while a repetition with a very long pause between stimulation episodes (13 min - 24 h - 13 min) did not accumulate the after-effects at all. The inter-stimulation interval and duty cycle does matter. In our model, the effective interval should be long enough for the system to recover its equilibrium firing rate and homeostatically respond by changing the connectivity, but not too long for the connectivity to decay to the unperturbed level again. In our simulations, we found a 1 : 2 ratio for the ON-OFF period length to be highly efficient, very similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Monte-Silva et al. (2013)</xref> reported.</p>
<p>Other computational approaches have previously been suggested to analyze the tDCS mechanism. In experiments performed both in brain slices and human subjects, the mechanistic understanding approached the level how tDCS/DCS could influence the electric activity of the brain at the single neuron level. Most notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bikson et al. (2006)</xref> has explored several very different aspects that may also contribute to tDCS function: potassium concentration, inhibitory neurons, action potential timing, and polarization of the axonal terminal. Most experimental and theoretical studies nowadays emphasize the role of excitatory neurons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Joucla and Yvert (2009)</xref> came up with the mirror estimation of membrane potential changes for large axons in the electric field, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aspart et al. (2016)</xref> conceived the influence of the electric field on neuronal dendrites as external input to the soma. Another computational approach based on modern structural brain imaging methods maps the current distribution onto the whole brain and provides answers to the question how strong the stimulation effects actually are. Spherical head models were first used to estimate the 3D current flow for any given electrode montage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miranda et al., 2006</xref>). Then fMRI based individualized modeling was employed for treating stroke and depressive patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Datta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Our current work also adopted the parameters from both experiments and estimations made by such approaches. We provide a new and original computational model to explore the plasticity at the network level, which bridges two approaches, from the level of single neurons to networks.</p>
<p>We should interpret the results and predictions of our work on network remodeling induced by tDCS with due caution. Although we know that homeostatic structural plasticity is extremely robust for a wide range of time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gallinaro and Rotter, 2018</xref>), an exact match of the plasticity dynamics has not been attempted here. Also, considering only one type of plasticity is very likely a great simplification as compared to real brain networks. As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Monte-Silva et al. (2013)</xref> in experiments, different repetitive stimulation patterns triggered either early-LTP or late-LTP like phenomena; the non-linearity of intensity dependent after-effects reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jamil et al. (2017)</xref> also suggested a more complicated interaction. Our structural plasticity rule may fit the time scale of late-LTP, but not of early-LTP. The latter often sets in right after the anodal tDCS was turned off and lasts for at least two hours post stimulation, suggesting that Hebbian plasticity on a fast time scale is also involved. Therefore, a closer look at the interplay between fast functional plasticity and slow structural plasticity will be necessary to fully understand the inner logic of stimulation after-effects. On the other hand, there are still important factors that are not at all addressed by our computational approach yet. Astrocytes, for instance, were reported to be involved in the Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> signaling and synaptic plasticity during tDCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Monai and Hirase, 2017</xref>), but this is not yet reflected in our model. Moreover, the link between cell assembly connectivity, enhanced function and changed behavior (e.g. improved cognition and/or ameliorated depressive symptoms) is far from clear. Our current work, however, could be a first step toward the goal of devising optimized tDCS protocols.</p>

<title>Network model</title>
<p>The network underneath the stimulation electrode is conceived as an inhibition-dominated recurrent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brunel, 2000</xref>), comprising 10 000 excitatory and 2 500 inhibitory neurons. All E-I, I-E, I-I connections are static and synapses have a fixed synaptic weight <italic>J<sub>E</sub></italic> or <italic>J<sub>I</sub></italic>, respectively. All these connections are randomly established, with 10&#x0025; connection probability. In contrast, E-E connections are subject to a growth rule called homeostatic structural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gallinaro and Rotter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Butz and van Ooyen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Diaz-Pier et al., 2016</xref>).

<title>Homeostatic structural plasticity</title>
<p>As pointed out before, E-I, I-E, I-I connections have static synapses with <italic>J<sub>E</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0.1 mV for excitatory synapses and <italic>J<sub>I</sub></italic> &#x003D; &#x2013;0.8mV for inhibitory synapses. E-E connections undergo continuous remodeling, governed by a firing rate based homeostatic structural plasticity rule. Excitatory synapses are formed by combining a pre-synaptic bouton and a post-synaptic spine, the so-called synaptic elements. New synapses can form only if free synaptic elements are available. Pairs of neurons can form multiple synapses between them, where each individual synapse has the same weight of <italic>J<sub>E</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0.1 mV. It has been observed in experiments that neurite growth is governed by the concentration of intracellular calcium. A specific hypothesis states that there is a set-point of the calcium concentration, which the neuron strives to reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ramakers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mattson and Kater, 1987</xref>). In the model of structural plasticity we use in our work, the growth and deletion of synaptic elements is linked to the time-dependent intracellular calcium concentration <italic>C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x003D; [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>] of the neuron in question. In fact, this variable is a good indicator of the neuron&#x2019;s firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grewe et al., 2010</xref>): Whenever the neuron generates a spike as represented by the spike train <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), the intracellular calcium concentration experiences an increase by the amount <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>Ca</sub> through calcium influx.

</disp-formula></p>
<p>The synaptic growth rule is now as follows: When the firing rate (or calcium concentration) is below its set-point, the neuron will grow new synaptic elements to compensate for the lack of input. Existing synapses are broken up and synaptic elements are added to the pool of free synaptic elements, if the firing rate is above the set-point. We adopted a liner growth rule for both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gallinaro and Rotter, 2018</xref>)
