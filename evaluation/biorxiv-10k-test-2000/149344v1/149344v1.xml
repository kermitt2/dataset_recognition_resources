<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Evidence has emerged in recent years linking insulators and the proteins that bind them to the higher order structure of animal chromatin, but the precise nature of this relationship and the manner by which insulators influence chromatin structure have remained elusive. Here we present high-resolution genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data from early <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos that allow us to map three-dimensional interactions to 500 base pairs. We observe a complex, nested pattern of regions of chromatin self-association, and use a combination of computational and manual annotation to identify boundaries between these topological associated domains (TADs). We demonstrate that, when mapped at high resolution, boundaries resemble classical insulators: short (500 - 1000 bp) genomic regions that are sensitive to DNase digestion and strongly bound by known insulator proteins. Strikingly, we show that for regions where the banding pattern of polytene chromosomes has been mapped to genomic position at comparably high resolution, there is a perfect correspondence between polytene banding and our chromatin conformation maps, with boundary insulators forming the interband regions that separate compacted bands that correspond to TADs. We propose that this precise, high-resolution relationship between insulators and TADs on the one hand and polytene bands and interbands on the other extends across the genome, and suggest a model in which the decompaction of insulator regions drives the organization of interphase chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beginning in the late 19th century, cytological investigations of the polytene chromosomes of insect salivary glands implicated the physical structure of interphase chromosomes in their cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balbiani, 1881</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Heitz &#x0026; Bauer, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">King &#x0026; Beams, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Painter, 1935</xref>). Over the next century plus, studies in the model insect species <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were instrumental in defining structural features of animal chromatin. Optical and electron microscopic analysis of fly chromosomes produced groundbreaking insights into the physical nature of genes, transcription and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belyaeva &#x0026; Zhimulev, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benyajati &#x0026; Worcel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Laird &#x0026; Chooi, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Laird, Wilkinson, Foe, &#x0026; Chooi, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McKnight &#x0026; Miller, 1976</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Vlassova et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Detailed examination of polytene chromosomes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> revealed a stereotyped organization, with compacted, DNA-rich &#x201C;bands&#x201D; alternating with extended, DNA-poor &#x201C;interband&#x201D; regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benyajati &#x0026; Worcel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bridges, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Laird &#x0026; Chooi, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lefevre, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rabinowitz, 1941</xref>), and it appears likely that this structure reflects general features of chromatin organization shared by non-polytene chromosomes. While these classical studies offered extensive structural and molecular characterization of chromosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>, the question of what was responsible for organizing chromosome structure remained unanswered.</p>
<p>A critical clue came with the discovery of insulators, DNA elements initially identified based on their ability to block the activity of transcriptional enhancers when located between an enhancer and its targeted promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Geyer &#x0026; Corces, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Holdridge &#x0026; Dorsett, 1991</xref>; Rebecca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kellum &#x0026; Schedl, 1991</xref>; R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kellum &#x0026; Schedl, 1992</xref>). Subsequent work showed that these elements could also block the spread of silenced chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kahn, Schwartz, Dellino, &#x0026; Pirrotta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Mallin, Myung, Patton, &#x0026; Geyer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Recillas-Targa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Roseman, Pirrotta, &#x0026; Geyer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sigrist &#x0026; Pirrotta, 1997</xref>) and influence the structure of chromatin. Through a combination of genetic screens and biochemical purification, a number of protein factors have been identified that bind to <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulators and modulate their function, including Su(Hw), BEAF-32, mod(mdg4), CP190, dCTCF, GAF, Zw5, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bell, West, &#x0026; Felsenfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">B&#x00FC;chner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gaszner, Vazquez, &#x0026; Schedl, 1999</xref>; Tatlana I. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerasimova, Gdula, Gerasimov, Simonova, &#x0026; Corces, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lewis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lindsley &#x0026; Grell, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Melnikova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Moon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pai, Lei, Ghosh, &#x0026; Corces, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Parkhurst et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Parkhurst &#x0026; Corces, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Scott, Taubman, &#x0026; Geyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Spana, Harrison, &#x0026; Corces, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhao, Hart, &#x0026; Laemmli, 1995</xref>). Except for CTCF, which is found throughout bilateria, all of these proteins appear to be specific to arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Heger, George, &#x0026; Wiehe, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Staining of polytene chromosomes with antibodies against such insulator proteins showed that many of them localize to polytene interbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Belyaeva &#x0026; Zhimulev, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berkaeva, Demakov, Schwartz, &#x0026; Zhimulev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrd &#x0026; Corces, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eggert, Gortchakov, &#x0026; Saumweber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gilbert, Tan, &#x0026; Hart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gortchakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">T. Yu Vatolina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhao et al., 1995</xref>), with some enriched at interband borders. Further, some, though not all, insulator protein mutants disrupt polytene chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Roy, Gilbert, &#x0026; Hart, 2007</xref>). Together, these data implicate insulator proteins, and the elements they bind, in the organization of the three-dimensional structure of fly chromosomes.</p>
<p>Several high-throughput methods to probe three-dimensional structure of chromatin have been developed in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beagrie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Principle among these are derivatives of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dekker, Rippe, Dekker, &#x0026; Kleckner, 2002</xref>), including the genome-wide &#x201C;Hi-C&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). Several groups have performed Hi-C on <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues or cells and have shown that fly chromosomes, like those of other species, are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs), regions within which loci show enriched 3C linkages with each other but depleted linkages with loci outside the domain. Disruption of TAD structures by gene editing in mammalian cells has been shown to disrupt enhancer-promoter interactions and significantly alter transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Lupi&#x00E1;&#x00F1;ez et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Although TADs appear to be a ubiquitous feature of animal genomes, the extent to which TAD structures are a general property of a genome or if they are regulated as a means to control genome function remains unclear, and the question of how TAD structures are established remains open. Previous studies have implicated a number of features in the formation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TAD boundaries, including transcriptional activity and gene density, and have reached differing conclusions about the role played by insulator protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hou, Li, Qin, &#x0026; Corces, 2012</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Ulianov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Van Bortle et al., 2014</xref>). Tantalizingly, Eagen et al., using 15 kb resolution Hi-C data from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have shown that there is a correspondence between the distribution of large TADs and polytene bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eagen, Hartl, &#x0026; Kornberg, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We have been studying the formation of chromatin structure in the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo because of its potential impact on the establishment of patterned transcription during the initial stages of development. We have previously has shown that regions of &#x201C;open&#x201D; chromatin are established at enhancers and promoters prior to the onset of transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Harrison, Li, Kaplan, Botchan, &#x0026; Eisen, 2011</xref>; X.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Li, Harrison, Villalta, Kaplan, &#x0026; Eisen, 2014</xref>) and were interested the extent to which chromatin exhibited associated three-dimensional structures before, during and after transcriptional activation. We were further interested in investigating the role chromatin structure plays in spatial patterning.</p>
<p>We therefore generated high-resolution Hi-C datasets derived from two timepoints during early <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryonic development, and from the anterior and posterior halves of hand-dissected embryos. Echoing recent results from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hug, Grimaldi, Kruse, &#x0026; Vaquerizas, 2017</xref>) we find that extensive chromatin structure emerges around the onset of zygotic genome activation. We show that high-resolution chromatin maps of anterior and posterior halves are nearly identical, suggesting that chromatin structure neither drives nor directly reflects spatially patterned transcriptional activity. However we show that stable long-range contacts evident in our chromatin maps generally involve known patterning genes, implicating chromatin conformation in transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>To investigate the origins of three-dimensional chromatin structure, we carefully map the locations of the boundaries between topological domains using a combination of manual and computational annotation. We demonstrate that these boundaries resemble classical insulators: short (500 - 1000 bp) genomic regions that are strongly bound by (usually multiple) insulator proteins and are sensitive to DNase digestion. We show that for a region in which the fine polytene banding pattern has been mapped to genomic positions, these boundary insulators correspond perfectly to interband regions that separate compacted bands corresponding to TADs. We propose that this precise, high-resolution relationship between insulators, TADs and polytene bands and interbands extends across the genome, and suggest a model in which the decompaction of insulator regions drives the organization of interphase chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.</p>

<sec id="s2"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Data quality and general features</title>
<p>We prepared and sequenced <italic>in situ</italic> Hi-C libraries from two biological replicates each of hand-sorted cellular blastoderm (mitotic cycle 14; mid-stage 5) and pre-blastoderm (mitotic cycle 12) embryos using a modestly adapted version of the protocol described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). To examine possible links between chromatin maps and transcription, we sectioned hand-sorted mitotic cycle 14 embryos along the anteroposterior midline, and generated Hi-C data from the anterior and posterior halves separately, also in duplicate. In total, we produced &#x007E;288 million informative read pairs (see <bold>Tables S1</bold> and <bold>S2</bold>).</p>
<p>We assessed the quality of these data using metrics similar to those described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the strand orientations of our reads were approximately equal in each sample (as expected from correct Hi-C libraries but not background genomic sequence; see <bold>Table S2</bold>), the signal decay with genomic distance was similar across samples, and, critically, visual inspection of heat maps prepared at a variety of resolutions showed these samples to be very similar both to each other and to previously published data prepared using similar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). We conclude that these Hi-C are of high quality and reproducibility.</p>
<p>We next sought to ascertain the general features of the data at low resolution. We examined heatmaps for all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> chromosomes together using 100 kb bins, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>. Several features of the data are immediately apparent. The prominent &#x201C;X&#x201D; patterns for chromosomes 2 and 3, which indicate an enrichment of linkages between chromosome arms, reflects the known organization of fly chromosomes during early development known as the Rabl configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Csink &#x0026; Henikoff, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">G. Wilkie A Shermoen P. O&#x2019;Farrell, 1999</xref>): telomeres are located on one side of the nucleus, centromeres are located on the opposite side, and chromosome arms are arranged roughly linearly between them. Centromeres and the predominantly heterochromatic chromosome 4 cluster together, as, to a lesser extent, do telomeres, reflecting established cytological features that have been detected by prior Hi-C analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lowenstein, Goddard, &#x0026; Sedat, 2004</xref>). These features were evident in all replicates, further confirming both that these datasets are reproducible and that they capture known features of chromatin topology and nuclear arrangement.

<sec id="s2b"><title>TAD boundaries are short elements bound by insulator proteins</title>
<p>Because we used a 4-cutter restriction enzyme and deep sequencing, and because the fly genome is comparatively small, we were able to resolve features at resolutions below one kilobase. We visually inspected genome-wide maps constructed using bins of 500bp, and were able to see a conspicuous pattern of TADs across a wide range of sizes, some smaller than 5 kb (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). When we compared maps for several of these regions with available functional genomic data from embryos, we observed that the boundaries between these domains were formed by short regions of (500-1000 bp) that are nearly always associated with high chromatin accessibility, measured by DNase-seq (X.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Li et al., 2011</xref>), and strong occupancy by known insulator proteins as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">N&#x00E8;gre et al., 2010</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref></bold>), all properties of classical insulator elements.
<fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><title>Example region of Hi-C data at 500 bp resolution.</title><p>Heat map of aggregate Hi-C data for all nc14 datasets binned at 500 bp is shown for the region located at chr2R:5,011,766-5,111,107. Raw counts were normalized by the vanilla coverage method, the logarithm was taken, and minimum and maximum values were adjusted for visual contrast. A UCSC browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kent et al., 2002</xref>) window for the corresponding coordinates is shown with tracks for Hi-C directionality (calculated from the Hi-C data shown in the heatmap), DNase accessibility (X.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Li et al., 2011</xref>), RNA polII and TFIIB (X. Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Li et al., 2008</xref>), and the insulator proteins CP190, BEAF-32, dCTCF, GAF, mod(mdg4), and Su(Hw) from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">N&#x00E8;gre et al., 2010</xref>). Dashed red lines are visual guides and are manually drawn at locations of apparent boundaries; they do not reflect algorithmically or unbiased hand-curated boundary calls. Additional identically prepared example regions are shown in <bold>Figure S1</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="149344_fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To confirm this visually striking association, we systematically called TAD boundaries by visual inspection of panels of raw Hi-C data covering the entire genome. Critically, these boundary calls were made from Hi-C data alone, and the human caller lacked any information about the regions being examined, including which region (or chromosome) was represented by a given panel. In total, we manually called 3,524 boundaries in the genome for stage 5 embryos. Taking into account the ambiguity associated with intrinsically noisy data, the difficulty of resolving small domains, and the invisibility of sections of the genome due to repeat content or a lack of MboI cut sites, we consider 3,500-5,000 to be a reasonable estimate for the number of boundaries in the genome.</p>
<p>To complement these manual calls, we developed a computational approach for calling boundaries that is similar to methods used by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, we assigned a directionality score to each genomic bin based on the number of Hi-C reads linking the bin to upstream versus downstream regions, and then used a set of heuristics to identify points of transition between regions of upstream and downstream bias. We adjusted the parameters of the directionality score and the boundary calling to account for features of the fly genome, specifically the relatively small size of many topological domains. Of our top 1000 domain boundaries identified by this approach, 937 were matched by a manually-called boundary within 1 kb, which suggested that this approach robustly identified the domain features that are apparent by eye.</p>
<p>Comparing these 937 high-confidence boundaries to other genomic datasets shows a highly stereotyped pattern of associated genomic features. Most strikingly, boundaries are enriched for the binding of the known insulator proteins CP190, BEAF-32, mod(mdg4), dCTCF, and to a lesser extent GAF and Su(Hw) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). CP190 and BEAF-32 show the strongest enrichment, and indeed, virtually all of the examined boundaries feature proximal CP190 peaks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref></bold>). Domains of H3K27 trimethylation, a marker of polycomb silencing, showed a strong tendency to terminate at boundaries, and the enhancer mark H3K4me1 showed an interesting pattern of depletion at boundaries but enrichment immediately adjacent to boundary locations (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). Boundaries also exhibit peaks of DNase accessibility and nucleosome depletion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), as well as marks associated with promoters, including the general transcription factors TFIIB and the histone tail modification H3K4me3. Despite the presence of promoter marks, we find that RNA polII is present at only a subset of stage 5 boundaries (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref></bold>).

Rows for this plot were sorted by calculating the total H3K27me3 signal in the 50 kb windows upstream and downstream of the boundary and then sorting, top to bottom: upstream signal above median and downstream signal below the median, upstream below and downstream above, upstream and downstream both above, upstream and downstream both below the median.

<p>It has previously been noted by multiple authors that insulator proteins tend to bind near promoters, specifically between divergent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">N&#x00E8;gre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Ramirez et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we find that boundary elements, as identified from Hi-C, are often found proximal to promoters and show a general enrichment of promoter-associated marks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). We wondered whether some of the enrichments we observe were marks of promoters, and were not specific features of topological boundaries. We therefore examined the distributions of the same genomic features around the top 1000 peaks of H3K4me3, a marker of active promoters, in data from stage 5 embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref></bold>) (X.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Li et al., 2014</xref>). While these sites show enrichments for insulator proteins, these enrichments are substantially weaker than those observed at topological boundaries, while RNA polII enrichment is much stronger at promoters than boundaries. The tendency for polycomb domains to terminate at promoters is also much less pronounced at promoters than boundaries. Additionally, Hug et al. pharmacologically inhibited transcription in early embryos and found that TAD structure was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hug et al., 2017</xref>). While we cannot rule out any role for promoter-bound transcription machinery in the formation of topological boundaries, we think it is unlikely that transcriptional activity is responsible for establishing topological domains.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the presence of these features was predictive of topological boundaries. We plotted the distribution of Hi-C directionality scores around peaks of these features and observed that insulator proteins, DNase accessibility peaks, and H3K4me3 peaks are all clearly associated with directionality changes used to define boundaries (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). Further, we performed logistic regression individually on each feature to assess how well it predicted the location of boundaries. The results closely matched the enrichment analysis, with CP190, BEAF-32, mod(mdg4), and dCTCF as the four most predictive features, in order (<bold>Table S3</bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the sequence composition of boundary elements by comparing the frequency of DNA words of up to seven base pairs in the set of high confidence boundaries to flanking sequence. The most enriched sequences correspond to the known binding site of BEAF-32 and to a CACA-rich motif previously identified as enriched in regions bound by CP190 (N&#x00E9;gre et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yang &#x0026; Corces, 2012</xref>), both of which show strong association with the set of boundary sequences as a whole (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>These analyses indicate that the boundaries between topological domains identified from Hi-C data map to short regions of open chromatin that are strongly bound by insulator proteins, and, conversely, that sites of insulator protein binding are strongly associated with boundaries in Hi-C data. Thus we conclude that the concepts of TAD boundaries and insulators describe a largely overlapping set of genetic elements, and, in general, can be considered equivalent.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Boundary elements correspond to polytene interbands</title>
<p>The identification of these boundary elements led us to consider the physical basis of topological domain separation. Chromosome conformation capture is a complex assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gavrilov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gavrilov, Razin, &#x0026; Cavalli, 2015</xref>), and inferring discrete physical states of the chromatin fiber from Hi-C signals generally requires orthogonal experimental data. To address this problem, we sought to leverage information from polytene chromosomes to draw associations between features of Hi-C data and physical features of chromosomes.</p>
<p>There is surprisingly little data mapping features of polytene structure to specific genomic coordinates at high resolution. Vatolina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Tatyana Yu Vatolina et al., 2011</xref>) used exquisitely careful electron microscopy to identify the fine banding pattern of the 65 kb region between polytene bands 10A1-2 and 10B1-2, revealing that this region, which appears as a single interband under a light microscope, actually contains six discrete, faint bands and seven interbands. The region is flanked by two large bands, whose genomic locations has been previously mapped and refined by FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Tatyana Yu Vatolina et al., 2011</xref>). Vatolina et al. then used available molecular genomic data to propose a fine mapping of these bands and interbands to genomic coordinates.</p>
<p><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> shows the correspondence between Vatolina et al.&#x2019;s proposed polytene map from this region and our high-resolution Hi-C data, along with measures of early embryonic DNase hypersensitivity from (X.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Li et al., 2011</xref>) and the binding of six insulator proteins (N&#x00E9;gre et al., 2010). Strikingly, there is a near-perfect correspondence between the assignments of Vatolina et al. and our Hi-C data: bands correspond to TADs, and interbands correspond to the boundary elements that separate the TADs. To some extent this is unsurprising given that we showed above that inter-TAD regions are strongly bound by insulator proteins, and Vatolina et al. relied on insulator binding in their proposed mapping. However, the overall architecture of both TADs and polytene bands in this region are highly similar, with the same number of TADs and bands, and variation in TAD size corresponding to variation in band intensity.

<p>The 5&#x2019; region of the <italic>Notch</italic> gene has also been carefully mapped. Rykowski et al. used high-resolution <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to determine that the coding sequences of <italic>Notch</italic> lies within polytene band 3C7, while the sequences upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) lie in the 3C6-7 interband. Examining the <italic>Notch</italic> locus in our Hi-C data, we see that the gene body is located within an &#x007E;20 kb TAD, and the TSS directly abuts a TAD boundary that is strongly bound by CP190 and dCTCF (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig. S7</xref></bold>), an arrangement consistent with the correspondence of boundaries and interbands.</p>
<p>Eagen et al. previously identified a broad correspondence between polytene interbands and inter-TAD regions from Hi-C data at 15 kb resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>). At sub-kilobase resolution, Hi-C data allows the detection of fine structure within these inter-TAD regions, down to individual boundary elements. The precise correspondence between boundary elements and polytene interbands suggested by a comparison of our data and the proposed polytene map of Vatolina et al has not, to our knowledge, been described previously.</p>
<p>The association between boundary elements and interbands suggests a simple model for insulator function. A key feature that distinguishes polytene interbands from bands is their low compaction ratio: they span a larger physical distance per base pair. The association between insulator binding and genomic regions with low compaction ratios suggests insulators may function by simply increasing the physical distance between adjacent domains via the unpacking and extension of intervening chromatin. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> (top) shows a representation of the conversion of genomic distance to physical distance for the 10A region, as measured by Vatolina et al. Any model for insulator function must explain several features of insulator function, including the ability to organize chromatin into physical domains, block interactions between enhancers and promoters exclusively when inserted between them, and protect transgenes from position effect variegation and block the spread of chromatin silencing states. This chromatin extension model for insulator function can explain these defining characteristics via simple physical separation.

<sec id="s2d"><title>Topological boundaries are identical in anterior and posterior sections of the embryo</title>
<p>We next asked whether the boundaries we identified as boundary elements represent constitutive features of chromatin organization or whether their function might be regulated in a cell-type specific or developmental manner. We reasoned that, since different sets of patterning genes are transcribed in the anterior and posterior portions of the pre-gastrula <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos, a comparison of chromatin interaction maps between anterior and posterior regions would reveal whether context, especially transcriptional state, affects the TAD/boundary structure of the genome. To this end, we performed two separate biological replicates of an experiment in which we sectioned several hundred mid stage 5 embryos along the anteroposterior midline, and produced deep-sequenced Hi-C libraries from the anterior and posterior halves in parallel.</p>
<p>Resulting Hi-C signals at boundaries are virtually identical in the two halves, despite substantially different gene expression profiles in these two embryonic regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). Indeed, overall Hi-C signals are remarkably similar, with anterior and posterior samples correlating as strongly as replicates. Examination of individual loci at high resolution reveal consistent profiles and boundaries, notably including genes expressed differentially in the anterior or posterior (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>).

<p>The correspondence of insulator boundary elements and interbands, and the chromatin extension model, implies that the chromatin accessibility of insulator regions will be a useful proxy for their functionality in structurally organizing the genome. Intriguingly, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Van Bortle et al., 2014</xref>) found that DNase accessibility of insulator protein-bound regions tracked with the ability of these sequences to block enhancer-promoter interactions in a cell-culture assay. We again sectioned embryos into anterior and posterior halves and performed ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buenrostro, Giresi, Zaba, Chang, &#x0026; Greenleaf, 2013</xref>) on pools of 20 embryo halves. ATAC-seq is a technique in which intact chromatin is treated with Tn5 transposase loaded with designed DNA sequences which are preferentially inserted into open, accessible chromatin regions. These insertions can be used to generate high-throughput sequencing libraries, producing data that is largely analogous to DNase-seq data. Analysis of ATAC-seq signal at insulator boundary elements in anterior and posterior halves showed that these elements have nearly identical accessibility in these two samples (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Additionally, DNase-seq data from later embryonic stages that feature substantial tissue differentiation, transcription, and chromatin changes show highly consistent profiles at boundaries (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5</xref>)</bold>. These results are consistent with a model in which insulator-mediated chromatin organization is a constitutive feature of interphase chromatin of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos.</p>

<sec id="s2e"><title>Topological boundaries begin to emerge before zygotic genome activation</title>
<p>The chromatin landscape of the early fly embryo is known to change dramatically upon the onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the period approximately two hours into development in which the zygotic genome switches from a largely silent state to actively transcribing thousands of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Foe &#x0026; Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hug et al., 2017</xref>; X.-Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McKnight &#x0026; Miller, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Newport &#x0026; Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Tadros &#x0026; Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). We asked whether the boundary effects we observed in stage 5 embryos were present in nuclei before ZGA. To address this, we prepared Hi-C libraries from two biological replicates of whole embryos hand-staged at nuclear cycle 12. Hug et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hug et al., 2017</xref>) recently used a similar Hi-C dataset to show that chromatin structure is largely featureless prior to ZGA and adopts complex structure only after ZGA onset. We observed a similar transition between nc12 and stage 5 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>, compare with <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). At individual insulator elements, we see that transitions in the directionality of Hi-C data is present but substantially weaker than in stage 5 embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). A simple explanation for this data is that the establishment of decompacted boundary domains occurs on a time scale such that they are present in only a fraction of nuclei in our nc12 samples, which are not sorted to isolate a specific time points but rather are distributed randomly through the 15 minute nc12 interphase. Blythe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blythe &#x0026; Wieschaus, 2016</xref>) performed ATAC-seq on early embryos staged precisely at three minute intervals and reported that chromatin containing insulators generally only opens late in the nuclear cycles. It is therefore likely that the components necessary for insulator boundary establishment are present and active in the early embryo, but are prevented by the rapid nuclear cycles of cleavage stage fly embryos from generating decompacted domains until the end of the longer interphase periods of the later nuclear cycles.

<p>Many models of insulator function invoke physical contact between insulators to form &#x201C;looped&#x201D; chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fujioka, Wu, &#x0026; Jaynes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kravchenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kyrchanova &#x0026; Georgiev, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Yang &#x0026; Corces, 2012</xref>), and a substantial literature exists demonstrating that many insulator proteins are able to interact with each other and to self-associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blanton, Gaszner, &#x0026; Schedl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">B&#x00FC;chner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gause, Morcillo, &#x0026; Dorsett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ghosh, Gerasimova, &#x0026; Corces, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Golovnin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Mohan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Vogelmann et al., 2014</xref>). In general, we do not observe looping interactions between domain boundaries in our Hi-C data. However, visual inspection of heat maps of Hi-C data for the entire genome identified 36 examples of interactions between non-adjacent domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6"><bold>Fig. S6</bold></xref>, <bold>Table S4</bold>), in addition to the previously noted clustering of PcG-regulated Hox gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

</p>
<p>Curiously, we detected a similar situation on the other side of <italic>Scr</italic>, where a domain containing the hox gene <italic>Dfd</italic> is &#x201C;skipped&#x201D; over by the <italic>Ama</italic> locus to interact with a short element 3&#x2019; of the <italic>Scr</italic> transcription unit (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref></bold>).

In these cases, a plausible topology is that the skipped domain is &#x201C;looped out&#x201D;, preventing interaction with neighbors, while the adjacent domains are brought into proximity.</p>
<p>In addition to these domain-skipping events, we observe a small number of looping interactions, where two distal loci show high levels of interaction, without the associated enriched interactions between the domains flanking the loop. In every case we observe, the loop forms between two domain boundaries. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref></bold>, one of these loops brings together the promoters of <italic>kni</italic> and the related <italic>knrl</italic> genes. Other loops connect the <italic>achaete</italic> and <italic>scute</italic> genes, <italic>slp1</italic> and <italic>slp2</italic>, and the promoter of <italic>Ubx</italic> with an element in its first intron (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>These loci demonstrate that looping and domain-skipping events can be detected in our Hi-C data, but it appears that such interactions are rare and that looping does not occur between the overwhelming majority of insulator boundary elements. Nevertheless, it is striking that of the limited number of distal interactions we observed, many of them involve genes that are transcriptionally active during stage 5 of embryogenesis. This raises the possibility that these interactions may be stage or tissue-specific regulatory phenomena, and that more may be present in other tissues, developmental time points, or conditions.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>While several Hi-C studies in flies have identified enrichments of insulator proteins at TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Mourad &#x0026; Cuvier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Ulianov et al., 2015</xref>), none explicitly mapped boundaries to the discrete insulator elements we have identified. This is likely explained by limitations in resolution due to sequencing depth, restriction enzyme cut site frequency, or analysis routines. A common feature that we observe in our Hi-C maps is the presence of large (up to hundreds of kb) TADs characterized by inaccessible chromatin and the presence of few genes. When viewed at lower resolution, these would be the only TADs detected, with intervening regions characterized by clusters of insulator protein binding, transcription, and open chromatin. This closely matches prior descriptions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin topology. By examining these &#x201C;inter-TAD&#x201D; regions at exceptionally high-resolution, we were able to show that they in fact consist of series of smaller TADs, and that the boundaries of both large and small TADs are defined by a common class of insulator elements.</p>
<p>Our most intriguing finding is the association of TAD boundaries with polytene interbands. The implication that these elements are decompacted, extended chromatin regions provides an attractive model in which simple physical separation explains multiple activities associated with insulators, including the ability to block enhancer-promoter interactions, prevent the spread of silenced chromatin, and organize chromatin structure.</p>
<p>A number of prior observations are consistent with the identity of insulators/boundaries as interbands. First, estimates suggest that there are &#x007E;5000 interbands constituting 5&#x0025; of genomic DNA, with an average length of 2 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tatyana Yu Vatolina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhimulev, 1996</xref>), numbers that are in line with our estimates of boundary element length and number. Second, interbands are associated with insulator proteins, with CP190 appearing to be a constitutive feature of all or nearly all interbands (Tatiana I. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gerasimova, Lei, Bushey, &#x0026; Corces, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Pai et al., 2004</xref>), which is precisely what we observe for boundary elements. Third, interbands and boundary elements are highly sensitive to DNase digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">T. Yu Vatolina et al., 2011</xref>). Fourth, interbands have been shown to contain the promoters and 5&#x2019; ends of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jamrich, Greenleaf, &#x0026; Bautz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Rykowski, Parmelee, Agard, &#x0026; Sedat, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">H.

Sass &#x0026; Bautz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Heinz Sass &#x0026; Bautz, 1982</xref>), and we see a strong enrichment for promoters oriented to transcribe away from boundaries, which would place upstream regulatory elements within or near the interband. Finally, deletion of both isoforms of BEAF-32, the second-most highly enriched insulator protein at boundary elements, results in polytene X chromosomes that exhibit loss of banding and are wider and shorter than wild type, consistent with a loss of decompacted BEAF-32- bound regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that interbands in polytene chromosomes result from multiple underlying molecular phenomena, but we believe it is likely that decompacted insulator elements constitute a significant fraction of these structures.</p>
<p>While we and others have not observed frequent looping of insulators in Hi-C data from fly tissue, our model of chromatin compaction at insulators is not mutually exclusive with a role for looping in the function of some insulators. Indeed, we have observed a limited set of cases in which interactions between boundaries seem to organize special genome structures with, at least in the case of the <italic>Scr</italic> locus, clear functional implications. It is likely that additional boundary-associated distal interactions will be found in other tissues and stages of fly development. However, we emphasize that these interactions are exceedingly rare and do not appear to be general features of the function of boundary elements.</p>

<sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The data presented here offer a picture of the structure of the interphase chromatin of <italic>Drosophila</italic> that unifies years of studies of polytene chromosomes with modern genomic methods. In this picture, interphase chromatin consists of alternating stretches of compacted, folded chromatin domains separated by regions of decompacted, stretched regions. The compacted regions vary in size from a few to hundreds of kilobases and correspond to both polytene band regions and TADs in Hi-C data. Decompacted regions that separate these domains are short DNA elements that are defined by the strong binding of insulator proteins and correspond to polytene interbands and TAD boundaries (insulators). An intuitive view of this structure in a non-polytene context might resemble the well-worn &#x201C;beads on a string&#x201D;, in which insulator/interband regions are the string and bands/TADs form beads of various sizes. Future work, including experimental manipulation of the sequences underlying these structures, will focus on validating and refining this model and understanding its implications for genome function.</p>

<sec id="s5a"><title>Embryo collection, sorting, and sectioning</title>
<p>OregonR strain <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos were collected on molasses plates seeded with fresh yeast paste from a population cage and aged to appropriate developmental stages, all at 25 C. Embryos were washed into nitex meshes, dechorionated by treatment with dilute bleach for 2 minutes, dipped briefly (15-20 s) in isopropanol, and gently rocked in fixative solution of (76.5&#x0025; hexanes, 5&#x0025; formaldehyde in 1x PBS) for 28-30 minutes. Embryos were then thoroughly washed in PBS with 0.5&#x0025; triton and stored for no more than 3 days at 4 C. For sample HiC-2/4, embryos were inspected under a light microscope to confirm that the vast majority corresponded to early cellularized blastoderm, and approximately 4000 embryos were used in the Hi-C protocol. For samples HiC-8, 10, 11, 12, 13-16, fixed embryos were hand-sorted under a light microscope as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>), using morphological markers to identify early cellularized embryos (nc14, stage 5) or nc12 embryos. For whole embryo experiments, sorted embryos were placed directly into the Hi-C protocol, with no more than 3 days having elapsed since fixation.</p>
<p>For sectioned embryos, hand-sorted embryos of precise developmental stages were first arranged in rows on a block of 1&#x0025; agarose with bromophenol blue in a shared anterior-posterior orientation, with between 20-40 embryos per block. Aligned embryos were then transferred to the bottom of a plastic embedding mold (Sigma Aldrich E6032), the bottom of which had previously been coated with hexane glue, carefully keeping track of the anterior-posterior orientation of embryos by marking the cup with marker. Embryos were covered with clear frozen section compound (VWR 95057- 838) and frozen at &#x2212;80C for up to two months. Frozen blocks were retrieved from the freezer and embryos rapidly sliced at approximately the mid-point by hand using a standard razor blade under a dissecting microscope. Anterior and posterior halves were separately transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing &#x007E;200 &#x03BC;L PBS with 0.5&#x0025; triton using an embryo pick (a tool of mysterious provenance that appears to be a clay sculpting tool). Successful transfer was confirmed visually by the presence of blue embryos which had absorbed bromophenol blue from the agarose block. Between transferring anterior and posterior halves, the pick was washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, and rubbed vigorously with kimwipes. We note that anterior and posterior half samples are precisely matched: samples HiC-13 and 14 contain the anterior and posterior halves (respectively) of the same embryos, and the same is true for HiC-15 and 16.</p>

<sec id="s6a"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Hi-C experiments were conducted as described in Rao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>), with slight modifications. For completeness, we describe the detailed protocol: Embryos (or halves) were suspended in 1X NEB2 buffer (NEB B7002) and homogenized on ice by douncing for several minutes each with the loose and tight dounces. Insoluble material (including nuclei) was pelleted by spinning for 5 minutes at 4500 x g in microcentrifuge cooled to 4 C (all wash steps used these conditions for pelleting). Nuclei were washed twice with 500 &#x03BC;L of 1x NEB2 buffer and then suspended in 125 &#x03BC;L of the same. 42.5 &#x03BC;L of 2&#x0025; SDS was added and tubes are placed at 65 C for 10 minutes, then returned to ice, followed by addition of 275 &#x03BC;L of 1x NEB2 buffer and 22 &#x03BC;L of 20&#x0025; Triton X-100, then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Samples were digested overnight with 1500 units of MboI by shaking at 37 C. The next day, samples were washed twice with 1X NEB2, resuspended in 100 &#x03BC;L 1X NEB2, and 15 &#x03BC;L of fill-in mix (1.5 &#x03BC;L 10x NEB2, 0.4 &#x03BC;L each of 10 mM dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 9 &#x03BC;L 0.4 mM biotin-14-dCTP, 2.5 &#x03BC;L 5 U/&#x03BC;L Klenow (NEB M0210), 1 &#x03BC;L water) was added, followed by 1.5 hours at 37 C. Samples were then washed twice with 500 &#x03BC;L 1X ligation buffer (10X: 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH7.4, 0.1M MgCl2, 0.1M DTT), resuspended in 135 &#x03BC;L of the same, then supplemented with 250 &#x03BC;L of ligation mix (25 &#x03BC;L 10x ligation buffer, 25 &#x03BC;L 10&#x0025; Triton X-100, 2.6 &#x03BC;L 10 mg/ml BSA, 2.6 &#x03BC;L 100 mM ATP, 196 &#x03BC;L water) and 2000 units of T4 DNA ligase (NEB M0202T) and incubated for 2 hours (or overnight) at room temperature. An additional 2000 units of ligase were added, followed by another 2 hours at room temperature. Cross-link reversal was carried out by adding 50 &#x03BC;L of 20 mg/mL proteinase K and incubating overnight at 65 C. An additional 50 &#x03BC;L proteinase K was then added followed by a 2 hour 65 C incubation. 0.1 volumes of 3M NaCl and 2 &#x03BC;L of glycoblue (Thermo Fisher AM9515) were added, then samples were extracted once with one volume of phenol pH 7.9, once with phenol-chloroform pH7.9, then precipitated with 3 volumes of EtOH. Washed pellets were resuspended in 130 &#x03BC;L water and treated with 1 &#x03BC;L of RNase A for 15 minutes at 37 C. DNA was fragmented using the Covaris instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA) with peak power 140.0, duty factor 10.0, cycles/burst 200 for 80 seconds. Samples are brought to 300 &#x03BC;L total volume with water.</p>
<p>75 &#x03BC;L of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher 65001) were washed twice with 400 &#x03BC;L of tween wash buffer (TWB) (2X binding buffer [BB]: 100 &#x03BC;L of 1M Tris-HCl pH8, 20 &#x03BC;L 0.5 M EDTA, 4 mL of 5M NaCl, 5.88 mL water; TWB: 5 ml 2X binding buffer, 50 &#x03BC;L 10&#x0025; Tween, 4.95 &#x03BC;L water), resuspended in 300 &#x03BC;L 2X BB, then added to 300 &#x03BC;L DNA. Samples were rocked at room temperature for 15 minutes, then washed once with TWB, twice with 1X BB, reclaimed on magnetic stand and resuspended in 100 &#x03BC;L 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer. Samples were then supplemented with end-repair mix (78 &#x03BC;L water, 10 &#x03BC;L 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer with ATP, 2 &#x03BC;L 25 mM dNTPs, 1 &#x03BC;L 10U/&#x03BC;L T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher EK0031), 2 &#x03BC;L 5U/&#x03BC;L Klenow, 3 &#x03BC;L 3U/&#x03BC;L T4 DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher EP0061)), incubated 30 minutes at room temp, washed as before, washed once with 100 &#x03BC;L 1X NEB2, and resuspended in 90 &#x03BC;L 1X NEB2. dA overhangs were added by adding 2 &#x03BC;L 10mM dATP and 1 &#x03BC;L Klenow exo minus (NEB M0212S), incubating at 37 C for 30 minutes. Beads were washed as before, washed once with 100 &#x03BC;L 1X Quickligase (NEB M2200S) buffer, resuspended in 50 &#x03BC;L 1X Quickligase buffer, then supplemented with 3 &#x03BC;L Illumina adaptors and 1 &#x03BC;L Quickligase. Samples were incubated 15 minutes at room temperature, then were twice with TWB, twice with 1X BB, twice with 200 &#x03BC;L TLE, and resuspend in 50 &#x03BC;L TLE. Beads are stable at 4 C, but were always amplified quickly. 100 &#x03BC;L (or more) of phusion PCR reaction was prepared (50 &#x03BC;L 2X Phusion master mix, 1 &#x03BC;L 100 &#x03BC;M forward primer [5- AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAG-3], 1 &#x03BC;L 100 &#x03BC;M reverse primer [5-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAG-3], 10 &#x03BC;L of beads with Hi-C library attached, 38 &#x03BC;L water). Reaction was mixed well and split into separate 12 &#x03BC;L reactions. Thermocycler conditions were 16 cycles of 98 C for 30 s, 63 C for 30 s, 72 C for 2 m. Reactions were pooled and loaded on a 2&#x0025; agarose gel. Fragments corresponding to an insert size of &#x007E;300 bp (amplicon size of 421 bp) were excised from the gel, purified with the Zymo Gel DNA Recovery Kit (D4001T, Zymo), and submitted for sequencing at the Vincent J. Coates Genomic Sequencing Laboratory (Berkeley, CA).</p>

<sec id="s6b"><title>Read processing and mapping</title>
<p>Our analysis routine was adapted by examining the approaches of multiple groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>) in addition to procedures we developed independently. All analysis was performed with custom Python, R, and Perl scripts except where noted. Single-ends of demultiplexed reads were separately mapped using Bowtie (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Langmead, Trapnell, Pop, &#x0026; Salzberg, 2009</xref>) (parameters: -m1 --best --strata) to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome dm3 R5_22 downloaded from flybase on June 11, 2014. Due to the formation of chimeric reads intrinsic to the Hi-C procedure, reads can fail to properly map if the ligation junction lies within the 100 bp read. To address this, we used an iterative mapping procedure, in which we began by mapping the first 20 nt of the reads (using Bowtie&#x2019;s --trim3 feature). Unique mappings were kept, reads that failed to map were stored, and the procedure was repeated on the multiply-mapping reads, incrementing the length of sequence to map by 7 nt each round (attempt to uniquely map using first 20, first 27, first 34&#x2026;). We found that this method gave 5-10&#x0025; increases in yield of mapped reads over a procedure in which we attempted to explicitly detect and trim ligation junctions from reads. Uniquely mapping reads from all iterations were collated as a single file.</p>
<p>Uniquely-mapping single-ends were paired based on read identity, and only pairs with two uniquely-mapping ends were retained. Duplicate reads that shared identical left and right mapping positions were removed. Resulting paired, collapsed, uniquely mapping reads were then inspected for quality. Primary indicators of successful Hi-C libraries were the distance distribution of mapped pairs and the relative frequencies of reads in the four orientations described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Rao et al., 2014</xref>), in-in, in-out, out-in, and out-out. In all of our libraries, we detect some &#x007E;3-15&#x0025; reads that appear to be simple genomic sequence, not the result of a Hi-C ligation event. These reads are readily detected by examining the size distributions of in-out reads (the orientation expected from standard genomic sequence) compared with the other three orientations. The in-out reads have a unique hump of reads showing a distance distribution of &#x007E;150-500 bp, varying slightly from sample to sample. In-out reads pairs spanning less than 500 bp were removed from further analysis.</p>

<sec id="s6c"><title>Topological boundary detection</title>
<p>We explored a number of ways of identifying boundaries from directionality data. In the end, the most robust was to use a simple heuristic that at a boundary, by definition, regions to the left show left-bias and regions to the right show right bias. While attempts to derive a boundary score from a comparison of directionality scores upstream and downstream showed susceptibility to noise and artifacts, requiring expected upstream and downstream behavior allowed robust detection of sets of boundary elements. We describe the complete procedure below.</p>
<p>Read counts were assigned to 500 bp bins for all genomic bin combinations within 500 kb of the diagonal. Local directionality scores were calculated for each bin by summing the counts linking the bin to regions in a window encompassing the genomic regions between 1 and 15 kb from the bin (skipping the two proximal 500 bp bins, summing the next 28) upstream and downstream, then taking the log (10) ratio of downstream to upstream. These parameters were determined by visually comparing local directionality scores from a range of inputs to Hi-C heat maps for a number of genomic regions, identifying parameters in which directionality transitions reflected boundaries evident in the heat maps. We observed high levels of noise in the directionality metric in regions of low read coverage. To suppress these noisy signals, we devised a weighted local directionality score to weight these scores based on the total number of reads used in the calculation. We experimented with a variety of scaling factors a such that w = [read count]&#x005E;a and found that a weighting of a=0.5 worked well to reduce signal from low-read regions. From these directional scores, sites were first selected for which the mean directionality score of the 5 adjacent upstream bins was less than -2, and the mean for the 5 adjacent downstream bins was greater than 2. Boundary scores were assigned to resulting bins by subtracting the sum of the directionality scores for the 5 adjacent upstream bins from the 5 adjacent downstream bins. An issue with this scoring system is that bins that lack MboI sites can cause inflated directionality scores in adjacent regions. To address this, we simply assigned a boundary score of 0 to any bin with more than 1 such bin in its radius. The resulting distribution of boundary scores is dominated by series of consecutive bins with large boundary score maximums, which is uninformative since these scores are essentially derived from the same data (window shifted by one bin). We therefore merged adjacent bins that passed the cutoff and selected only the bin with the maximum boundary score within a contiguous block. By sorting the resulting table on the boundary score, we were able to select sets of candidate boundaries of various strengths for analysis.</p>
<p>In additional to these computationally-identified boundary locations, we manually called boundaries for the entire genome. An R script serially displayed Hi-C heat maps of 250 kb genomic windows and recorded the genomic coordinates of mouse clicks made at visually-identified boundaries. The human caller was unaware of any features of the regions examined other than the Hi-C maps, and was unaware of the locations being displayed in a given plot.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6e"><title>Sequence analysis</title>
<p>We used simple custom Python scripts to count the occurrences of all words of length 4, 5, 6 and 7 in 500 bp windows from 10,000 bp upstream to 10,000 bp downstream of the 500 bp window identified as a boundary. We then computed a simple enrichment score for each unique word equal to the counts of that word and its reverse complement in the boundary divided by the mean counts for the word and its reverse complement in the remaining windows. We noticed that many of the words identified as enriched in this analysis were also enriched in the 500 bp bins immediately flanking the boundary. We therefore updated our enrichment score for each word to be the mean of the counts of the word and its reverse complement in the boundary and the 500 bp bins immediately adjacent to it (three bins in total) divided by the mean counts of the word and its reverse complement in the remaining 38 bins. Counts and scores for all words are provided in the supplemental materials.</p>

<sec id="s7a"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Early nc14 embryos were placed in ATAC-seq lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) without detergent, with 5&#x0025; glycerol added. Embryos were then taken out of the freezing solution and placed onto a glass slide which was then put on dry ice for 2 minutes. Once embryos were completely frozen, the glass slide was removed and embryos were sliced with a razor blade chilled in dry ice. Once sliced embryo halves were moved to tubes containing ATAC-seq lysis buffer with 0.15mM spermine added to help stabilize chromatin. Embryo halves were then homogenized using single use plastic pestles. IGEPal CA-630 was added to a final concentration of 0.1&#x0025;. After a 10 minute incubation nuclei were spun down and resuspended in water. Twenty halves were added to the transposition reaction containing 25 &#x03BC;l of 2x TD buffer (Illumina), and 2.5ul of Tn5 enzyme (Illumina) and the reaction was incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). Transposed DNA was purified using Qiagen Minelute kit. Libraries were then amplified using phusion 2x master mix (NEB) and indexed primers from Illumina. Libraries were then purified with Ampure Beads and sequenced on the Hiseq4000 using 100 bp paired end reads.</p>
