<abstract><title>Summary</title>
<p><italic>Cis</italic>-Prenyltransferases (<italic>cis</italic>PTs) constitute a large family of enzymes conserved during evolution and present in all domains of life. In eukaryotes and archaea, <italic>cis</italic>PT is the first enzyme committed to the synthesis of dolichyl-phosphate (DolP). DolP is obligate lipid carrier in protein glycosylation reactions in mammals. The homodimeric bacterial enzyme, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS) generates 11 isoprene units and has been structurally and mechanistically characterized in great detail. Recently our group discovered that unlike UPPS, mammalian <italic>cis</italic>PT is a heteromer consisting of NgBR (NUS1) and hCIT (DHDDS) subunits and this composition has been confirmed in plants and fungal <italic>cis</italic>PTs. Here, we establish the first purification system for heteromeric <italic>cis</italic>PT and show that both NgBR and hCIT subunits function in catalysis and substrate binding. Finally, we identified a critical RxG sequence in the C&#x002D;terminal tail of NgBR that is conserved and essential for enzyme activity across phyla.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Dolichyl phosphate is an obligate lipid carrier for protein N-glycosylation, 0-mannosylation, C&#x002D;mannosylation and GPI-anchor synthesis in eukaryotic cells and undecaprenyl phosphate is essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria. <italic>cis</italic>-Prenyltransferase (<italic>cis</italic>PT) is the rate limiting enzyme committed to dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis in Eukaryotes, and Archaea as well as undecaprenyl phosphate biosynthesis in Eubacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic <italic>cis</italic>PTs belong to a large protein family, well conserved during evolution (1) and the <italic>cis</italic>PT family was identified amongst the 355 protein families that trace to the last universal common ancestor of all cells (LUCA, or the progenote) by phylogenetic criteria (3).</p>
<p>The bacterial enzyme, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS) is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes chain elongation of famesyl diphosphate (FPP) by sequential reactions with eight isopentenyl diphosphate molecules (IPP). UPPS has been structurally and mechanistically characterized in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) however, the eukaryotic enzyme has not been purified to date. Our group discovered that unlike UPPS, mammalian and fungal <italic>cis</italic>PT is heteromeric complex consisting of NgBR (Nus1) and hCIT (DHDDS) subunits in human cells and these findings were confirmed for a number of plant <italic>cis</italic>PTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) demonstrating a major difference in the composition of <italic>cis</italic>PT activity in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Moreover, loss of function mutations identified in patients via exome sequencing in either NgBR or hCIT causes a congenital glycosylation disorder, and results in severe clinical manifestations including cognitive defects and retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and microdeletions within NgBR locus are linked to pediatric epilepsy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Further phylogenetic analysis ofNgBR and UPPS suggests that a C-terminal motif important for mammalian and fungal <italic>cis</italic>PT is shared by the single subunit <italic>cis</italic>PT UPPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we have purified and characterized for the first time a heteromeric <italic>cis</italic>PT complex composed of NgBR and hCIT subunits. Biochemical characterization of purified wild&#x002D;type (WT) and various mutants of the NgBR/hCIT complex shows that both subunits contribute to catalytic activity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a conserved C-terminal motif -RxG&#x002D;motif is critical for enzyme catalysis in both two-component and single-subunit <italic>cis</italic>PTs.</p></sec>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Purification and biochemical characterization of human <italic>cis</italic>-PT</title>
<p>Although NgBR and hCIT or its orthologs are essential subunits for <italic>cis</italic>PT activity in mammals, fungi and plants, the heteromeric complex and its activity have not been isolated and purified. Thus, we developed a purification scheme to isolate the NgBR/hCIT complex (h<italic>cis</italic>PT). Optimal expression and tagging strategy was first established using a previously described expression system in a triple knockout strain lacking <italic>nus1&#x0394; rer2&#x0394; srtl &#x0394;in S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Cell survival was ensured due to expression of Gl<italic>cis</italic>PT on the <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid and cells were co-transformed with the <italic>LEU2</italic> and <italic>MET1S</italic> plasmids bearing WT or epitope tagged versions of hCIT and NgBR respectively. The yeast cells were streaked onto complete plates or synthetic complete medium containing 1&#x0025; 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Since Ura3 protein, which is expressed from the <italic>URA3</italic> marker present in the plasmids, converts FOA to toxic 5-fluorouracil, the survival of the yeast cells on the FOA plate depends on the functionality of the expressed NgBR/hCIT complex. hCIT isoform 1 (UniProtKB&#x0023; Q86SQ9-1) and isoform 2, (UniProtKB &#x0023; Q86SQ9-2), but not isoform 3 (UniProtKB&#x0023; Q86SQ9-3) supported the growth of yeast when co-expressed with NgBR in the triple delete strain (data not shown). N- terminal tagging, but not C-terminal tagging of hCIT, generated a construct indistinguishable from wild-type (WT), non-tagged hCIT in yeast. Both N&#x002D; and C- terminal tagging of NgBR reduced its stability and activity when expressed in yeast, therefore a 6-His tag was placed internally after Gly31, between the putative signal anchor and TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This tag did not affect the growth phenotype and <italic>cis</italic>PT activity in yeast co&#x002D;expressing N-terminally Strep-tagged hCIT (not shown).</p>

<p>Next, the cDNAs encoding 6xHis-NgBR and Strep-tagged-hCIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig1A</xref>) were cloned into an IRES-containing bicistronic vector allowing the simultaneous expression of two proteins separately but from the same RNA transcript. This was necessary based on our previous work demonstrating that co-translation of both subunits was required for activity in an in vitro translation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). To generate protein for purification, the construct was transiently transfected into Expi293F cells and cells collected 72 hours later by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with PBS, and lysed in detergent free buffer (Ex). To pre-fractionate cell extracts prior to affinity chromatography, crude membrane extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation, and pellet (P) solubilized by Dounce homogenization in the presence with 0.5&#x0025; Triton X100, and solubilized protein cleared by a second ultracentrifugation step (SUP). N-terminally Strep&#x002D;tagged hCIT and internally tagged 6xHis-NgBR complex was purified using a dual affinity purification scheme <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Table I).</bold> Each step of purification was monitored by Western Blotting and measurement of <italic>cis</italic>PT activity and this scheme enriched the specific activity of the enzyme 1,700 fold over the starting material. As judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining of each fraction, the hCIT/NgBR complex was approximately 95&#x0025; pure <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold> and the purified heteromeric complex ran as monodispersed peak on size exclusion chromatography <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; black line)</bold> that tracked with <italic>cis</italic>PT activity <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; dashed line)</bold>.</p>
<p>The purified hCIT/NgBR complex required Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> ions for its activity consistent with other studies of the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) with maximum activity at 0.5-2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure. 2A</xref>)</bold>. The purified enzyme had a broad pH optimum <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>)</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and was highly stable demonstrating linear <italic>cis</italic>PT activity occurred over 24hrs at 37&#x00B0;C <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>)</bold>. To test the influence of lipids on human <italic>cis</italic>PT activity, Triton X100 was removed from the enzyme preparation by buffer exchange and activity was measured upon the addition of Triton X100 or different phospholipids at concentration above their critical micellar concentration. As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref></bold>, phosphatidic acid modestly increased enzyme activity (1.8 fold) whereas other phospholipids had a marked effect in activating of the enzyme. Cardiolipin increased <italic>cis</italic>PT activity over 7 fold and phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine increased activity by approximately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref> fold suggesting that the lipid environment strongly impacts <italic>cis</italic>PT activity.</p>

<p>Sequential alignment of nonredundant homomeric <italic>cis</italic>PTs from all three domains of life together with heteromeric orthologs define the position of <italic>cis</italic>PT homology domain among NgBR orthologs <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)</bold>. Analysis of the architecture of representative <italic>cis</italic>PT homology domains revealed number of characteristic features for each of the group (single-subunit orthologs, hCIT orthologs and NgBR orthologs) separately or shared between two groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Only four of the previously identified five conserved regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) are present in all three groups. The NgBR group lacks Region II and has highly degenerate Regions I and III. Among other conserved residues, the NgBR class is missing a highly-conserved stretch of the six amino acid residues involved in FPP binding and catalysis in Region I (boxed region) found in UPPS and hCIT. Regions IV and V, including the predicted dimer interface based on the structural data obtain for the UPPS of <italic>M luteus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) are well conserved amongst all three groups. Finally, the NgBR group shares with homomeric enzymes, but not with the hCIT group, an -RxG C-terminal conserved motif (see red arrowheads)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) with G being absolutely conserved in EcUPPS and NgBR class. The R residue is substituted with N in SaUPPS and a majority of plant and fungal NgBR orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In a majority of the cases, X is any nonpolar amino acid however putative <italic>Hypocreales</italic> NgBR orthologs as well as UPPS of some <italic>Trypanosomatidae</italic> have positively charged H or R at this position. Meta-analysis of available experimental data concerning <italic>cis</italic>PTs, suggest that both the catalytic motif of Region I and the C-terminal -RxG&#x002D;motif are indispensable for enzymatic activity being part of the same subunit or separated between hCIT (catalytic motif) and NgBR (RxG) class of <italic>cisPTs</italic> proteins.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Phenotypic analysis of <italic>hcis</italic>PT mutants in yeast and biochemical characterization of purified proteins supports importance of RxG motif and position of <italic>cis</italic>PT homology domain in NgBR</title>
<p>To examine the role of the conserved RxG motif in h<italic>cis</italic>PT, and to test the predicted position of the <italic>cis</italic>PT homology domain in NgBR, we performed phenotypic analysis of a series of truncation and point mutants of NgBR or hCIT using the above mentioned yeast triple deletion strain <italic>rer2&#x0394; srt1&#x0394;</italic> and <italic>nusl&#x0394; (3)</italic>. No growth defects were observed with complexes containing NgBR<sup>H100A</sup> (His the first amino acid in Region I and is highly conserved among proteins bearing <italic>cis</italic>PT homology domain), NgBR<sup>R290H</sup> (a human mutation causing a glycosylation disorder), &#x0394;85-NgBR (truncated protein lacking first 84 amino acid including TM domain conserved across eukaryotic orthologs of NgBR) or hCIT<sup>K42E</sup> (a human mutation causing retinitis pigmentosa) in comparison to WT <italic>cis</italic>PT composed of NgBR/hCIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Essentiality of the conserved D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> in hCIT corresponding the D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) of EcUPPS was confirmed since the hCITD<sup>34A</sup>/NgBR complex did not support the growth of triple knockout yeast cells. Cells expressing truncated &#x0394;101-NgBR (lacking the first 100 amino acids) had a severe growth defect suggesting that the first conserved region in NgBR, despite its degeneration, was important for function. This finding is in line with the recent structural analysis of plant <italic>Z,Z-</italic> famesyl diphosphate synthase (zFPPS) suggesting that N-terminus might be able to extend to the active site of the neighboring monomer near the C-terminus as an important functional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>

The cells were streaked onto complete plates (YPD) or synthetic complete medium containing 1&#x0025; 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA).

<graphic xlink:href="139675_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Finally, conservation of the RxG motif was confirmed by the series of mutants leading to severe growth defects. Deletion of the C-terminal K<sup>293</sup> (NgBR<sup>292</sup>), the addition of A to NgBR (NgBR&#x002B;A<sup>294</sup>), HA tagging (NgBR-HA) or <italic>NgBRaznA</italic> substitutions all reduced growth documenting the importance of the last 4 residues in NgBR for function <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold>. Next, we compared the steady state activities of purified mutants able to support the growth of yeast to the purified WT enzyme. We did not include the N-terminal truncation variants of NgBR since introducing the epitope tag after the predicted TM1 (35-56aa) rendered the enzyme inactive in yeast. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref></bold>, all mutants analyzed displayed lower enzymatic activity compared to WT enzyme and mutations that strongly impacted growth in yeast (NgBR<sup>G292A</sup>, NgBR<sup>292</sup> and NgBR&#x002B;A<sup>294</sup>) had the lowest enzymatic activity varying co-substrates FPP and IPP <bold>(Figure 4- supplemental figure 1)</bold>. Next, the polyprenol reaction products were examined by TLC. Since the mutants had reduced activity, no products were detected on the TLC plate when equal amounts of reaction products were loaded from WT enzyme compared to the mutants, therefore an overload of products was used to examine the chain length of prenols generated from the different enzymes. As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>, WT NgBR and NgBR<sup>HlOOA</sup> generated dominant prenols of C<sub>95</sub> (19 units), disease mutants, hCIT<sup>K42E</sup> and NgBR<sup>R290H</sup> complexes generated prenols of C<sub>90</sub> (18 units) while NgBR<sup>G292A</sup> and NgBR&#x002B;A<sup>294</sup> yielded polyprenols that were one or two units shorter. This data support the important role of C-terminus, in particular G<sup>292</sup> in <italic>cis</italic>PT activity.</p>
<p>To further characterize h<italic>cis</italic>PT and elucidate the impact of mutations on catalysis and substrate binding, steady state kinetic parameters were measured for complexes containing the WT subunits, hCIT/NgBR, hCIT<sup>K42E/</sup>NgBR, hCIT/NgBR<sup>H100A</sup>, hCIT/NgBR<sup>R290H</sup> and hCIT/NgBR<sup>G292A</sup> (Table 2). The K42E substitution of hCIT reduced k<sub>cat</sub>, and increased the K<sub>m</sub> for FPP but not the affinity for IPP. NgBR<sup>H100A</sup> and NgBR<sup>R290H</sup> decreased the kcat around 4-fold compared to WT enzyme. However, NgBR<sup>H100A</sup> did not exhibit marked changes in affinity for IPP or FPP, whereas NgBR<sup>R290H</sup> had moderately but significantly reduced affinities for IPP. Substitution of G292A in NgBR, which markedly reduced the growth phenotype in yeast, decreased the catalytic activity of the enzyme to an even greater extent with kcat that is 10-fold lower than the WT. In this case, there were modest (5-fold) but significant differences in the K<sub>m</sub> for IPP, and a slight decrease in the K<sub>m</sub> for FPP.</p></sec>

<p>Heteromeric <italic>cis</italic>PTs was predicted in subgroup of <italic>Euryarchaeota</italic>, based on the fact that <italic>Halomebacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaeoglobaceae</italic> have at least two UPPS orthologs: a putative <italic>cis</italic>PT closely related to single subunit <italic>Archea</italic> enzymes, but lacking C-terminal RxG motif, and a NgBR/Nus1like protein (1,33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Here we demonstrate that two subunits of the human <italic>cis</italic>PT, NgBR and hCIT, are required to form a functional enzyme. The purification of the <italic>cis</italic>PT complex supports prior work showing that co-translation of both subunits is required for polyprenol synthesis in vitro and for survival in yeast lacking orthologs of each component(B). Moreover, the catalytic D<sup>34</sup> in hCIT and RxG motif in NgBR, both conserved in homomeric <italic>cis</italic>PT such as UPPS, are critical for catalytic activity of the complex. These data highlight the evolutionary conservation of essential elements required for <italic>cis</italic>PT function throughout all walks of life.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic <italic>cis</italic>PTs were initially presumed to be homomeric based on detailed studies in undecaprenyl diphosphate synthases of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. luteus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Recent work by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and others have shown the essential role of NgBR (and its orthologs including Nus1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and hCIT (and its orthologs including Rer2 and Srt1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) as both being required for <italic>cis</italic>PT activity and polyprenol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The expression of only hCIT or only NgBR does not support growth in the <italic>nus1&#x0394;, rer2&#x0394;, srtl&#x0394;</italic> strain of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and in vitro translation of either subunit is not catalytically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). At first glance, this may appear to be in conflict with previous reports showing that eukaryotic hCIT orthologs heterologously expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were active without co-expression of NgBR/Nus1 orthologs. However, this can be explained due to the presence of the endogenous Nus1 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Furthermore, a number of hCIT orthologs in plants and protists that were studied in yeast are single-subunit enzymes that have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer, and are more closely related to EcUPPS than to hCIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). This complexity can be overcome and simplified by complementation experiments in the <italic>nus1&#x0394;, rer2&#x0394;, srtl&#x0394;</italic> strain as performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) where it is clear that both NgBR and hCIT or a single-subunit enzyme is required.</p>
<p>Previous experiments have shown that co-expression of NgBR with hCIT results in their interaction and stabilization based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Whether NgBR/Nusl serves as an accessory subunit for docking the complex to the ER membrane or is a structural component contributing to catalysis and substrate binding was not known. This idea of NgBR being a docking component was recently reported by Yamashita and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) who identified a three-component system composed of HRBP (a NgBR ortholog), HRT (a hCIT ortholog) and rubber elongation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) all of which were required for long chain prenol or natural rubber synthesis when reconstituted into washed rubber particles. Sequential alignment of nonredundant proteins bearing <italic>cis</italic>PT homology domains presented in this paper enabled the observation of a highly conserved C-terminal RxG motif shared between NgBR/Nus1 and the UPPS group of enzymes. Furthermore, meta-analysis of available experimental data concerning <italic>cis</italic>PT suggests that the C-terminal RxG motif is indispensable for enzymatic activity. The importance of the RxG motif is strengthened by the fact that NgBR<sup>R290H</sup> mutation causes a congenital disorder of glycosylation due to defects in dolichol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). To further elucidate the role of NgBR in h<italic>cis</italic>PT activity, we successfully purified the WT NgBR/hCIT complex and its mutated versions to homogeneity and biochemically characterized the proteins. Mutations in either subunit of h<italic>cis</italic>PT reduces enzymatic activity in comparison to the WT enzyme and these results are in agreement with the predicted function of the analyzed residue in homomeric <italic>cis</italic>PTs.</p>
<p>The first observation supporting a functional role of the extreme C-terminus of NgBR regulating enzyme activity is derived from patients harboring an R290H mutation in NgBR which reduces activity in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and now seen with the purified complex (Table 2) by 70-80&#x0025;. In addition, epitope tagging the C -terminus, of NgBR reduces activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and this has been previously shown in the CPT-like (CPTL) NgBR ortholog of <italic>L. sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Crystallographic data obtained for homomeric EcUPPS, shows that Arg<sup>242</sup> in the RxG motif is involved in Mg<sup>&#x002B;2&#x005F;</sup> IPP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In addition, the role of the C terminus in IPP binding and catalysis is supported by structural information obtained for decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (DPS) of <italic>M</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and zFPPS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In the structure of DPS, the extreme C terminus of one monomer of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase interacts with the active site of the other subunit. Based on our biochemical data and the available structural information for homomeric <italic>cis</italic>PTs, it is likely that Arg<sup>290</sup> in the RxG motif of NgBR is involved in IPP binding and the flexible nature of glycine in the motif, may permit conformational changes to seal the active site cavity. Collectively these data imply that both subunits contribute to enzymatic activity and the C-terminal tail of NgBR regulates aspects of <italic>cis</italic>PT catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The general function of NgBR orthologs as a <italic>cis</italic>PT subunit is further supported by the heteromeric <italic>cis</italic>PT from <italic>M. acetovorans</italic>. MaUPPS-B (NgBR ortholog) is missing any predicted TM domains and yet MaUPPS-A/ MaUPPS-B complex is indispensable for supporting the growth of triple deletion strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Since the mutations in conserved region of MaUPPS-B have similar impact on MaUPPS activity as those in distantly related h<italic>cis</italic>PT, we postulate a common mechanism for both enzymes.</p>
<p>In summary, this study strongly advances the concept that eukaryotic <italic>cis</italic>PT is composed of two subunits, NgBR and hCIT, and this two component system is conserved in <italic>Methanosarcina acetovorans</italic>. Interestingly, conservation of the RxG motif across phyla implicates a catalytic role of NgBR orthologs in the synthesis of polyprenol diphosphates critical for cellular function. Future structural studies on the heteromeric NgBR/hCIT complex will permit a deeper mechanistic understanding of how the C terminus regulates substrate binding and catalysis.</p></sec>

<p>Standard incubation mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 &#x03BC;l, 50 &#x03BC;M FPP,100 &#x03BC;M [1- 14C]&#x002D;IPP (55 mCi/mmol) 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM Mgcl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM 2&#x2013;mercaptoethanol, 1mg/ml BSA, 10mM KF and 1&#x0025; (w/v) phosphatidylinositol. Membrane or crude protein (100 &#x03BC;g) or 20-100 ng of purified protein was used for activity assays. In some experiments with crude membranes, zaragozic acid A (10 &#x03BC;M) was added. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37&#x00B0;C and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chlorof orm-methanol 3:2. The protein pellet was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was washed three times with 115 volume of 10 mM EDTA in 0.9&#x0025; NaCI. The incorporation of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>C-IPP into organic fractions containing polyprenyl diphosphate was measured by scintillation counting. To analyze the length of polyprenol diphosphates lipids were subjected to mild acid hydrolysis (1 hr incubation at 80 &#x00B0;C in 500 &#x03BC;l of N HCL solution). Dephosphorylated lipids were extracted 3 times with 1 volume of hexane. Organic fraction was washed with <bold>1</bold> volume of water. Then organic solvent was evaporated and lipids were loaded together with dolichol19 as internal standard onto HPTLC RP-18 plates with and run in acetone containing 50 mM H<sub>3</sub>P0<sub>4</sub>.

The protein pellet was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was washed three times with 115 volume of 10 mM EDTA in 0.9&#x0025; NaCl. The organic phase was concentrated under a stream of nitrogen. Then organic solvent was evaporated and lipids were loaded onto HPTLC RP-18 precoated plates with a concentrating zone and run in acetone containing 50 mM H<sub>3</sub>P0<sub>4</sub>. Plates were exposed to film to visualize the products of IPP incorporation. To measure incorporation of radioactive IPP into polyprenol fraction, the gel from the zone containing radiolabeled polyprenols was scraped and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. To analyze the length of polyprenol diphosphates before running the TLC analysis lipids were subjected to mild acid hydrolysis. Lipids were loaded onto HPTLC RP-18 together with undecaprenol as internal standard and subjected to radio-autography as was described above.</p></sec>
