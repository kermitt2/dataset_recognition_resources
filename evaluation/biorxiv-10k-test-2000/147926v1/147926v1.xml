<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>A central theme in biology is to understand the molecular basis of fitness: which strategies succeed under which conditions; how are they mechanistically implemented; and which constraints shape trade-offs between alternative strategies. We approached these questions with parallel bacterial evolution experiments in chemostats. Chemostats provide a constant environment with a defined resource limitation (glucose), in which the growth rate can be controlled. Using <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, we found a single mutation in a global regulator of carbon metabolism, CcpA, to confer predictable fitness improvements across multiple growth rates. <italic>In silico</italic> protein structural analysis complemented with biochemical and phenotypic assays, show that the mutation reprograms the CcpA regulon, specifically targeting transporters. This supports that membrane occupancy, rather than biosynthetic capacity, is the dominant constraint for the observed fitness enhancement. It also demonstrates that cells can modulate a pleiotropic regulator to work around limiting constraints.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Many microorganisms have a remarkable versatility to adapt to different environments, either at the short time scale through signaling and gene expression networks, or at an evolutionary time scale through genomic adaptations to selective pressures. A key question in (micro)biology, is how specific selective pressures shape molecular strategies, how evolvable they are, and which constraints and resulting trade-offs in phenotypic traits are relevant under what condition.</p>
<p>In recent years a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dekel and Alon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Molenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2014</xref>) pointed towards cellular resource limitations, born from environmental (nutritional) constraints but also from intrinsic kinetic and physicochemical constraints, as main forces for regulatory strategies. These relate to the role of protein costs in particular, and how the need for ribosomal protein synthesis capacity requires growth-rate dependent regulation of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Although these concepts can explain many regulatory phenomena, such as catabolite repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">G&#x00F6;rke and St&#x00FC;lke, 2008</xref>) and overflow metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Basan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), it remains to be demonstrated (i) to what extent such strategies require optimality or are optimal solutions to the resource allocation problem; (ii) what exactly the constraints are that govern the resource allocation; (iii) what the regulatory mechanisms are that result in proteome re-allocation; and (iv) whether these concepts apply to microorganisms other than <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x2013; the organism for which these concepts have been largely developed and experimentally tested.</p>
<p>We have recently challenged the view that protein costs play a role in metabolic switches in the lactic acid bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>: we found a switch from mixed acid fermentation to homolactic fermentation (an anaerobic variant of the Crabtree effect) in the absence of proteome alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goel, Eckhardt, Puri, Jong, Branco dos Santos, Giera, Fusetti, Vos, Kok, Poolman, Molenaar, Kuipers and Teusink, 2015</xref>). One explanation was that this bacterium might not display optimal behaviour in the chemostat in which they were cultivated. This primed us to do laboratory evolution experiments as they offer unique opportunities for the testing of adaptive strategies, whilst monitoring evolving populations under well-defined conditions.</p>
<p>Laboratory evolution of microorganisms can be carried out under a broad range of selective pressures, such as varying growth rate in serial batch cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wiser, Ribeck and Lenski, 2013</xref>), antibiotic resistance in different cultivation settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">L&#x00E1;z&#x00E1;r <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), growth rate under nutrient limitation in chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gresham and Hong, 2014</xref>), cell number in emulsion-based systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and growth rate in dynamic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meadows <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, to study the role of limited resource allocation on adaptive strategies, at different growth rates and evolutionary time scales, the chemostat is perfect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gresham and Hong, 2014</xref>). It allows for full control over the nature of the resource limitation and the growth rate, and provide a constant, steady-state environment. We studied microbial evolution of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> in highly-standardized glucose-limited chemostats at two different dilution rates with four replicates each. We found the exact same residue of a pleiotropic regulator to be mutated in all of these experiments, and confirm the fitness-enhancing effect of this mutation in chemostat competition experiments at other dilution rates as well. Detailed characterization of the biochemical and phenotypical consequences of the mutation demonstrated a reprogramming of the regulatory logic of the regulator, by inducing the suppression of alternative carbon uptake systems under low glucose levels whilst maintaining the &#x2013;otherwise similarly regulated- high affinity glucose transporter. The occurrence of one dominant mutation suggests a single-peaked fitness landscape and shows that the dominant constraint under such chemostat conditions is not cytosolic protein synthesis costs, but rather membrane occupancy. We thus experimentally confirm and extend previous computational studies in <italic>E coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">O&#x2019;Brien <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) which suggested the action of different constraints (nutrient limitation and proteome limitation) under different conditions. While doing so, we provide a full mechanistic mapping from mutation to regulation to fitness.</p>

<title>Chemostat and cultivation design for long-term microbial evolution under stable environmental conditions</title>
<p>Until now, microbial evolution in chemostats has been rather limited by the number of replicates and by the number of generations, <italic>i.e.</italic> volume changes. Initially described as a device that could continuously cultivate bacteria for an indefinite period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Novick and Szilard, 1950</xref>), to date the longest published cultivation using a chemostat is only a few hundred generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gresham and Hong, 2014</xref>). This is several orders of magnitude shorter than the longest serial batch cultivation experiments &#x2013; 50,000 generations and counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wiser, Ribeck and Lenski, 2013</xref>). To address the failure of long-term continuous cultivation, we developed a versatile bioreactor cap and experimental set-up to perform parallel, prolonged cultivations under chemostat conditions, at small working volumes (detailed in Supplementary Materials and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These advances allowed us to conduct experiments in quadruplicate for more than 1000 consecutive generations.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

<p>Additionally, a requirement of laboratory evolution is that sources of technical variability between replicates are minimized. Our initial focus was set on carefully defining the cultivation conditions (chemostat and medium) and on standardizing experimental procedures (inoculation, sampling, and cell storage). We developed a chemically defined medium particularly suited for prolonged cultivation (CDMPC) based on the nutrient requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jensen and Hammer, 1993</xref>) and biomass composition of <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oliveira, Nielsen and F&#x00F6;rster, 2005</xref>) (detailed in supplementary materials). To reduce inoculum variability we implemented a strictly controlled cryopreservation and inoculation procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and detailed in Supplementary Materials).</p>
<p>The cultivation history of bacterial strains is of upmost importance. Strains can rapidly deviate from their original genotype, which can lead to noticeable phenotypic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Linares, Kok and Poolman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Our initial inoculum came from the original <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 sequenced stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Linares, Kok and Poolman, 2010</xref>). Since our newly designed medium could potentially lead to the selection of new genotypes, we performed a short-term serial batch adaptation of this strain to the medium CDMPC. The resulting single isolate picked (Genr0) was cryopreserved and used as the seeding population for all the laboratory evolution experiments performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Parallel laboratory evolution in chemostat cultures</title>
<p>We exposed <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 to parallel chemostat cultivations: Genr0 was cultivated continuously in quadruplicate, each using 60 mL glucose-limited chemostats at a growth rate of 0.5h<sup>-1</sup> for over 300 volume changes. Culture samples were harvested periodically every 10-15 generations from the effluent to determine cell density and the fluxes of fermentation substrates and products (an example is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cell samples were stored as glycerol stocks at -80&#x00B0;C to be used as snapshots of the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Throughout the prolonged cultivation, all four replicates (referred hereon as 309C1 through 309C4) displayed very similar behavior. Biomass concentration did not vary significantly indicating that biomass yield on substrate remained fairly constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). <italic>L. lactis</italic> can catabolize glucose through homolactic or mixed acid fermentation, excreting, respectively, lactate, or acetate, formate and ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Thomas, Ellwood and Longyear, 1979</xref>). At a dilution rate of 0.5 h<sup>-1</sup>, Genr0 produces mainly lactate (lactate:acetate ratio &#x007E;16). Throughout the course of the experiment, all parallel reactors shifted gradually towards mixed acid fermentation leading to a ratio of approximately 7. Despite the fact that this fermentative mode leads to a theoretical 50&#x0025; increase in ATP yield, the biomass concentration did not change. The latter can be explained by the observation that the evolved cells also gradually excreted more pyruvate, the final shared precursor of the homolactic and the mixed acid fermentative pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>When evolved cells were grown on glucose in batch, we observed differences with Genr0 in the maximal growth rate (&#x03BC;<sub>max)</sub>, length of the lag phase and sedimentation. We compared to Genr0 both the population samples collected after 309 generations and single colony isolates from the evolved population samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">6</xref>). Irrespective of whether the evolved populations or the isolates were compared, they were clearly outperformed by Genr0 in batch. Most notably, &#x03BC;<sub>max</sub> dropped to a value close to the dilution rate at which cells were evolved, which falls nearly 25&#x0025; below the &#x03BC;<sub>max</sub> of the parent strain. The evolved strains also exhibited extended lag phases and sedimentation during batch cultivations. The sedimentation was reminiscent of the AcmA-deficient phenotype previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buist <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Identification of the mutations arising during the evolutionary experiment</title>
<p>We sequenced single-colony isolates from the original strain stock of Genr0 and from the end of the four replicate evolution experiments performed at a dilution rate of 0.5h<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> 309C1, 309C2, 309C3, 309C4). The published whole genome sequence for <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Linares, Kok and Poolman, 2010</xref>) was used as a reference for sequence assembly. Mutations were identified and verified by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 2). In comparison with Genr0, we found SNPs unique to the evolved strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The number of SNPs accumulated per genome was between one (309C1) and six (309C4). This corresponds to a mutation rate of 1.3 to 7.8 x 10<sup>-9</sup> (per base pair per generation) and is in line with currently published estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barrick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>All of the SNPs in the coding regions were non-synonymous (more details in Supplementary Materials), and strikingly, all strains accumulated a mutation in the codon coding for Met19 in the global transcriptional regulator CcpA of Genr0. At the DNA level, the mutations differed between the evolved strains. In strains 309C1, 309C2, and 309C3, ATG was mutated to either ATA or ATC, resulting in the amino acid change from Met to Ile. In none of the sequencing experiments performed for cells cultured at a D of 0.5h<sup>-1</sup> was the Ile codon ATT identified (see also section on <italic>Dynamics of Evolution Experiments</italic>). For strain 309C4 the ATG codon was mutated to ACG resulting in a Met to Thr change. Strains 309C2, 309C3 and 309C4 contain a few additional mutations, while the isolate of 309C1 only contains the SNP in <italic>ccpA</italic>. Since 309C1 exhibits very similar phenotypes to those of the other strains, this mutation must be sufficient to confer a growth advantage to the evolved strains when compared to Genr0, and to a great extent be the genetic basis of the common phenotypic differences observed. These include the growth kinetics and sedimentation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">6</xref>) and, as addressed below, altered glucose utilization kinetics. The sequences were also analyzed for insertions and/or deletions and when compared to the Genr0 sequence; the evolved strains showed no major frameshifts (see Supplementary Table 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Effect of CcpA M19I on global gene expression patterns</title>
<p>The evolved strains were revived in CDMPC and grown until mid-exponential phase at which point microarray analyses were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kuipers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Gene expression in the evolved strains was compared to that of Genr0. Evolved strain 309C1, which contains only the SNP in <italic>ccpA,</italic> showed an altered gene expression dominated by genes involved in membrane transport, especially carbohydrate import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Table 4). CcpA controls the preferential use of glucose over other sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deutscher, Francke and Postma, 2006</xref>) and regulon analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that CcpA-regulated genes were indeed over-represented in the data set.</p>
<p><italic>L. lactis</italic> contains three glucose import systems &#x2013; two phosphotransferase systems, PTS<sup>Man</sup> and PTS<sup>Cel</sup>, and a glucose facilitated diffusion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Castro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) &#x2013; and expression of the genes encoding the high affinity PTS<sup>Man</sup> were up-regulated compared to the original strain, while those encoding the low affinity PTS<sup>Cel</sup> were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The effects of these gene expression changes were investigated further by monitoring the uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-glucose in whole cells. In accordance with the sequencing and gene expression data, <italic>i.e.</italic> the glucose transporters themselves are not mutated but rather their expression is changed: the rate at which glucose was taken up by the cells was increased nearly 3-fold in the evolved strain, while the apparent Michaelis constant for glucose was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 3.</label><caption>
<title>Altered gene expression in strain 309C1 is focused on transport pathways.</title><p>(a) The expression of genes involved in glucose uptake in <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 was significantly changed in the evolved strains. Highlighted in green are genes that were up-regulated and in red those that were down-regulated. (b) Kinetic parameters of glucose transport in Genr0 and strain 309C1 were determined in cells grown to exponential phase in CDMPC. Glucose transport was assayed with [<sup>14</sup>-C]-labeled glucose. Values of three independent experiments were averaged and are reported &#x00B1;SD. V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> were determined using glucose concentrations from 1.2 to 200 &#x03BC;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gouridis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="147926_fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>The ability to utilize other carbon sources was diminished for the evolved strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). This coincided with the down regulation of, amongst others, genes encoding for maltose transporters, ABC sugar importers and sugar utilization enzymes (Supplementary Table 3), many of which are CcpA-regulated.</p>
<p>In general, CcpA is a versatile global regulator that can act as a transcriptional repressor or activator. An amino acid substitution in the DNA binding region may therefore have qualitatively different effects at different target promoters. This is indeed what we observe: 15 CcpA-regulated genes are down regulated, 6 are up-regulated, while 11 remain unchanged. We next examined the molecular basis of the differential effects on expression.</p>

<title>Effect of M19I mutation on the binding affinity of CcpA</title>

<p>For all 4 <italic>cre</italic> sites tested <italic>in vitro</italic>, the CcpA-Ile19 variant showed an increase in binding affinity for the DNA operators selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). This was most pronounced for the sequence upstream of <italic>ptcB</italic> and least pronounced for <italic>mtlD</italic>.

The Ile variant had a more negative free energy of binding as compared to the wild type protein, whereas the Thr variant did not exhibit significantly different binding to the wild type protein.

<title>Population dynamics of prolonged cultivation experiments</title>
<p>The frozen population stocks, collected periodically throughout the prolonged cultivations, served as snapshots of the adaptive evolution process to the chemostat environment. By determining the abundance of the CcpA-Ile19 variant in stocks collected at different generations, we were able to unravel the wash-in dynamics that outcompeted the native CcpA-Met19. Quantification was carried out using pyrosequencing of the region containing the SNP in the <italic>ccpA</italic> locus. The CcpA-Ile19 variant emerged after 50 generations in the evolved populations and became dominant already by generation 150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). While Met is encoded by ATG, Ile can be encoded by ATA, ATC or ATT. However, only the first two codons were identified in the D=0.5 h<sup>-1</sup> evolution experiment, with the ATA mutant emerging prior to ATC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS12">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). At generation 309, when the experiment was stopped, over 97&#x0025; of the population carried the CcpA-Ile19 variant.</p>
<p>We then tested whether the phenotypic changes imposed by the CcpA mutation would be sufficient to explain the wash-in kinetics observed using the glycerol stocks. For this purpose, a simple model of chemostat growth with two competing strains was used to simulate the prolonged experiment at a D of 0.5h<sup>-1</sup>. The model was able to accurately fit the observed population dynamics, suggesting that the underlying mechanism can be fully understood in terms of chemostat wash-in kinetics and is attributable to the mutant CcpA regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Figures 13A-C</xref>). Sensitivity analysis of this model showed that two pairs of parameters cannot be estimated independently, only their ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Supplementary Figures 13D-E</xref>). These are (i) the Monod constants (K<sub>s</sub>) of the parent (Genr0) and the evolved (309C1-C4) strains and (ii) the biomass yield of the parent strain and the emergence frequency of the fitter strain. This uncertainty has, however, no implications for the conclusions derived from the model. Another important aspect emerged from analyzing the model: the cells evolved at a D=0.5h<sup>-1</sup> are predicted to outcompete Genr0 at any constant dilution rate not higher than &#x03BC;<sub>max</sub>.</p>

<title>Parallel laboratory evolution and competition experiments under chemostat conditions at different dilution rates</title>
<p>We next addressed whether the fitness effect of the CcpA-Ile19 variant is dependent on growth rate. We performed new evolution experiments in the chemostat environment at a dilution rate of 0.6h<sup>-1</sup>, since at a D closer to &#x03BC;<sub>max</sub> (&#x007E;0.67 h<sup>-1</sup>), the concentration of limiting nutrient becomes higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goel, Eckhardt, Puri, Jong, Branco dos Santos, Giera, Fusetti, Vos, Kok, Poolman, Molenaar, Kuipers and Teusink, 2015</xref>), hence modulating the strength of the selection pressure applied. Experiments were carried out for as many as 800 volume changes, in a similar fashion as was done for the D of 0.5h<sup>-1</sup>. Sanger sequencing of the <italic>ccpA</italic> locus from fragments, obtained by PCR using the frozen stocks as templates, indicated that indeed the CcpA-Ile19 substitution was washing in as predicted by the model. Re-sequencing of the whole-genome of single isolates of each of the populations evolved at 0.6h<sup>-1</sup> revealed that once again the only mutation that was consistent across all isolates was located in residue 19 of CcpA. This time all possible codons that encode Ile were found, suggesting that the amino acid substitution is the only factor that confers a strong fitness benefit.</p>
<p>We further tested whether the same mutation is also advantageous for dilution rates that are far lower than &#x03BC;<sub>max</sub> by performing competition experiments in chemostats between Genr0 and 309C1 (harboring only the CcpA-Met19 mutation). We used our growth model parameterized with the data from the evolution experiments at a D of 0.5h<sup>-1</sup>, to simulate the population dynamics of competition experiments carried out at a D of 0.2 and 0.3h<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Based on this, we designed and performed the experiments, in which a small fraction (&#x007E;10&#x0025;) of cells from a steady-state culture of 309C1 were mixed with a steady-state culture of Genr0 maintained at the same D. The population dynamics of these mixed cultures were monitored in time by collecting samples from the culture effluent, and determining relative fractions using pyrosequencing as before. We found an excellent agreement between experimental data and model simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that the fitness benefit of the CcpA-Met19 mutation is growth-rate independent.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Replicate chemostats show high evolvability and low plasticity</title>
<p>We studied the molecular mechanism of the adaptive strategy employed by <italic>L. lactis</italic> during growth in a glucose-limited chemostat. In this way, we kept the identity of the selective pressure constant, but varied its strength by imposing different dilution rates. Miniature chemostats were constructed and growth medium and protocols developed that allowed highly standardized, parallel and stable conditions for evolutionary studies in quadruplicate for hundreds of consecutive generations, providing true biological replicates of this early evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, we found rapid fixation of exactly the same beneficial amino-acid substitution across all parallel evolutionary experiments, independent of growth rate. This demonstrates a high evolvability with low evolutionary plasticity under these conditions. Evolutionary plasticity is related to the existence of alternative mutations that give rise to a comparable fitness enhancement for a particular selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Snell-Rood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Forsman, 2014</xref>). Plasticity is high when many alternatives exist. Evolvability considers the rate of evolution. It is both related to the number of mutations required, and their fixation rate, to reach a specific quantitative change in fitness. If several mutations are required in sequence for a specific quantitative change in fitness then evolvability is low, and vice-versa. Evolvability can be assessed by determining the number of generations that it takes fitter mutants to fix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Colegrave and Collins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pigliucci, 2008</xref>). High plasticity and high evolvability occur when alternative mutants fix at similar rates. High evolvability can also occur at low plasticity: then one mutation fixes across replicates and dilution rates. The latter was clearly the case in our study, and it appears that there is a single-peaked fitness landscape, suggesting a strong preference for this specific mechanism, independent of the strength of the selection pressure. As we will discuss shortly, our data suggest that alleviating constraints on membrane occupancy may be that mechanism.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Mutation in a global regulator rather than specifically in a glucose transporter</title>
<p>In the chemostat, fitter mutants outgrow their competitors because they can grow at a rate equal to the dilution rate, but at a lower concentration of the limiting nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gresham and Hong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wortel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). So, in glucose-limited chemostats, one expects enhanced selective pressure toward increased efficiency of glucose uptake, which could be achieved by mutating or elevating the expression of high-affinity transport systems, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Solopova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, although glucose transport activity did increase, we found a mutation with pleiotropic effects in the global carbon metabolism regulator CcpA, rather than in any of the three glucose transporters.</p>
<p>The DNA binding domain of CcpA is highly conserved and in natural isolates of <italic>L. lactis,</italic> as well as in CcpA homologues of other Gram-positive organisms such as <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> the Met residue is present at an equivalent position. Based on the high-resolution structures of CcpA from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, this residue directly interacts with the nucleobases in the <italic>ackA2</italic> and <italic>glntR</italic> promoter sequences but not with the synthetic <italic>cre</italic> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schumacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Whether CcpA binds with a higher or lower affinity to certain <italic>cre</italic> sites has been investigated in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marciniak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). While the focus was on the <italic>cre</italic> site sequence itself, our study gives insights into the effect of the CcpA amino acid sequence on DNA binding. The direct-binding data show that the effect of the amino acid substitution consistently results in a tighter binding of CcpA to <italic>cre</italic> sequences, although not always to the same extent. Other factors such as distance of the <italic>cre</italic> site to the transcriptional start site, and/or the presence of other transcriptional regulators governing the expression of the operon are known to affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deutscher, Francke and Postma, 2006</xref>). The different extent of tighter binding of the evolved CcpA, in conjugation with the different regulatory effects that CcpA may adopt for different operons, results in the reprogramming of the this regulon, particularly around membrane proteins (underlying reasons are addressed below). This allows the overall fine-tuning rather than the optimization of a particular trait (e.g. increasing Ks of a single transporter), in response to imposed selection pressure.</p>
<p>CcpA was not the only global regulator to accumulate mutations. We also found a Phe substitution for Ile<sup>214</sup> in the DNA binding domain of CodY, a global regulator of nitrogen metabolism in <italic>L. lactis</italic>. This mutation was only found in one chemostat but, similar to the mutation accumulated in <italic>ccpA,</italic> indicates a strategy of modulation of global gene expression in response to the culture conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Fitness enhancement independent from growth rate requires phenotypic plasticity</title>
<p>The fact that we find a single mutation and that we can capture the population dynamics of the CcpA-Met19 allele wash-in at different dilution rates with a simple growth model with fixed kinetics, shows that the mechanism underlying the adaptation to a constant glucose-limiting environment is independent of the growth rate. Yet different growth rates do require different fluxes of glucose uptake, catabolism and biosynthesis. In view of the prevailing perspective of growth-rate dependent regulation of the proteome, including global regulatory mechanisms that may depend on this flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kotte, Zaugg and Heinemann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Basan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), this is far from trivial. This seems only possible if the cells possess a form of non-genetic phenotypic plasticity that tolerates the adjustment of the gene-regulatory circuitry under different conditions. A recent functional genomics study of the parent Genr0 strain at different growth rates &#x2013; using the same standard cultivation conditions &#x2013; indeed suggests that regulation at the metabolic level is the dominant form of phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goel, Eckhardt, Puri, Jong, Branco dos Santos, Giera, Fusetti, Vos, Kok, Poolman, Molenaar, Kuipers and Teusink, 2015</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> the proteome of <italic>L. lactis</italic> hardly changed in the wide range of growth rates also studies here (0.2 &#x2013; 0.6 h<sup>-1</sup>). The presence of such metabolic phenotypic plasticity seems therefore a requirement for our finding of low genetic plasticity and high evolvability. It shows that the intracellular proteome does not impose major constraints on the organism under these conditions, but rather the proteome of the membrane, as we will discuss next.</p>

<title>Reprogramming of gene expression hints at an important constraint at the level of membrane occupancy</title>
<p>While the mutation in CcpA does increase the expression of genes for high affinity glucose PTS systems (e.g. PTS<sup>Man</sup>), it simultaneously downregulates the expression of unused membrane proteins such as transporters for other sugars and respiratory proteins. This dual role was shown experimentally to indeed result in evolved cells with a more efficient glucose uptake, and suggests that the most successful adaptation to constant glucose-limitation in <italic>L. lactis</italic> requires reprogramming of membrane occupancy, not only upregulation of the specific transporter. The idea that constraints related to limited resources and physicochemical properties affect evolutionary strategies and create trade-offs is much under debate in recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Molenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goel, Eckhardt, Puri, Jong, Branco dos Santos, Giera, Fusetti, Vos, Kok, Poolman, Molenaar, Kuipers, Teusink, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">O&#x2019;Brien, Utrilla and Palsson, 2016</xref>). One interpretation of our data is that the down-regulation of membrane processes provides more membrane space for glucose transporters, in analogy with re-allocation of cytosolic proteins, as happens in <italic>E coli</italic> under different growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with a detailed computational study of <italic>E. coli</italic> that suggested the presence of different growth regimes with different constraints limiting growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">O&#x2019;Brien <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). At low growth rates, nutrient uptake was assumed to be the dominant constraint, and cytosolic protein machinery for growth is in excess; only at nutrient excess, internal proteome constraints became dominant. Such excess of cytosolic proteins at sub-maximal growth can explain the predominantly metabolic regulation of flux under our conditions, and hence explains the required phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goel, Eckhardt, Puri, Jong, Branco dos Santos, Giera, Fusetti, Vos, Kok, Poolman, Molenaar, Kuipers and Teusink, 2015</xref>). We thus provide an experimental case-study that suggests that indeed uptake constraints are the main constraint for fitness in the chemostat, and that global regulators may be able to overcome them, through pleiotropic effects.</p>
<p>In line with this, we found that the growth rate of the CcpA-Met19 mutant was lower than in wildtype when grown in batch (glucose excess), despite higher glucose uptake capacity - something that is rather common for microorganisms evolved to nutrient-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gresham and Hong, 2014</xref>). Also serial batch growth of <italic>L. lactis</italic> in emulsion&#x2013; a method to select for high cell number &#x2013; selected for a mutation in the glucose transporter itself, rather than in a regulator thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In that case, the mutation reduced glucose transport activity, thereby mimicking a low-glucose environment associated with acetogenic metabolism, a high ATP-yield strategy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work shows that evolution to constant growth conditions can be mediated by global regulators such as the carbon catabolite protein CcpA. Metabolic engineering through the mutation of global regulators was first demonstrated by Stephanopoulos and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Moxley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We here show that the subtle manipulation of global regulators to change entire metabolic networks is a strategy already employed by nature.</p>

<title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays</title>
<p>To determine the <italic>cre</italic> site DNA binding affinity of CcpA, binding assays were performed with Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides. DNA oligonucleotides were from Biolegio B.V. (Nijmegen, the Netherlands) with the (&#x002B;) strand labelled at the 5&#x2019;end with Cy3 and the (-) strand unlabeled. The oligonucleotides were mixed 1:1, incubated at 98&#x00B0;C for 3 minutes and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature to facilitate annealing. The annealed DNA was used at 4 nM and added to binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5&#x0025; glycerol) with additional BSA to 40 &#x03BC;g/ml. CcpA was added to concentrations between 100 nM and 800 nM. The binding reaction was performed at 30 &#x00B0;C for 20 minutes after which the samples were mixed with 5 X gel loading buffer (0.25&#x0025; bromophenol blue, 40&#x0025; sucrose). The samples were analysed by electrophoresis on 7.5&#x0025; native polyacrylamide gels using a TBE buffer (90 mM Tris, 90 mM Boric Acid, 2 mM EDTA pH8.0). The fluorescent-labelled oligonucleotides were visualised on a LAS-4000 imager (Fujifilm).</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>The simulated structures were based on the crystal structures of CcpA bound to different DNA sequences by Schumacher <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schumacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Homology models of <italic>L. lactis</italic> proteins were created using the Swiss Model Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The sequence identity of the DNA binding domain in proteins from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic> is 77 &#x0025; and only this region of the protein was used for the simulation. Structures with differing DNA sequences were produced by fitting the differing bases to a crystal structure before equilibrating the system. The protein domains after residue 64 were removed from the simulation system and a harmonic bond with a 1000 kJ/(mol nm<sup>2</sup>) force constant was set between the backbone atoms of the last residues to restrain the structure of the remaining domains. Each system was solvated in a dodecahedron box where each face of the box was at least 1 nm from the protein and the DNA. This amounted in average to about 14500 water molecules, 130 Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions and 110 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, which corresponds to a 420 mM NaCl solution and counter-ions.</p>
<p>All simulations were run using the Gromacs 4.5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hess <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) simulation package. The protein and DNA were modelled with CHARMM27 force field with CMAP corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Foloppe and MacKerell Jr., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">MacKerell, Feig and Brooks, 2004</xref>) together with the original TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jorgensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>) as implemented in Gromacs 4.5.5.</p>
<p>Free energy changes were calculated from simulations using the Bennett acceptance ratio method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bennett, 1976</xref>) with the g_bar tool in Gromacs. Gromacs is a free software package available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gromacs.org/">http://www.gromacs.org/</ext-link>. Relative free energies of binding were calculated using a thermodynamic cycle described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<title>Mutations in all sequenced strains compared to published sequences</title>
<p>The sequences of Genr0 and the evolved strains were compared to those published for <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363. All strains contained a mutation in <italic>malR</italic> which would results in a frameshift in the maltose operon transcriptional repressor MalR. This could be due to sequencing errors from adjacent C nucleotides or a truncated MalR protein. The truncation would result in a HTH DNA binding domain without a ligand-binding domain.</p>

<title>Mutations unique to strains 309C2, 309C3 and 309C4</title>
<p>The effect of the mutations identified in <italic>rpoC</italic> in 309C2 and <italic>greA</italic> in 309C4 on transcriptional fidelity were investigated using <italic>lacZ</italic> constructs with a premature stop codon at position Glu<sup>13</sup> (P. Gamba and J.W. Veening, unpublished data). However, &#x03B2;-galactosidase activity was similar in the evolved strains and the original strains Genr0 and <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), indicating that in the evolved strains, RNA polymerase and elongation factor function as they do in wild type strains.</p>
<p>Since proteins encoded by llmg_1597, a hypothetical protein possibly with RNA-binding function, and <italic>llrF,</italic> a two-component system regulator, are not well-characterized, no prediction as to change or function could be made for the mutations identified. In contrast, CodY is a well-studied transcriptional regulator of nitrogen metabolism and based on structural studies it can be predicted that the SNP identified results in a Phe substitution for Ile<sup>214</sup> in the DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Levdikov, Blagova, Joseph, Sonenshein, &#x0026; Wilkinson, 2006</xref>). The absence of a high-resolution structure of CodY bound to a DNA operator makes any further prediction of the effect on DNA binding difficult.</p>
<p>A number of SNPs were predicted to lie in non-coding regions at positions that lie in or near putative promoter sequences, thus making predictions as to the effect of such mutations difficult. The SNP at position 490263 resulted in an altered ribosomal binding site (GGAGGA to GGAGAA) upstream of the gene for a Hu-like DNA binding protein, <italic>hllA</italic>. This could suggest that a modest reduction of the translation of this mRNA, encoding a putative DNA-binding protein, could take place.</p>

<title>Global gene expression patterns of evolved strains</title>
<p>The evolved strains were revived in CDMPC and grown until mid-exponential phase at which microarray analysis using in-house <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 slides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Kuipers et al. 2002</xref>) was performed. Gene expression in the evolved strains was compared to that of Gen0. A total number of 377 genes exhibited changed expression in the evolved strains (Supplementary Table 4). Approximately a third of the changes were in at least 3 of the 4 strains. Altered gene expression was dominantly in genes involved in membrane transport, especially carbohydrate import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Table 4). Regulon analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that CcpA-regulated genes were over-represented in the data set. For strain 309C4, those regulated by CodY were prevalent as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>CcpA controls the preferential use of glucose over other sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Deutscher et al. 2006</xref>), including expression of sugar uptake systems such as those for glucose. Transcriptome analysis of all the evolve strains revealed similar patterns of expression and increased glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref> and D).</p>
<p>The ability to utilize other carbon sources was diminished for the evolved strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>) in accordance with the down regulation of, amongst others, genes encoding for maltose transporters, ABC sugar import systems and sugar utilization enzymes in the microarray data (Supplementary Table 3). Many of these genes are CcpA-regulated.</p>

<title>Phenotypic characterization of evolved strains to identify effects of transcriptional regulation</title>
<p>The strains were not only adapted to the constant culture conditions through expression changes in carbohydrate uptake and utilization systems, but also through changes in the expression levels of genes involved in amino acid uptake and metabolism. Ordinarily, <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 grows faster when amino acids are taken up as oligopeptides than when only free amino acids are available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). This is due to the efficient import of oligopeptides by the major oligopeptide transporter Opp (Detmers et al., 2000). Cultivation in free amino acids led to the down regulation of the entire <italic>opp</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>) and the cells were as a result impaired in growth on oligopeptide containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref> and C). The difference in growth in oligopeptide-containing medium between the evolved strains and Genr0 is well correlated with the expression levels of the <italic>opp</italic> operon except in the case of 309C4. In this strain the down regulation of the <italic>opp</italic> operon appears to be partially compensated for by the concomitant up regulation of the analogous <italic>opp2</italic> operon. This operon was previously thought to be cryptic in <italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sanz et al. 2004</xref>), but in our evolved strain is expressed and OppA2 was detected using mass spectrometry (data not shown).</p>
<p>Prolonged cultivation under an anaerobic atmosphere had a dramatic effect on the ability of the evolved strains to utilize the electron transport chain present in <italic>L. lactis</italic>. <italic>L. lactis</italic> is unable to synthesize heme <italic>de novo,</italic> but if heme is added to the growth medium, the bacterium can synthesize the cytochromes needed for the generation of a proton motive force (PMF) and subsequent ATP synthesis at the membrane-embedded ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Brooijmans et al. 2007</xref>). This results in an increase in biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Cesselin et al. 2001</xref>) as observed for Genr0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The evolved strains did not show any increase in biomass upon addition of heme to the medium and expression data showed the down regulation of a number of NADH oxidases/dehydrogenases (Supplementary Table 3) which are likely to be responsible for the inability of these strains to respire.</p>
<p>In addition the evolved strains displayed a well-characterized long-chain phenotype associated with a deficiency in the major autolysin AcmA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Buist et al. 1995</xref>). The expression of the <italic>acmA</italic> gene was down regulated in all the evolved strains (Supplementary Table 3) and in agreement with the down regulation of the <italic>acmA</italic> gene, the evolved cells were less prone to lysis in the stationary growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of M19I mutation on the binding affinity of CcpA</title>
<p>The effects of the <italic>ccpA</italic> mutations were investigated using homology modeling, molecular dynamic simulations and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays using purified CcpA from the mutated strains. The high-resolution structure of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> CcpA was used to model <italic>L. lactis</italic> CcpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Schumacher et al. 2011</xref>) since the one published for <italic>L. lactis</italic> CcpA lacks the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Loll et al. 2007</xref>). The structure from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> includes CcpA bound to the DNA catabolic response element (<italic>cre</italic> site) as well as the activating phosphoprotein HPr. Met19 is located in the second helix contained in the DNA binding domain. The methionine at this position is highly conserved across all Gram-positive CcpA proteins sequenced to date and in 4 natural isolates of <italic>L. lactis</italic> for which the <italic>ccpA</italic> locus was resequenced (Supplementary Table 6).</p>
<p>The binding of CcpA from Genr0 and 309F1 to 4 DNA operators was examined: synthetic <italic>cre</italic> sites, <italic>cre</italic> site upstream of <italic>ptcB</italic>, <italic>cre</italic> site upstream of <italic>mtlD</italic> and, as a negative control, the CodY binding sequence upstream of <italic>oppD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and Supplementary 10), representing genes that are down regulated as well as up regulated in the evolved strains. For all the cre sites tested, the CcpA-Ile19 variant showed an increase in binding affinity for the DNA operators tested. This was most pronounced for the sequence upstream of <italic>ptcB</italic> and least pronounced for <italic>mtlD</italic>.</p>

<title>Evolution of Ccp-Thr<sup>19</sup> variant</title>
<p>The appearance of and subsequent dominance of the <italic>ccpA</italic> mutations was tracked in time during the evolution experiment through PCR amplification of the <italic>ccpA</italic> locus from the frozen stocks. The PCR products were resequenced using traditional Sanger sequencing, with manual chromatogram inspection, as well as pyrosequencing, which allows for the quantitation of SNPs in a population. In addition, frozen stocks were streaked onto CDMPC agar plates and the <italic>ccpA</italic> locus was PCR amplified and resequenced from single colonies. The CcpA-Ile<sup>19</sup> variant emerged around 50 generations in the evolved strains and by generation 150 was the dominant population in the chemostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Supplementary Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS12">12</xref>). The pattern of emergence was different for strain 309C4, with the emergence of a second variant, i.e. CcpA-Thr<sup>19</sup>. This variant was only detected after 250 generations and by 309 generations both CcpA variants existed in the population. Sequencing of numerous single colony isolates could not detect any wild type <italic>ccpA</italic> by 300 generations (data not shown).</p>
<p>Sequencing of single colony isolates from the C4 frozen stocks, revealed that the unique CcpA-Thr<sup>19</sup> variant is linked to the CodY-Phe<sup>214</sup>. At 309 generations the only combinations identified were CcpA-Ile<sup>19</sup> and CodY-Ile<sup>214</sup> (i.e. wild type CodY) and CcpA-Thr<sup>19</sup> and CodY-Phe<sup>214</sup>. Stocks resequenced from earlier in the evolution experiment also contained CcpA-Thr<sup>19</sup>, CodY-Ile<sup>214</sup> pairs, indicating that the <italic>codY</italic> mutations occurred in the unique CcpA-Thr<sup>19</sup> background.</p>

<title>Chemically defined medium for prolonged cultivations</title>
<p><italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> subsp. <italic>cremoris</italic> MG1363 was grown in a chemically defined medium developed for prolonged cultivation, CDMPC (Supplementary Table 1). The media consists of a phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, supplemented with all 20 amino acids, the vitamins biotin, DL-6,8-thioctic acid, D-pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, pyridoxal hydrochloride, pyridoxine hydrochloride and thiamine hydrochloride, and trace metals (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CoSO<sub>4</sub>, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.

<title>Standardized cryopreservation and inoculation procedure</title>
<p>The outcome of laboratory evolution experiments can be greatly affected by the composition of the population used to seed each of the prolonged cultivations. In order to minimize background genetic variation and variations in pre-culture condition, we developed a standardized cryopreservation and inoculation procedure inspired by industrial procedures to create, maintain and distribute single strain isolate stocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, main text).

An isolated colony was transferred to CDMPC and incubated for 24 hours at 30&#x00B0; C. A 1&#x0025; inoculum of the freshly grown culture was used to inoculate CDMPC. After 5 consecutive transfers under the same conditions and using 1&#x0025; inoculum to seed subsequent cultures, the resulting culture was streaked out in CDMPCA and incubated for 24 hours at 30&#x00B0; C. An isolated colony was transferred to 7.5 ml of CDMPC and incubated for 24 hours at 30&#x00B0; C reaching a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.165. &#x201C;Parent-stocks&#x201D; were then prepared by adding 3.75 ml of sterile 60&#x0025; glycerol and dividing the mixture in 11 aliquots of 1 ml in self-standing Nunc&#x2122; Cryotubes (366656), kept at -80&#x00B0; C for at least for 48 hours before reviving or moving.</p>

<p>One of the 11 aliquots of the parent-stock was used to inoculate 199 ml of CDMPC (0.5&#x0025; inoculum) and incubated for 20 hours at 30&#x00B0; C, until the culture was full-grown. 100 ml of sterile 60&#x0025; glycerol was then added, resulting in 300 ml of 20&#x0025; glycerol stock of <italic>L. lactis</italic> G0 in CDMPC. &#x201C;Working-stocks&#x201D; were then prepared by dividing the latter in 960 aliquots of 0.3 ml in 1.2 ml sterile polypropylene cluster tubes 96-well racked from Corning Incorporated Costar<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (4413). These were capped using 8-Cap Strips from Corning Incorporated Costar<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (4418) and separated into individual vials using a slightly heated bistoury and ruler.

<title>Experimental set up</title>
<p><italic>L. lactis</italic> MG1363 was cultivated in 4 chemostats run in parallel at 30&#x00B0;C at the following dilution rates: 0.5 h<sup>-1</sup> for a total of 309 consecutive generations; 0.6 h<sup>-1</sup> for a total of 700 consecutive generations. Our design makes use of bioreactor lids that can fit any vessel with a GL45 thread. It allows for two connectors to be inserted at variable depths, used here to control the working volume and sampling. These custom made bioreactors were set-up to make four parallel chemostat cultivations controlling stirring, temperature, pH, flow, volume and gas composition. The newly developed caps are versatile and can be readily adapted to other types of controlled cultivation, such as fed-batch, pH-auxostats, turbidostats, retentostats, amongst others. Culture samples can be withdrawn directly through a port present in the centre of the cultivation vessel or by rerouting the effluent using acetal quick-disconnect couplings (Masterflex via Cole Parmer, Schiedam, Netherlands) Throughout the prolonged cultivations samples were collected from the effluent to leave the cultivation undisturbed.</p>
<p>For each set of parallel chemostats, temperature was controlled using a water bath (Thermo Haake DC30-W13/B via Cole Parmer, Schiedam, Netherlands) set to 30&#x00B0;C. Even stirring was ensured using an immersible stirrer unit connected to a remote controller (Cole Parmer, Schiedam, Netherlands) set to &#x007E;300 rpm. Mixing was tested by pulsing with glucose to a final concentration of 60 mM and taking samples at three different positions of the bioreactor. Minor differences were observed between samples harvested at different time points (&#x003C;5&#x0025;), and at small-time scales (&#x003C;10 seconds) the solution appeared equilibrated. pH was measured separately in each culture using a 120 mm gel-filled pH-sensor (Applikon, Schiedam, Netherlands) connected to an Alpha-pH800 (Eutech, Thermoscientific) that controlled a 1 rpm L/S pump drive equipped with an Easy-Load II pump head (Masterflex via Cole Parmer, Schiedam, Netherlands) that titrated the culture with a solution of 2.5 M NaOH. The culture was continuosly flushed through the headspace with a mixture of 5&#x0025; CO2 and 95&#x0025; N2 at a flow rate of 10 culture volumes per hour (i.e. 600 ml/h). The dilution rates of the different prolonged cultivations carried out in this study were set by controlling the flow of CDMPC using a variable speed L/S pump drive equipped with four Easy-Load II pump heads (Masterflex via Cole Parmer, Schiedam, Netherlands). All parallel cultivations were supplied with CDMPC from the same medium vessel.</p>
<p>A small sample was removed every 10-15 generations and stored at -80 &#x00B0;C in 20&#x0025; (v/v) glycerol. In addition, the effluent was collected for optical density at 600 nm (OD600) measurements and HPLC analysis. For subsequent studies, the glycerol stocks were used. 5 ml of fresh CDMPC was inoculated from the frozen glycerol stocks and grown for 16 h at 30&#x00B0;C. The overnight culture was subsequently diluted to a starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.025-0.050 in either CDMPC or M17 medium (Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) supplemented with 0.5&#x0025; (w/v) glucose or other carbon sources as indicated.</p>

<title>Pyrosequencing</title>
<p>Frozen glycerol stocks served as template material for PCR reactions. The PyroMark platform from QIAGEN was used for pyrosequencing and reactions were performed as per manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The region surrounding the point mutations was amplified and biotinylated with the use of a biotinylated reverse primer. To detect the ratio of SNPs in the population, single stranded primers were designed so as to terminate before the codon containing the mutation.</p>

CcpA was purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Kowalczyk and Bardowski 2003</xref>).

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
<p>The free energy of mutating the protein was calculated while protein was bound to DNA and free in solvent and the relative binding free energy of the mutated protein compared to the wild type was obtained by subtracting the free energy of the former from the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>The free energy of mutating the protein was calculated using a topology with two side chains at residue 19. The two side chains did not interact with each other and the mutation was done in three steps. In the first step, the charges of the wild type methionine side chain were uncoupled from rest of the system while the mutated side chain was completely non-interacting. In the second step, the Lennard-Jones interactions of methionine side chain were uncoupled while at the same time the Lennard-Jones interactions of the mutated side chain were coupled to the side chain. In the third step, the charges of the mutated side chain were coupled to the system while the methionine side chain was completely non-interacting. The first and third steps were performed using 5 simulations with different lambda values while the second step used 11 lambda values. Soft-core interactions were used in the second step with soft-core parameter <bold>&#x03B1;</bold> set to 0.5. An error estimate is calculated from block averaging each 1 ns of the simulations and using the standard deviation of the obtained values as the error.</p>
<p>In the simulations, the protein monomers can move relatively freely in solution when DNA is not present and sampling of conformations becomes an issue. To ensure that the conformations sampled would be similar for all CcpA variants, rotational and translational constraints were used to prevent the monomers from moving with reference to each other as described in (50).</p>
<p>A 2 fs time step was used with all bonds constrained using the LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Hess et al. 1997</xref>). Simulations were run with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. Non-bonded interactions were treated as recommended in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Bjelkmar et al. 2010</xref>). Electrostatics were calculated using PME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Essmann et al. 1995</xref>) with a 1.2 nm cut-off. Lennard-Jones interactions were switched off between 1.0 and 1.2 nm and dispersion correction was applied to both energy and pressure. The protein-DNA system and the solvent were separately coupled to a 298 K heat bath using the velocity rescaling thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Bussi et al. 2007</xref>) with &#x03C4;<sub>T</sub> = 0.5 ps. A 1 bar pressure was kept using an isotropic Parrinello-Rahman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Parrinello and Rahman 1981</xref>) pressure coupling with &#x03C4;<sub>p</sub> = 4.0 ps and 4.5e-5 bar<sup>-1</sup> compressibility. Each system was energy minimized and briefly equilibrated with position restraints before being equilibrated for 10 ns. After equilibration each simulation was run for 20 ns except the systems with deviant <italic>cre</italic> sites that were simulated for 10 ns.</p>
<p>All simulations were run using the Gromacs 4.5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Hess et al. 2008</xref>) simulation package. The protein and DNA were modelled with CHARMM27 force field with CMAP corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Foloppe and MacKerell Jr. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">MacKerell et al. 2004</xref>) together with the original TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Jorgensen et al. 1983</xref>) as implemented in Gromacs 4.5.5.</p>
<p>Free energy changes were calculated from simulations using the Bennett acceptance ratio method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Bennett 1976</xref>) with the g_bar tool in Gromacs.
