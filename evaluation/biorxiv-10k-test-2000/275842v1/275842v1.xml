<abstract>
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) synthetic hydrogels have recently emerged as desirable <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture platforms capable of representing the extracellular geometry, elasticity, and water content of tissue in a tunable fashion. However, they are critically limited in their biological functionality. Hydrogels are typically decorated with a scant 1-3 peptide moieties to direct cell behavior, which vastly underrepresents the proteins found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of real tissues. Further, peptides chosen are ubiquitous in ECM, and are not derived from specific proteins. We developed an approach to incorporate the protein complexity of specific tissues into the design of biomaterials, and created a hydrogel with the elasticity of marrow, and 20 marrow-specific cell-instructive peptides. Compared to generic PEG hydrogels, our marrow-inspired hydrogel improves stem cell differentiation and proliferation. We propose this tissue-centric approach as the next generation of 3D hydrogel design for applications in tissue engineering.</p>

<p>The vast majority of materials available to study how environmental cues direct cell fate are two-dimensional (2D), ranging from protein-coated surfaces to hydrogels<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, 2D materials restrict cell adhesions to an x-y plane and force an apical-basal polarity<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. To overcome this, researchers can better recapitulate the <italic>in vivo</italic> geometry of tissues using hydrogels to culture cells in three-dimensions (3D)<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Synthetic hydrogels made with polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be functionalized with peptide motifs that either elicit integrin-binding or allow for cell-mediated matrix degradation. Additionally, PEG hydrogels are extremely reproducible and are independently tunable in both stiffness and ligand density. Nevertheless, in some instances PEG-based hydrogels are generally considered inferior to more complex protein-based hydrogels, like Matrigel, which may more accurately mimic native tissue. A main limitation in the use of naturally derived protein hydrogels is that the constituents are undefined and have extreme batch-to-batch variability. Thus, there is a need for synthetically engineered hydrogels designed to mimic structural and physiochemical features of specific <italic>in vivo</italic> environments.</p>
<p>Bone marrow is the soft interior tissue between hard compact bone where many of our immune and stromal stem cells reside. Like every human tissues and organ, bone marrow has unique biophysical features that are critical for cell and organ function. For example, protein composition and tissue stiffness are important for cellular processes like migration and proliferation<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, as well as regulating stem cell fate and organoid development<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Thus, it is not surprising that the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in the proper function of bone marrow because both hematopoietic and stromal progenitor cells originate from this tissue<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. For example, both bone marrow stiffness and fibronectin are important for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell progenitors<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, marrow-derived stromal stem cells will differentiate into either bone or fat cells in response to mechanical cues<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the presence or absence of vitronectin in 3D scaffolds can facilitate reversible differentiation into or from osteoblasts<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite clear evidence of the marrow ECM regulating the stem cell niche, <italic>in vitro</italic> stem cell culture platforms contain a mere fraction of the biochemical cues typical of the native tissue. Simple RGD-decorated polymers do not fully capture these cues, making it imperative to move toward environments that include the diversity of integrin-binding and protease-sensitive proteins in native tissues and organs. We propose a 3D ECM-focused material based on PEG and peptides. Unique to our approach is the development of a combination of bioinformatics and biomechanics to create a set of tissue-specific design criteria. This new class of tissue-centric PEG hydrogels captures the protein complexity of the native tissue in a material that is extremely tunable and can be fabricated with little technical expertise.</p>

<title>A biomechanics and bioinformatics approach to create a synthetic human bone marrow</title>
<p>A top-down engineering approach was used to identify the physical and chemical properties of bone marrow that could be represented by a synthetic PEG hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a-b</xref>). Bone marrow elasticity was measured via shear rheology, indentation, and cavitation rheology<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We then approximated this elasticity synthetically by adjusting the polymer-polymer distance of the hydrogel, a material that is inherently hydrophilic and mimics marrow&#x2019;s high water content. We have previously demonstrated that bone marrow is a benign elastic material<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Because the viscoelastic properties contribute to stem cell fate<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, we compared the compressive properties of both porcine marrow and of a PEG hydrogel. Both materials closely followed a Hertzian model (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 a-b</xref>), suggesting that under these conditions, PEG is an appropriate physical model for the elasticity of marrow.</p>

<caption><title>Adapting a PEG hydrogel to mimic the physical and chemical properties of bone marrow tissue.</title>
<p>a) Tissues have specific defining physical and chemical properties such as water content, elasticity, integrin-binding, and MMP-degradable proteins. These properties can be quantified in real bone marrow tissue using rheology, mass spectrometry, and tissue histology (body image from Protein atlas). These features are represented synthetically by tuning the hydrogel crosslinking and incorporating biofunctional peptides. c) Here, bone marrow tissue (top left, image from <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>) is mimicked in a hydrogel (bottom left) composed of an 8-arm PEG macromer functionalized with c) 13 mono-functional integrin-binding peptides, and crosslinked with d) 7 di-functional MMP-degradable peptides and a linear PEG-dithiol. The known functional sequence for each peptide is depicted in blue with the percentage it is present in the hydrogel (&#x0025; relative to other peptides). All histology images are representative of each protein in human bone marrow tissue (images from the Protein Atlas). The lines in d) connect each MMP to their known protein substrates and the slash (/) indicates the cleavage location for each enzyme on the matched peptide.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The ECM proteins of marrow were identified using histology and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). ECM proteins were represented by specific peptide sequences that are either responsible for high affinity binding to transmembrane integrin proteins <sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> or are highly susceptible to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Suppl. Table 1 and 2). Integrins are the largest class of cell adhesion receptors that mediate attachment to the ECM and activate intracellular signaling<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Collectively the MMP family can degrade all components of the ECM and is important for tissue homeostasis<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Integrin-binding proteins and MMP protein substrates were identified in human bone marrow using the histology data available in the Protein Atlas (Suppl. Table 3)<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Peptide motifs that elicit integrin binding were identified for each protein and displayed as mono-functional moieties in the hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-c</xref>, Suppl. Table 5-6)<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Conversely, di-functional peptides that selectively degrade in the presence of cell secreted MMPs were associated with the protein substrates found in marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,d</xref>, Suppl. Table 6). The histological scores for each protein were used to determine the quantitative peptide amounts to be included in the final bone marrow hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c-d</xref>). Representative images from the tissue histology in the Protein Atlas are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>. ECM proteins in human bone marrow<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> were analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and compared to control tissues (lung and brain, Suppl. Table 4) to confirm that our histology-driven approach identified the unique ECM signature of marrow. The LC-MS data from human bone marrow was most similar to the bone marrow peptide cocktail (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), and protein substrates from bone marrow ECM could be cleaved by active MMP enzymes (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Together, these data indicated our technique could accurately filter for the unique integrin-binding and MMP-degradable protein signature of marrow.</p>

<title>Functional validation of peptide domains</title>
<p>Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were used to test whether stromal cells, which are highly abundant in the marrow, could recognize and respond appropriately to the peptides in our bone marrow cocktail. We developed a competitive cell adhesion assay to measure binding to integrin peptides, which took advantage of the decrease in cell area observed during cell adhesion (Suppl. Video 1 and 2). We covalently attached the full integrin-binding peptide cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) to a glass coverslip upon which MSCs were seeded in the presence or absence of individual peptides from that same cocktail solubilized in the cell medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We validated that cell adhesion to the surface was driven by the attached peptides, not serum (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and that protein did not passively bind to peptide-coated coverslips in the experimental time frame (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We observed a decrease in the area of cells pre-treated with peptides, so adhesion was quantified using cell area measurements at two hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>

<p>All tested cells had decreased adhesivity when dosed with the bone marrow integrin-binding peptide cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Across three MSC sources from human donors and one immortalized cell line, most individual peptides decreased MSC spreading at the concentration at which they were present in the cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The Collagen I and Tenascin C peptides did not significantly alter MSC adhesion in any case, but promoted an anti-adhesive phenotype in a human breast cancer cell line (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Interestingly, the immortalized MSC cell line was more responsive to individual peptide treatments compared to the donor cells (i.e. more peptides decreased adhesion). Since ECM proteins can facilitate both adhesion to and dissociation from the matrix, and we see those phenotypes in this data, we conclude that each peptide in the mimic can direct cell adhesion to and from our hydrogel matrix.</p>
<p>Crosslinker degradation was validated using a cell invasion assay. Cytodex beads were coated with MSCs and encapsulated for 6 days into the hydrogels crosslinked with a single MMP degradable peptide or the full set of degradable crosslinks at the same molar ratio of thiol to maleimide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). When degradable peptides were present, MSCs were able to branch further into the surrounding network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d-e</xref>). MSCs branched the furthest in the bone marrow-cocktail, MMP-3, and -14 crosslinked hydrogels, suggesting that certain individual peptides can be extremely susceptible to degradation and peptide combinations can improve material degradation by bone marrow cells. Since all the MMP peptides have been optimized to selectively degrade in response to their respective enzyme<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we suggest that MMP expression would likely explain the differential degradation observed. In sum, we observed degradation for all MMP peptide crosslinkers and found that the full bone marrow-inspired degradable peptide cocktail was optimal for MSC branching.</p>

<title>Optimal conditions for coupling marrow-specific peptides</title>
<p>This is the first time 20 unique peptide motifs have been incorporated into a PEG hydrogel. Prior to this work, the most complex bioactive PEG hydrogel contained 3 unique peptides<sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Thus, it was important to identify the ideal conditions to incorporate these peptides into the network. Our peptides are coupled using a Michael-type addition reaction, with a maleimide as the Michael-type acceptor. The maleimide-thiol reaction is biocompatible and has been shown to provide the most efficient incorporation of ligands and the largest range of bulk properties compared to similar PEG hydrogels<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. A thiol quantification assay was used to identify uncoupled peptides in solution because the Michael-type donor for this reaction is a thiol (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). A number of parameters regulated the efficiency of peptide incorporation, including polymer wt&#x0025; and the molar percentage of reactive pairs (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>-e). However, these properties also change the effective Young&#x2019;s modulus of the hydrogel. Overall, we found that an 8-arm PEG enabled increased crosslinking without reducing reaction efficiency (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>

<p>We achieved &#x003E;98&#x0025; coupling of mono-functional integrin-binding peptides and &#x003E;97&#x0025; of di-functional MMP degradable peptides using an 8-arm PEG at 20 wt&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a-b</xref>). Optimal reaction conditions for integrin-binding peptides occurred in PBS at pH 7.4, but we did note that the peptide cocktail was less soluble in this buffer than in DMSO (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>-g). Separately, we reduced a hydrogel using sodium borohydride to ensure that disulfide bonds between the thiols were not preventing the Michael-addition reaction. This reduction did not significantly increase the number of free thiols found, indicating that &#x003E;95&#x0025; of the material bonds are from the Michael-type addition reaction (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>).</p>
<p>Matrix assisted laser deposition ionization time of flight was used to identify the peptides that did not couple to the matrix. First, we made a solution of all the peptides, without PEG present, and identified all except DGEA and AEIDGIEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>-f, Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>-b). These are both highly negatively charged peptides, which do not ionize easily. To confirm this, AEIDGIEL could not be identified even at a high concentration if non-charged peptides were present (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c-f</xref>). We then formed hydrogels with all the peptides, and attempted to find unreacted peptides in solution. Only two peptides were identified in the supernatant but at a significantly reduced intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g-h</xref>). Taken together, this data shows that our peptides are crosslinked into the hydrogel close to the expected concentration.</p>

<title>PEG hydrogels mimic the bulk mechanics of bone marrow</title>
<p>The mechanical properties of engineered materials can influence the migration and differentiation of marrow-derived stromal and hematopoietic stem cells<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that porcine bone marrow has an average modulus of 4.4&#x00B1;1.0 kPa at physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and recent work has shown that hematopoietic progenitor populations can be maintained in the presence of fibronectin at this modulus<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. These studies highlight an important role for the mechanical properties of bone marrow tissue to direct stem cell fate and function. A PEG hydrogel crosslinked with a linear dithiol can be adapted to span the range of stiffness observed in bone marrow (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). While a number of properties contribute to stiffness and can be used to tune modulus, a 20 wt&#x0025;, 8-arm, 20K PEG hydrogel best matched the modulus of porcine bone marrow tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p>
<p>A benefit of PEG hydrogels is the mechanical and chemical properties can be independently tuned. To ensure our chemical modifications did not change the stiffness of the material, we individually incorporated them into the hydrogel and tested each of their effects on stiffness. Incorporation of the MMP-sensitive crosslinkers in lieu of PEG-dithiol did not alter the hydrogel modulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), and mono-functional integrin-binding peptides could be incorporated up to a 4 mM total concentration without compromising the bulk modulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Through separate cell tracing experiments, we found that a 2 mM concentration of integrin-binding peptides was needed to achieve significant MSC spreading at 24 hours. We therefore used 2 mM of total integrin-binding peptides in a 20 wt&#x0025;, 8-arm, 20K PEG crosslinked with our MMP-degradable cocktail as the final bone marrow formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d-e</xref>).</p>

<title>The synthetic bone marrow hydrogel provides a niche for MSC growth and differentiation</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate an approach to identify the matrix stiffness, integrin-binding peptides, and MMP-degradable sites in real bone marrow. This information was used to create a PEG hydrogel with tissue-inspired properties. As a comparison to the current standard for <italic>in vitro</italic> synthetic 3D culture systems, we compared this bone marrow hydrogel to the commonly used RGD-functionalized PEG hydrogel and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). We explored both cell growth and differentiation because these are two phenotypes exhibited by MSCs in real bone. After one week in culture, the same percentage of MSCs expressed Ki67 and p21 on TCPS as in the bone marrow gel, where cells in the RGD-functionalized PEG hydrogel were less proliferative and had increased cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a-c</xref>).</p>

<p>We next explored whether MSCs were differentiating. Interestingly, &#x03B1;-smooth muscle actin was highest in the bone marrow hydrogel, suggesting reduced clonogenicity and fat differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>)<sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. All donor MSCs were capable of differentiating into bone and fat, shown by staining hydroxyapatite or lipids, respectively (Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Differentiation capacity was measured by quantifying the ability of cells to differentiate in the presence or absence of differentiation medium. In the bone marrow hydrogel, MSCs had a higher capacity to differentiate into bone compared to RGD-functionalized hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). In both the RGD-functionalized and bone marrow hydrogels, spontaneous hydroxyapatite formation was observed without the presence of differentiation cues (Suppl. Figure 6). Adipose differentiation was similar in both materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Our results correlate with reports that &#x03B1;-smooth muscle actin positive MSCs filtered from bone marrow have a higher osteogenic differentiation potential<sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this study also found that these cells had a higher <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue regeneration capacity.</p>
<p>This led us to hypothesize that the bone marrow hydrogel provided a niche for MSCs to differentiate and respond to growth factors typically present in the bone milieu that are responsible for MSC activation, differentiation, proliferation, and trafficking<sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. We treated MSCs encapsulated in hydrogels with a panel of proteins associated with either MSC differentiation or proliferation<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. We observed that MSCs encapsulated in the bone marrow hydrogel were more metabolically active when exposed to this panel than when encapsulated in the RGD-functionalized hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). This supports the notion that specific integrin binding in the marrow influences soluble factor signaling.</p>
<p>The described 3D bone marrow hydrogel is highly tunable and can be readily used to probe the underlying mechanisms driving cellular differentiation and phenotypes caused by soluble cues. <italic>In vivo</italic> the bone marrow niche needs to be able to support progenitor populations and to direct cell differentiation, a feature we demonstrate here. Overall, we only observed this unique biological response by combining both the physical and chemical properties of real bone marrow into a PEG hydrogel. While we have focused specifically on bone marrow, this approach could be applied to any tissue in the human body, and represents the next generation of tissue-driven hydrogel design for cell culture.</p>

<title>Outlook</title>
<p>Here, we combined proteomic-based bioinformatics and biomechanics to make a bone marrow-customized PEG hydrogel. This marrow-mimicking hydrogel is composed simply of PEG and peptides, which polymerizes in 10 seconds under physiological conditions. The novelty of our hydrogel is that it includes 20 unique peptide moieties to more fully capture the integrin-binding and MMP sensitive domains of ECM proteins typical of marrow. Competitor hydrogels typically incorporate 1-3 of these types of peptides and approximate native tissue by incorporating tissue-specific cells. Another approach is to implant bone-like scaffolds into mice to recruit cells and then use <italic>ex vivo</italic> culturing to maintain bone marrow cell populations in culture long-term<sup><xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. This latter approach is labor intensive and requires technical expertise to fabricate, limiting its throughput. We also argue that these models under-represent the chemical diversity of native tissue because, while they capture the hierarchical structure of bone, they neglect the unique protein properties present in bone marrow.</p>
<p>Decellularized matrix is currently the only <italic>in vitro</italic> material capable of including the protein complexity of real tissue<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. It is time consuming to make and not batch-controlled, leading to inconsistent results and an inability to separate ensuing variability between the cells and the starting material. Tissue-specific cells can also be made to secrete their own matrix for cell culture use, but this matrix is not necessarily representative of the native environment<sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. As an alternative, we demonstrate an approach to synthetically represent the tissue-specific properties of bone marrow, while maintaining control and simplicity. One appeal of this system is that it could be used to co-culture cells or be formed around any cell or organoid of interest<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Additionally, because features can easily be tuned, pseudo ECM knock-out environments can be used to understand ECM-mediated cell signaling. Future work should focus on a more thorough understanding of how each component of the ECM, and how perturbations of these properties, contributes to and changes observed cell phenotypes. In sum, we have captured the ECM of real bone marrow using simple chemistry in a widely-used material that is adaptable to high throughput, systems-level screens<sup><xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. We propose this approach could be applied to any tissue or organ, creating a new class of designer biomaterials that can be employed to elucidate ECM-driven mechanisms in cells not easily achieved by other systems.</p>
