<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacterial blight in pomegranate caused by <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>punicae</italic> (<italic>Xap</italic>) is an increasing threat for pomegranate cultivation in India. To prevent the economic losses, it is pivotal to detect the infection in latent stages rather than in later stages. We have developed an enhanced method termed as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to evaluate for the latent detection of Xap in pomegranate using six set of specific primers. Three DNA intercalating dyes were used, such as Ethidium bromide, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and SYBR Green resulted in visualising the positivity for LAMP assay. The reaction time and temperature were to be 65&#x00B0;C from 30 min onwards, for the dyes and its sensitivity was observed up to 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup> ng in the LAMP assay. For field applicability, LAMP assay detected Xap on 7<sup>th</sup> day post infection while the PCR amplified Xap after 11<sup>th</sup> day post infection. Finally, the specificity of LAMP assay was validated to be positive with ten Xap isolates for its accuracy and 29 non-Xap bacterial isolates showed negative results. Moreover, this method could be used as a better alternative to PCR based methods, for early detection of the pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pomegranate (<italic>Punica granatum</italic> L.) is an important fruit crop widely cultivated from tropical to temperate conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. India ranks first in the world for maximum area under pomegranate cultivation (0.125 million hectares) and Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the major pomegranate growing states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The bacterial blight caused by <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>punicae</italic> (Xap) in pomegranate was first reported in India in 1952 and presently it has a serious outbreak in all major pomegranate-growing states resulting in a major economic loss. Prominent small water-soaked and dark irregular spots appearing on the leaf are the typical symptoms induced by this pathogen. The pathogen infect the fruit, stem, branches causing cracking symptoms and ultimately leads to yield loss up to 80 percent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Globally, it is estimated that a minimum 30-40&#x0025; of the crop cultivated gets destroyed annually due to pests and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In India, bacterial blight alone reduces the yield between 60 to 80 percent above global yield loss in pomegranate. To avoid yield loss, it is very important and necessary to develop an efficiently sensitive pathogen detection method within incubation time of the pathogen (i.e. time between the host infection and expression of the disease symptoms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The most common methods employed for detecting the plant pathogens include immunological techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] and molecular methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and Southern blotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The methods for early detection of the plant pathogens in the field has to be designed in such a way that it has to be competently very sensitive, specific, cost-effective and detectable with a minimal equipment facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. For instance, the PCR based technique has its own drawbacks which require high quality and quantity of DNA and amplification is complex that requires a thermal cycler for changing the reaction temperature and requires relatively long time for the amplification process to complete. Further, it also requires agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation to confirm the amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. To overcome these limitations, researchers have shown interest in developing an isothermal amplification technique termed as Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. LAMP is an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis technique, which is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require a thermal-cycler. The amplification is completed within 30-60 minutes at a constant temperature of 60-65&#x00B0; C, which can be carried out in a simple water bath or heating block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Moreover, LAMP is a cost effective and it does not require a thermal cycler and electrophoretic unit, as the result can be inferred as positive or negative with the colour change or turbidity observed by naked eye without spending much time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The favorable target for bacterial pathogen diagnostic includes mainly, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene which is been widely used to identify the bacterial species among different bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This diversity is unique for species and their sequences are presented inside their nine (V1 - V9) hypervariable regions which constitutes useful targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These regions are highly conserved stretches in bacteria, which facilitates the identification through PCR amplification using universal primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In principle, the LAMP assay recognizes six specifically designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences from the target bacterial DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. It consists of two outer primers (F3 and B3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP), a loop-forward (LF) and a loop-backward (LB). These six primers ensure a high specificity for target DNA amplification. Moreover, these primers enable generation of a stem-loop DNA for subsequent complex LAMP amplification, which includes self-priming reaction. A mixture of DNA, differing in the number of loops and length of the stem-loop is produced as a final product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. By considering the advantages of LAMP assay, which is widely used to detect broad range of microorganisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The present study was aimed to detect the bacterial blight of pomegranate in early stages with minimum pathogen DNA template by optimizing several DNA intercalating dyes with lower temperature in a shorter time with less technical skills.</p>

<title>Crude method</title>
<p>To test the cost effectivity and latent detection of bacterial blight pathogen, the DNA was isolated from the leaf sample collected from glass house, using a modified crude method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]without the use of centrifuge and other instruments. The crude extract was used as a template for LAMP assay as well as PCR reaction setup. The leaf sample collected from glass house was surface sterilized with 0.1&#x0025; mercuric chloride for about 30 to 90 seconds, later the leaf was washed thrice with sterile water to remove any residues of mercuric chloride. The infected plants tissue were immersed in the tube containing 500 &#x03BC;L of STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris and 50 mM EDTA) for 10 minutes and similarly for other tubes 50 &#x03BC;Lof pure cultures (Xap and other bacterial non Xap spp.) was added. The tubes were vigorously mixed to form the uniform solution of bacteria, 500 &#x03BC;L of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1) was added and mixed vigorously and allowed to stand till the aqueous and organic phase separated. Then the supernatant was collected (containing genomic DNA) into new sterile tube for further analysis.</p>

<title>Optimization and Sensitivity of LAMP assay</title>
<p>The LAMP reactions were carried out to optimize a single temperature for greater efficiency. The reaction was performed at different temperatures ranging from 60 to 65&#x00B0;C.

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Validation for specificity</title>
<p>It is very important to validate the LAMP assay and its dyes with respect to its specificity (only Xap) and accuracy (among the Xap samples). To analyze the accuracy, we have used 10 isolates of Xap and 29 non Xap isolates of bacteria isolated from the same source, pomegranate. Isolates with each dye were compared using completely randomized block design to identify the significant difference by Pairwise Mean Comparison on the variants using Duncan&#x2019;s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). Moreover, each isolate was checked with all the dyes for the ten isolates using one sample &#x2018;t&#x2019; test. Statistical tool (R version 3.4.3) was used to find the significant differences in both DMRT and one sample &#x2018;t&#x2019; test.</p>

<title>Optimization of LAMP assay using different dyes</title>
<p>A total of 10 Xap isolates (Xap1 to Xap10) were used to optimize the LAMP assay. Colour differentiation between positive and negative assays for the detection of Xap was the main criteria for selection of different dyes. Three DNA intercalating dyes (Ethidium bromide, Hydroxynaphthol blue and SYBR Green) were used in the LAMP assay. The primers were designed from the sequence of 16S rRNA of Xap1 isolate. The dyes EtBr, HNB, and SYBR green were found to be optimum for LAMP assay based on their feasibility in detection <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. To determine the optimum temperature and reaction time of LAMP assay, a short range of temperature (60&#x00B0;C - 65&#x00B0;C) was used to analyse the highest fluorescent intensity and time (15 min - 90 min) using high quality DNA of Xap1 isolate. LAMP assay was positive for all the three dyes (EtBr, HNB, SYBR Green) used with respect to various levels of temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4a</xref>). EtBr showed the highest fluorescent intensity with increase in temperature compared to other dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4b</xref>) which was also assessed on 2&#x0025; agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4c</xref>) and the fluorescent intensity was also measured simultaneously. Amplification was not observed at 15 min incubation time and positive LAMP results were observed 30 min onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4d</xref>) and further it was reconfirmed on 2&#x0025; agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4e</xref>). The highest fluorescent intensity was recorded at 75 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4f</xref>) for each dye. Therefore, Xap can be best detected using EtBr under an optimized condition at 65&#x00B0; C from 30 minutes onwards under UV light. The fluorescent intensity was decreased to half of that of EtBr when the assay was directly visualised using HNB dye without UV-detector.</p>

<title><italic>In planta</italic> detection</title>
<p>This study aimed to detect Xap by LAMP assay at the early crop stage where the leaf was mechanically pricked with bacterial blight pathogen to inoculate it to healthy pomegranate plants. Three months old pomegranate plant (Bhagwa va.) was grown under controlled environment in a glass house with 85&#x0025; humidity. Xap1 bacterial culture was resuspended in sterile water and inoculated on healthy plants using pin prick method. The prominent symptoms were observed from the 11<sup>th</sup> day after post inoculation, the oily lesions on the leaf surface were observed, which are characteristic symptoms of the bacterial blight disease. The crude DNA isolation method was followed to isolate DNA from the inoculated plants, every alternative day. After the pathogen infectivity in the healthy plants, LAMP assay in agarose gel showed positive from 7<sup>th</sup> day onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7b</xref>) and for visualizing all the three dyes showed positive LAMP results from the 7<sup>th</sup> day onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7a</xref>), in which the EtBr viewed to be most prominent comparing with other and its absorbance intensity was increased with days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7d</xref>).

<title>DISCUSSIONS</title>
<p>This study aimed to show case the importance of LAMP in an early detection of pathogen. Early detection of plant pathogens could possibly result successful disease management for the crop. The spread of the pathogen namely <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>punicae</italic> is emerging as massive threat to the pomegranate cultivators, worldwide. The early detection of the pathogen (Xap) in pomegranate was attempted with LAMP assay which address a better alternative than the conventional PCR method, which are eventually highly reliable, cost-effective, very sensitive, more specific and rapid. The early detection would mainly benefit to diagnose and minimize the crop damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. PCR based detection is highly reliable on high quality DNA with high quantity of template, typically 1 ng to 1000 ng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The flow of our LAMP assay is diagrammatically described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref>.</p>

<caption><title>Overall workflow involved in the LAMP assay.</title>
<p>Step <bold>1</bold>. The FIP region segregates into F2 region at the 3&#x2019;end and F1c region at the 5&#x2019;end.the F2 region hybridizes to F2c of the target and further initiates the synthesis of complementary strand. Step <bold>2</bold>. The loop formed at 5&#x2019; end acts as a template for BIP region. Once B2 hybridizes to B2c of the template, DNA synthesis is initiated resulting in the formation of complementary strand and opening of the 5&#x2019; end loop. Step <bold>3</bold>. Outer primer B3 hybridizes to B3c region of the target and elongates, resulting in the formation of a dumbbell shaped DNA. Step <bold>4</bold>. The dumbbell shaped DNA, now converts to a stem loop structure. The FIP hybridizes to form a loop of the stem-loop DNA structure to initiate LAMP cycling. Strand synthesis is started. The F1 strand is displaced to form a new loop at the 3&#x2019; end. Step <bold>5</bold>. The elongation takes place displacing the FIP strand, which once again forms a dumbbell, shaped DNA. Step <bold>6</bold>. The obtained products then serves as template for the BIP primed strand displacement reaction in the subsequent cycles. The final products obtained are a mixture of stem loop DNA with various stem lengths structures with multiple loops.</p></caption>

<p>We have amplified Xap using Xap-specific primers with a minimum template concentration of 1.53 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> ng in PCR. While our LAMP assay amplification was recorded in agarose gel till a least concentration of 1.53 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup> ng. Report on bacterial pathogen by Jun-hai <italic>et al.</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] detected bacterial blight caused by <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>dieffenbachiae</italic> infecting Anthurium in LAMP which had sensitivity of 1 fg, which is 100 times less sensitive when compared to our detection by LAMP assay on Xap. Sensitivity was comparably high in our method as we have used LAMP primers designed from 16S rRNA sequence, which could detect the pathogen even with low amount of 10 copies of genetic material[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In our study, we have used 10 Xap isolates and all assays were positive with LAMP dyes. There could always be a minute chance that the PCR method could amplify from some non-specifically primed reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], so with these criterias, we used 29 non-Xap isolates in LAMP assay which resulted negative and thus it turned out to be highly specific and reliable method to detect Xap samples.</p>
<p>DNA intercalating dyes resulted in detection of pathogens in LAMP assay without performing gel electrophoresis. Most reports in LAMP assay involve EtBr dye for visualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Even though, it is a highly hazardous and showed closely similar sensitivity when compared to most of the florescent dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. We used SYBR Green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] which is less mutagenic when compared to EtBr[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Both resulted same sensitivity level but EtBr resulted twice more in florescence intensity. We also used HNB dye to visualize through naked eye, which showed the same sensitivity level for EtBr and SYBR Green but the fluorescence intensity was comparably low.</p>
<p>LAMP reaction produces massive amount of amplification as many as 10<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>10</sup> copies of the target regions within an hour,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] as a result cross contamination could be generated only when indicator dye was added after the reaction like EtBr and SYBR Green. The DNA intercalators are small molecules that can reversibly bind in between the adjacent base pairs of a double-stranded DNA. The intercalating dyes binds to the dsDNA causing the nucleic acid to become fluorescent and therefore readily detected under UV light. EtBr and SYBR Green are intercalating agents which binds between the nucleotide pairs and fluoresce when exposed to UV light.</p>
<p>LAMP is highly sensitive and negligible amount of target DNA can also be effectively detected from the colour change. Hydroxy napthol blue (HNB), which is a colorimetric indicator of calcium and alkaline earth metal ions. Since HNB is added in the LAMP reaction prior to the process, the colour gradually changes from violet to blue as the dNTP&#x2019;s decreases as amplification takes place. So, using dyes like HNB prior to the preceding LAMP reaction tubes can be ideal to prevent a chance of wrong detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>For field level application, remote laboratories may not be well equipped where LAMP detection technique can be employed in diagnosis of pathogens. This assay can even detect Xap in much earlier crop stage than the traditional PCR method. In our greenhouse study after Xap inoculation the LAMP assay detected Xap on 7<sup>th</sup> day while, PCR method detected from 10<sup>th</sup> day onwards. However, the prominent symptoms of Xap infection on the leaf in the glass house study appeared only after 10<sup>th</sup> day of inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>)</p>
<p>Improvised field applications such as working with crude extracts from plants with minimal requirement will enhance the importance of the assay for rapid and accurate detection of the pathogens. Unlike most of the methods which involve complete DNA purification for LAMP assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], we used crude extract of the leaf sample for detection of Xap. In conclusion, with crude extraction and safer dyes with minimum equipment, our study has shown a scope to develop LAMP isothermal kit which could be handy in the fields for early detection of the disease and to adopt appropriate management strategies.</p>
