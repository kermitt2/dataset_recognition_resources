<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We present an approach to estimating the nature of the Waddington (or epigenetic) landscape that underlies a population of individual cells. Through exploiting high resolution single cell transcription experiments we show that cells can be located on a landscape that reflects their differentiated nature.</p>
<p>Our approach makes use of probabilistic non-linear dimensionality reduction that respects the topology of our estimated epigenetic landscape. In simulation studies and analyses of real data we show that the approach, known as topslam, outperforms previous attempts to understand the differentiation landscape.</p>
<p>Hereby, the novelty of our approach lies in the correction of distances <italic>before</italic> extracting ordering information.This gives the advantage over other attempts, which have to correct for extracted time lines by post processing or additional data</p>

<p>High-throughput single-cell real-time polymerase chain reaction gene expression measurements (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Section S2</xref>) are new and promising techniques to give insights into the heterogeneous development of individual cells in organism tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. However, interpretation of measurements can be highly challenging.</p>
<p>Waddington [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] proposed an analogy for understanding the process of differentiation, known as Waddington&#x2019;s landscape or the <italic>epigenetic landscape</italic>. The analogy is based around the idea that differentiated cells are located at different points on the epigenetic landscape with particular paths through the landscape more likely than others due to itsunderlying topology. Think of a map of an alpine area, historically populations became isolated in valleys and differentiated. Topology and location are key aspects of the analogy.</p>
<p>Visualisation of such landscapes is an important aid to biologists involved in studying the evolution of individual cells either in development or cancer. In this paper we reconstruct such landscapes from rich phenotype information from each of the individual cells. In particular, we extract maps of the epigenetic landscape given the observations of <italic>gene expression</italic>.</p>
<p>The mathematical underpinnings of mapping involve a projection from a low dimensional space to a higher dimensional space. Classically we might wish to project the three dimensionalworld around us down to two dimensions for use as a map or a chart. Formally this involves amapping, f(&#x00B7;) from the positions in the two dimensional space, x, to our measurements, y:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="057778_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In epigenetic landscapes, rather than considering the high dimensional measurements to be direct measurements of the physical world around us, we instead observe a rich phenotype, such as the gene expression of an individual cell, y. Our aim is to develop a coherent map such that the position of each cell, x, is consistent with cells that are expressing a similar phenotype. In other words, if two cells have a similar gene expression they should be located near to each other in the map, just as two people located near to each other in a real landscape would have a similar view.</p>
<p>The utility of a map is given by the precision in which it can be recreated. Geographic surveys were originally created through triangulation and laborious ground level surveys. The challenges we face for the epigenetic landscape are somewhat greater. In particular the measurements of phenotype are subject to a great deal of noise, particularly in single cell experiments, in other words there is a mistiness to the observations. Further, we cannot access all areas. We can only query individual cells as to their particular phenotype, we cannot move around the landscape at will. Finally, there is a complex, most likely non-linear relationship between any location on the map which is unknown.</p>
<p>We are inspired by challenges in robotics: in robot navigation a robot facing a landscape for the first time needs to continually assess its current position (the values of x) and simultaneously update its estimate of the map (the function <italic>f</italic> (&#x00B7;)). This challenge is known as as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]).</p>
<p>For example Ferris <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] showed how simultaneous localisation and mapping could be formed by measuring the relative strength of different WiFiaccess points as it moves around a building. When you are near to a given access point you will receive a strong signal, when far, a weak signal. If two robots both perceive a particular access point to have a strong signal they are likely to be near each other. We can think of the WiFiaccess points as landmarks. In our case landmarks are the (noisy) gene expression measurements. If two cells have a similar set of gene expression measurements they are also likely to be near each other. A further challenge for our algorithm is that gene expression measurements are very high dimensional and can be extremely noisy. Because of the analogy to SLAM algorithms and our use of topology to develop the landscape we refer to our approach as <italic>topslam</italic> (topologically aware simultaneous localisation and mapping).</p>
<p>The relationship between the epigenetic landscape and the observed data is dependent on a complex set of interactions between transcription factors, genes and epigenomic modifications. Unpicking the mechanism behind this relationship is extremely challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Instead we propose an alternative, data driven approach based on machine learning algorithms and judicious application of probabilistic methods.</p>
<p>Quantitative determination of single-cell gene expression is commonly used to determine the&#x2014;known to be heterogeneous&#x2014;differentiation process of cells in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] or in the early development of multicell organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The measurement of single cells, however, can give rise to systematically introduced errors in the identification of sub processes in the cell and in the assignment of cells to their specific cell-lines. This is due to the low amounts of mRNA available in single cells: the mRNA requires amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR, see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]).</p>
<p>These technical limitations complicate analysis: they introduce non-linear effects and systematic errors. So as promising as high throughput methods are, they require sophisticated analyses to resolve confounding factors. By providing the scientist with the underlying Waddington landscape for cells in a given experiment, along with the location of each cell in the landscape, we hope to significantly simplify this process. Unpicking the nature of the genetic landmarks in the presence of noise typically exploits <italic>feature extraction</italic>, where high dimensional gene expression data has its dimensionality reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], often through linear techniques. However, it is difficult to determine the number of dimensions to use for further analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>

<title>Dimensionality Reduction</title>
<p>Dimensionality reduction gives a view on the landscape of the underlying biological system. To perform dimensionality reduction we need a mathematical model that extracts the salient aspects of the data without exhibiting vulnerability to confounding factors such as technical or biological noise.</p>
<p>Probabilistic models aim to trade off the useful structure with the confounding variation through specifying probability distributions for each component. We consider non-linear probabilistic models that not only model the landscape as a non-linear surface (think of an irregular skiing piste, in which you want to turn into the flat bits, as opposed to a flat beginners slope, where you can just go in a straight line), but also allow us to determine the dimensionality necessary to explain the gene expression variation, while explaining away the noise through a separate model component.</p>
<p>Linear methods can also be given probabilistic underpinnings, but they suffer from the severe constraint of only allowing the landscape to be linearly related to the genetic landmarks. Conversely deterministic (i.e. non-probabilistic) non-linear methods do not offer a principled approach to separating the confounding variation from the landscape&#x2019;s underlying structure. It can be hard to grasp topographical relationships due to the deterministic nature of the technique. Either additional data or additional correctional deterministic algorithms are necessary for a coherent mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We make use of the Bayesian Gaussian process latent variable model (Bayesian GPLVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]), a probabilistic dimensionality reduction technique that extracts the relevant dimensionalityof the latent embedding as well as expressing a non-linear model. Further, we make use of the <italic>geometry</italic> of the underlying map by exploiting recent advances in metricsfor <italic>probabilistic</italic> geometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>

<title>PCA and Graph Maps</title>
<p>An approach such as principal component analysis (PCA) makes an assumption of a <italic>linear</italic> relationship between the high dimensional measurements and the cell&#x2019;s location in the landscape. This limiting assumption is normally alleviated by proceeding in a two step manner. First PCA is done for all data, then the locations in the linear map are clustered and a further PCA is applied to each cluster separately, giving one coordinate system per cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] for an elegant implementation of this approach).</p>
<p>Islam <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] developed a graph based method, using similarities of cell profiles to characterise two different cell types in a so called &#x201C;graph map&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The underlying probabilistic dimensionality reduction technique has been successfully used in other applications to single cell transcriptomics data, e.g. for visualisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], to uncover sub populations of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and to uncover transcriptional networks in blood stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Our topslam approach is a generalisation of the idea of &#x201C;graph maps&#x201D;: Waddington&#x2019;s landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] can be seen as a non-linear map for the branching process of cells, where the cell process is described as a ball rolling down a hill following stochastically (by e.g. cell stage distribution) the valleys of the hillside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The novelty of our approach is to not correct <italic>after</italic> extraction of graph information, but to correct the distance the graph extraction <italic>uses to extract</italic> information. We can do that by estimating the underlying Waddington landscape along differentiation of cells.</p>

<title>Independent Component Analysis and Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction</title>
<p>Recovery of the epigenetic landscape as an intermediate step facilitates the extraction of other characteristics of interest, such as pseudotime, in cell stage development. For example Trapnell <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] apply independent component analysis (ICA, see e.g.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]) on the gene expression experiment matrix to develop a low dimensional representation of the processes. They then build a minimal spanning tree (MST) on the distances developed from the resulting latent representation to reconstruct a Waddington&#x2019;s landscape given byICA. After some correction, if there are branching processes, they report the longest pathsalongthe MST as the pseudotime backbone and the summed distances as the pseudotime orderingforeach cell. However, this method relies on having rough estimates of the capture time to induce the ordering in the pseudotime estimate. Our probabilistic description of Waddington&#x2019;s landscape relieves this requirement and allows for post analysis of data sets which do not provide such estimates.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

We want to be in the valleys of this landscape (akin valleys of mountains). The time is then extracted along the cells such that it follows thelandscape, depicted as splitting arrows. This also reflects the separate cell fates in the epigenetic progression of the cells.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="057778_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Other methods apply deterministic non-linear dimensionality reductions and attempt to recover the underlying pseudotime in a probabilistic framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The Wanderlust algorithm applies the t-SNE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the expression matrix and then proceeds by averaging over <italic>k</italic>-nearest-neighbour graph ensembles to extractpseudotimes.</p>
<p>Usually now other methods employ heuristics or additional data about capture times to correct for distances in the extracted landscape. For this, they rely on euclidean distances between cells to overlay the extraction method of pseudo time (usually graphs, on which to go along). For us, we can employ non euclidean distances in the landscape, following the topography of the probabilistic landscape to use in the graph, which can correct for outliers, which will be identified by the landscape&#x2019;s topography.</p>
<p>A Riemannian geometry distorts distances, just as in a real map movement is not equally easy in all directions (it is easier to go down hill or follow roads) the underlying Waddington landscape has a topology which should be respected. Topslam landscapes are both non-linear and probabilistic and we correct, locally, for Riemannian distortions introduced by the non-linear surfaces. In the next section we will show how the combination of these three characteristics allows us to recover pseudotime <italic>without</italic> reliance on additional data or additional (correctional) algorithms for graph extraction, to correct for the underlying dimensionality reduction technique used.</p>
<p>In summary we introduce a probabilistic approach to inferring Waddington landscapes and we consider the topological constraints of that landscape. In the next section we show how this idea can be used to improve pseudotime recovery for single cell data.</p>

<title>Application: Pseudotime Recovery</title>
<p>Single cell gene expression experiments provide unprecedented access to the underlying processes and intrinsic functional relationships of and between cells. However, looking at single cells the extracted gene expression is prone to the heterogeneous variability from cell-to-cell. Such noise is not only technical (such as low amounts of RNA, dropout events etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]), but also biological in origin (heterogeneity between cells of the same type).</p>
<p>Each cell is a functioning member of a local community of cells. Biology is based on an evolutionary progression, in which old systems are usually kept in place, when new ones are found. This introduces a lot of redundancies in such processes and makes extraction of information and evidence complex. Therefore, we use dimensionality reduction techniques to optimise and visualise the underlying landscape of the biological process.</p>
<p>Epigenetic progression is a discrete process that Waddington suggested could be visualised as part of a continuous landscape. However, the relationship between location on the landscape and the measured state of the cell is unlikely to be <italic>linear</italic>.</p>
<p>Further, when mapping natural landscapes, a laborious process of triangulation through high precision measurements is used to specify the map accurately. In the epigenetic landscape, no such precision is available. As a result it is vital that we sustain an estimate of our <italic>uncertainty</italic> about the nature of the landscape as we develop the map.</p>

<title>Simulation and Validation</title>
<p>Simulation was done by simulating 5 differentiation patterns of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). We then extracted pseudotime orderings of the cells in the simulation from 10 repetitions of creating gene expression measurements driven by the simulateddifferentiation patters (details Supplementary S1).</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<label>2.1.1</label>
<title>Simulation Results</title>
<p>We compare extracted pseudotime orderings of all three methods in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Plotted are the linear regression correlation coefficients <italic>&#x03C1;</italic> between simulated and extracted time lines. From the simulation studies we can extract, that we can fully reconstruct the simulated time at an average correlation of approximately 91&#x0025;[&#x00B1;4&#x0025;] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This is more then 10&#x0025; higher correlation then the next best method Wanderlust (at 78&#x0025; [&#x00B1;18&#x0025;]). The construction of Waddington&#x2019;s landscape ensures an improvement over the other methods in all simulated latent spaces, even if the intrinsic signal structure suits the other methods. Additionally, the consistency of our result is higher across the experiments, providing more reliable results over multiple experiments.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="057778_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The simulation results show, that topslam is robust to repetition and differences in underlying surfaces, whereas the other methods fail in certain circumstances, especially when the underlying differentiation process gets complex (more branching). Thus, it is crucial to account for the topography of the dimensionality reduction technique, before extracting intrinsic signals (such as pseudotime) from the rich phenotypic characterisations of cells.</p>
<p>We also show, that we can use topslam to overlay a probabilistic Waddington&#x2019;s landscape over the other dimensionality reduction techniques. This enables a corrected extraction of pseudotime estimates. This correction is shown to be never detrimental and can increasethe correlation between extracted and simulated pseudotimes (Supplementary S1). The supplementary material also contains results for a range of other dimensionality reduction techniques.</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<label>2.1.2</label>
<title>Running Time</title>
<p>Our probabilistic treatment of landscape recovery and our principled correction of the topology mean that topslam is the slowest of the three approaches. The other two methods only apply heuristic corrections, gaining speed in the estimation of intrinsic signal ordering. Topslam averages at approximately 230s of run time to learn the landscape for the simulated 400-500 cells. (The number of genes does not play a significant role during optimisation, because of pre-computation of the empirical covariance matrix.) Wanderlust averages at approximately 40s and Monocle at only 5<italic>s</italic>. However, as we&#x2019;ve seen this faster compute comes at the expense of a significant loss of both accuracy and consistency. We now turn to deployment of topslam on real data.</p>

<p>In this section we explore the performance of topslam on to real single cell qPCR (Supplementary S2.1) and single cell RNA-seq (Supplementary S2.2) experiments. This shows the ability for topslam to extract intrinsic signals for existing and difficult single cell profiling techniques, which can bare difficulties because of high noise corruption and systematic errors (dropouts, detection limit etc.).</p>

<title>Mouse Embryonic Development Landscape</title>
<p>We extract the pseudotime for a mouse embryonic single cell qPCR experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] of 437 cells, captured from one to 64 cell-state. In this experiment 48 genes where captured. We learn a landscape for the cells progression along time, capturing the differentiation process. The landscape then defines the progression of time by following the valleys of the topography, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Extracting the progression landscape from a qPCR single cell gene expression experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] reveals the time line for the single cell progression in fine grained detail. We extractthe landscape for the developmental cells and compute distances along the landscape through an embedded graph.</p>
<p>The starting cell needs to be given, whereas no more information is needed to extract the progression of (pseudo-) time along the graph. It is recommended to provide a leaf node in the graph, to ensure only one direction of time along Waddington&#x2019;s landscape. We can now use the extracted time to infer differing progression of gene expression through the progression of cells. In this particular data set we have a differentiation progress at hand, cells differentiating into three different cell states in the 64 cell stage: trophectoderm (TE), epiblast (EPI), and primitive endoderm (PE).</p>
<p>We use the same labelling of Guo <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which introduces some systematic errors (as explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1a">Section 1.1</xref>). With this differentiation, we can now plot gene expression along the landscape, revealing the dynamics of gene expression during differentiation and elucidating differentiation processes within different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Using the extracted pseudotime for different pathways in the cell stages, we can elucidate the differentiation process along time. We perform differential gene expression detection in time series experiments (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]), and use the top ten differentially expressed genes as marker genes for the three cell stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We compiled the list as a comparison between stages, thus if a gene is duplicated in the comparison of stages it is a marker gene for the differentiation of the one stage from the two others (see e.g. for TE <italic>Id2, Tspan8</italic>). The differentiation takes place in the 16 and 32 cell stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Having the time series as differential expressed marker genes, we can plot the exact time line of when genes get differentially expressed along pseudo time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison with results using other dimensionality reduction techniques, show that the other methods are not able to capture the non-linearities in the data (topslam is our method,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We can also see the representation of Waddington&#x2019;s landscape as shaded area, we want to stay in light areas.</p>

<p>Deng <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] perform an exploratory single cell RNA-seq experiment for allele specific gene expression. They find significant differences between paternal and maternal developmental development in split-cell experiments (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] for details). Performinga PCA on the extracted Gene Expression Experiment reveals the overall time structure from oocyte to blastocyst. However, PCA fails to recover the differences in monoallelic expression (See PCA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Generating a probabilistic Waddington&#x2019;s landscape for this experiment not only reveals the dynamics of overall pre-implantation development, but also it enables us to distinguish between split-cells and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Suggestively there may also be a closer relationship between the split-cells and adult cells, although given that similarity with early development cells is unlikely to be great, that conclusion should be treated with some caution.</p>
<p>Again, the probabilistic representation of Waddington&#x2019;s landscape reveals a detailed description of the cells developmental progression. It picks out sub populations in the cells, which were not visible by other dimensionality reduction techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Human Developmental Landscape</title>
<p>In this experiment Yan <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] looked for connections between human embryonic stem cell gene expression and pre-implantation embryo gene expression. We use the data set to show the embryonic developmental landscape in humans, by extracting the probabilistic representation of Waddington&#x2019;s landscape of the one cell state, through the late blastocyst stage to human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="057778_fig8.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Again, comparing our representation to other dimensionality reduction techniques (Fig. S11) reveals the ability of the probabilistic modelling to capture the underlying time structure of the cells. (Heavy filtering was done to select only highly variable genes, this removed the very large number of dropout events and low expressed genes (See supplementary material S4.2,S1).)</p>
<p>We extract the landscape and pseudotimes along the graph (Fig. S10). This enables us to consider other analyses such as time-series clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Such studies could further unravel processes on a genetic level.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. To validate the clusters we performed a gene ontology association study shown on the right of the cluster distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). These clusters are referring to the hESC cells as a follow up stage after the late blastocyst, as the topography of the Waddington landscape suggests.</p>
<p>The gene ontology associations show that the hESC cell stage genes are up regulated towards ribosomal activity and RNA activity. Genes up regulated towards the end of the pre-implantation cell stages (late blastocyst) are associated with RNA splicing and mRNA metabolic processes. We used the goatools toolbox to perform the gene ontology analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. With topslam we are able to resemble results found in Yan <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], without the need for additional statistical filtering, such as anova or mean analysis. We are able to directly model the connection between time and genes employing probabilistic correction and modelling. This gives the advantage of providing more power, as more data points can be employed in the analysis.</p>

<p>Using topslam allows us to extract an actual time line along which we can do further studies. We do not have to employ binning procedures, which can introduce systematic errors and reduce statistical power.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have introduced a probabilistic approach to inferring Waddington landscapes. We use rich phenotype information to characterise the landscape and probabilistic inference techniques to infer a non-linear mapping from the landscape to the phenotype. Our approach allows us to respect the topology of the landscape when extracting distances and we show the advantages of this idea when reconstructing pseudotimes from single cell data. Summarising single cells in this manner represents a powerful approach for understanding the evolution of their genetic profile, a critical stage in understanding development and cancer.</p>

<title>Topslam Approach</title>
<p>Crucially standard approaches each miss at least one important component of the mapping problem. Monocle assumes a linear map, a highly unrealistic assumption. Wanderlust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] makes use of a non-linear method but does not consider the <italic>topography</italic> of the map when developing pseudotime orderings. The topography of the epigenetic landscape influences distances between cells on the landscape, and therefore their effective relative positions to each other.</p>
<p>Our approach, a topologically corrected simultaneous localisation and mapping of cells, topslam, proposes to make use of a <italic>probabilistic non-linear</italic> dimensionality reduction technique, also used in many other single cell transcriptomics applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The probabilistic nature of the dimensionality reduction technique is used for extracting the Waddington landscapes <italic>with</italic> associated uncertainties. Further, we are able to take account of the local topography when extracting pseudotimes, correcting distances by applying non euclidean metrics along the landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>To perform pseudotime extraction with topslam we build a minimum spanning tree (or k-nearest-neighbour graph) along the latent landscape uncovered by topslam. This allows the spanning tree to naturally follow the landscape topography and makes any corrections post extraction obsolete. For a more detailed description of the approach see supplementary material [S3,S4].</p>
