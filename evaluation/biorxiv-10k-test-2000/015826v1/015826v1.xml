<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>In developing embryos of eukaryotes, varying concentrations and/or duration of exposure to morphogens induce and repress transcription factors (TFs) in a regular order, thereby acting as signals for cell differentiation. I present a chemical thermodynamic model for the formation and degradation of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the major TFs involved in dorsal-ventral patterning of the vertebrate neural tube. This two-stage model first considers introduction of Shh into a chemically defined (oxidizing) environment. As the system is driven away from metastable equilibrium, the TFs progressively become more stable than Shh, as indicated by comparison of the calculated overall energies of formation (chemical affinity). In the second stage, a gradual return to metastable equilibrium with Shh drives transitions in the relative stabilities of the TFs that follow the experimental patterns of TF expression. At the intracellular level, the major proteins in the signal transduction network show a metastability progression among reactions of Shh and its cell-surface receptor and the intracellular Gli proteins that act as activators and repressors of transcription. If the endocytosis and degradation of receptor-ligand complexes are coupled to localized protein translation, the consequent thermodynamic constraints may represent a high-level source of specificity that coexists with molecular mechanisms of signal transduction.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The formation and operation of living systems are made possible only by coupling with a source of energy. In isolation, according to the second law of thermodynamics, a system necessarily departs from an organized, living state. It was recognized by at least the 1920s that many living beings are sustained by the available or &#x201C;free&#x201D; energy released by oxidation reactions maintained at non-equilibrium states in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller, 2008</xref>). The persistence of open, non-equilibrial living systems has been posited as the central observation demanding explanation at the fundamental level in the theory of biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scheiner, 2010</xref>), and there is continuing interest in biological applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamic models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Prigogine and Nicolis, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bizzarri et al., 2013</xref>). The outlook on this state of affairs is quite broadly expressed by statements such as &#x201C;equilibrium is death&#x201D; (attributed to William Bayliss; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller, 2008</xref>) and &#x201C;chemical equilibrium means death&#x201D; (Jacques Monod, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Judson, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Does this mean that questions of &#x201C;where is equilibrium?&#x201D; and &#x201C;how far is equilibrium?&#x201D; are irrelevant to biological studies? This problem is like the difference between explaining how an airplane works using concepts of thrust, lift and drag &#x2013; questions of dynamics, clearly in the domain of nonequilibrium, and describing how far it is above Earth&#x2019;s surface, and the bearing to its destination. The latter statements, describing the current state of the plane in reference to its surroundings, are based in equilibrium notions. Equilibrium does not explain dynamic systems, but it does provide a contextual framework for describing certain aspects of organization. One object is &#x201C;above&#x201D; another if it has a higher potential energy measured against an externally defined equilibrium position &#x2013; the ground.</p>
<p>Chemical equilibrium is used as an explanatory concept in some areas of biochemistry, but in many applications it is limited to processes that occur on fast timescales relative to the presumably non-equilibrium changes occurring in the local cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>). However, there are cases where equilibrium of other types emerges at other levels of organization in living systems. The morphology (form) of organisms is subject to a physical balance of forces, whether they are transmitted directly, or indirectly through heredity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gould, 1971</xref>). For example, physical constraints shape the form of bones; in this and other examples, &#x201C;equilibrium figures are common in organic nature&#x201D; as protection from environmental stresses (G. Evelyn Hutchinson, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gould, 1971</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gould (1980)</xref> used &#x201C;structural integration&#x201D; to refer to limitations on designs of functional features imposed by physical, architectural constraints.</p>
<p>The concept of allostery in molecular biology holds that the enzymatic properties of a protein, or the strength of binding of a protein factor to DNA, are sensitive to changes in conformation or electronic structure of the protein that can result from &#x201C;gratuitous&#x201D; interactions of completely different molecules at different sites on the protein. This disconnect between regulator and substrate has given to molecular biology a guiding principle for signaling and control that is ostensibly free from chemical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Judson, 1979</xref>, ch. 10). In contrast, the position taken in this study is that chemical equilibrium, and chemical forces (reaction potential or affinity) have descriptive and explanatory roles in biological systems at higher levels than the mechanism of molecular interactions. This study, which is focused on a higher level of system description, is explicitly <italic>not</italic> a model of molecular interactions. Instead, it will emerge that by utilizing thermodynamic concepts that deal with open systems it is possible to address the effects of subcellular microenvironments on patterns of protein expression important to signaling and cellular differentiation.</p>
<p>There is a growing concern that the conventional mechanistic language of molecular biology is insufficient to account for higher-level developmental and systematic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kitcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bizzarri et al., 2013</xref>). Inherent in the multiple perspectives arising from looking at different levels of organization, the investigation of lower levels is concerned more with mechanisms, while a shift in focus to higher levels reveals context, or constraints, for interactions at lower levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pickett et al., 2007</xref>). Thermodynamics incorporates a high-level description that guides attention to chemical and environmental constraints. Such a high-level description does depend on abstract simplification, but this is distinct from a mechanistic reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Green and Wolkenhauer, 2013</xref>). Instead, the thermodynamic model presented here gives predictions about the relative tendencies of protein formation in an local environmental context. This may be found to offer a macro-perspective, complementary to bottom-up models of network interactions based on differential equations, that can help to manage the growing challenges of systems biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Drack and Wolkenhauer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Stability, in terms of equilibrium conditions or steady states<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></sup>, has had a fundamental conceptual role and explanatory relevance to developmental biology. In early embryological studies, cellular determination was seen as a progression through progressively more stable states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Needham, 1942</xref>). The different trajectories available to cells along locally stable states (&#x201C;canalization&#x201D;) describes the epigenetic landscape metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Waddington, 1956</xref>). These models of cellular determination and epigenesis underlie a theoretical definition of morphogenetic fields in the spatial domain of tissues: &#x201C;Instability (high potentiality) is continually giving place to stability (restricted potentiality)&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Needham, 1942</xref>, p. 130). However, a chemical manifestation of these theoretical relationships was elusive; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Waddington (1956)</xref> felt that biochemistry was not ready &#x201C;to provide the main framework of ideas for embryology&#x201D;. More recently, the epigenetic landscape metaphor and morphogenetic field concepts, though still without widely recognized chemical implications, are becoming utilized as useful strategies for system-level descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bizzarri et al., 2013</xref>) and the (re)union of evolutionary and developmental biology (evo-devo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gilbert et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1948, Sol Spiegelman made an important proposal that unique enzymatic patterns in differentiation arise from a sort of ecological competition for available substrates; as summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gilbert (1996)</xref>, &#x201C;The different enzymatic reactions compete for a limited amount of amino acids and energy.&#x201D; This and related concepts, such as Schoenheimer&#x2019;s &#x201C;dynamic equilibrium&#x201D; of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Judson, 1979</xref>), were soon overshadowed by a mechanistic emphasis on persistent, interactive parts that accompanied the rise of molecular biology in the 1950s: &#x201C;if it were not true that macromolecules, proteins, are stable, molecular biology would not be what it is&#x201D; (Monod, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Judson, 1979</xref>). Nevertheless, presently there is little doubt of the continual turnover of proteins, with degradation occurring through both lysosomal and ubiquitin-mediated processes (autophagy and proteolysis) with a wide range of timescales in bacterial and eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ciechanover, 2013</xref>). Still, there has been very little recent work on the material and energy requirements for macromolecular synthesis and degradation that were recognized by workers in the pre-molecular biology era. Because of recent advances in thermodynamic models and the growing availability of information on protein expression and cellular organization and dynamics, now is a fitting time to re-assess the possible utility of a thermodynamic framework for describing developmental patterns.</p>
<p>In the cellular patterning and differentiation in the development of the neural tube, major regulatory proteins (transcription factors) have spatial expression patterns, connected with a morphogenetic signaling gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jessell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). In most descriptions of the intracellular signaling networks, regulation of gene expression (transcription) is explained as a set of interactions between preexisting molecules, most commonly binding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to binding, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and other modifications (e.g. ubiquitination) are often considered. These different changes lead to the activation or inactivation of the molecules. The signal transduction cascade ultimately leads to the binding of specific proteins (transcription factors) to the DNA, causing changes in gene expression. The analogy of a &#x201C;relay&#x201D; was introduced to describe the mediating influence of allosteric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Judson, 1979</xref>) and has been also invoked in more recent descriptions of signaling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>). I refer to models built within this conceptual framework as &#x201C;relay models&#x201D;.</p>
<p>While the downstream effects of interactions in the relay models of signal transduction are at the level of the gene (transcription), the steps involved in upstream signal transduction are likely to depend on dynamics of protein synthesis and degradation. The model below takes as its primary focus the forces driving formation and degradation of different proteins, and has the potential to reveal controls on signaling networks, including responses from external stimuli, that act at the level of proteins. I label this description based on the overall requirements of protein degradation and translation as &#x201C;chemical integration&#x201D;.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the thermodynamic model itself is oblivious to mechanism; the multiple steps of protein synthesis and degradation are simply not present in the model. However, biological knowledge in the form of proteins that are sequentially induced in tissues or that may be closely localized and reacting in cells form the basis for specifying the starting constraints to build the model. These &#x201C;top-down&#x201D; constraints are built into the model as assumptions of local equilibrium among a restricted set of candidate proteins (metastable equilibrium). The thermodynamic calculations give as output a theoretical prediction of the relative stabilities of the proteins that has an explicit dependence on subcellular microenvironmental conditions. The rankings of the relative stabilities of the proteins show which proteins are most likely to form.</p>
<p>In the Methods, a brief survey covers applications of chemical thermodynamics in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. In the Results, the model is presented as a thermodynamic framework for describing the observed developmental patterns; the model is based on assumptions about the set of proteins that can chemically react, but it otherwise is not dependent on mechanism. In the Discussion, some speculations are offered on the possible relationships between the thermodynamic calculations and both lower-level molecular mechanisms and higher-level cellular organization. In particular, I suggest that by coupling degradation of endocytosed signaling and receptor proteins with localized translation, the thermodynamic constrains provide a source of specificity that operates in combination with the molecular-level signal transduction and genetic interactions.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<p>By saying &#x201C;reaction&#x201D; or &#x201C;transformation&#x201D; is meant <italic>only</italic> the change in the abundances of proteins and composition of the system, not the detailed reaction pathway through which the transformation occurs. It is important to keep in mind that a major advantage of equilibrium calculations is not just to consider the final equilibrium state, but to be used as a framework for describing <italic>irreversible</italic> reactions; that is, &#x201C;equilibrium calculations define limiting conditions for real processes&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Helgeson et al., 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>First consider the concepts of <italic>thermodynamic components</italic>, giving a consistent framework for describing compositional differences, and <italic>standard states</italic> and <italic>chemical potentials</italic>, giving a theory for calculating energetic differences. Then, look at the <italic>affinity</italic>, or driving force for reactions that are out of equilibrium. Then summarize extra-thermodynamic considerations, including constraints that can be imposed to describe <italic>metastable</italic> equilibrium.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Thermodynamic components and reactions</title>
<p>The notion of components is an essential part of a chemical thermodynamic model. The <italic>components</italic> comprise the minimum number of chemical formula units that can be linearly combined to constitute any species (be it mineral, organic species, protein, etc.) in the system under study. Components do not exist in reality, but are defined only in models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>). Any particular choice of components is admissible as long as is it is one of the minimum number of independent compositional variables in the system (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Helgeson, 1970</xref>). The implication is that a choice of different sets of components will contain different variables, and a different numerical description of the system, that nevertheless is completely equivalent in terms of the thermodynamic relations. Accordingly, the actual identities of components is governed by convenience, and is independent of actual structure or &#x201C;internal constitution&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gibbs, 1875</xref>, p. 117).</p>
<p>The considerations for choosing components may include the ease of making diagrams and interpretations, for example by selecting variables permitting intuitive representations of oxidation state and solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Helgeson, 1970</xref>), and availability of thermodynamic data for actual species having the formulas of the components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thompson, 1959</xref>). Once the components are chosen, the coefficients in a reaction to form any species from the components are uniquely determined. This also means that, in general, these reactions are not representative of the mechanism of synthesis.</p>
<p>Where the major elements in the system are CHNOS, inorganic species such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S and O<sub>2</sub> can be used as components. If a charged species, for example H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is included, the set no longer constitutes thermodynamic components (since phases are electrically neutral), and are referred to as <italic>basis species</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>). Using basis species, it is possible to consider pH or Eh as independent variables. In this study neutral species are used.</p>
<p>Let us consider the overall formation reaction of a protein from components or basis species. This reaction represents the mass-balance requirements for formation of the human Sonic hedgehog protein (Shh) in a system described by the components identified above.
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>This reaction does not include ionization, phosphorylation, or complexation with metals, which would require other components or basis species. A reaction representing the overall formation of any other protein would involve the same set of components. Again, such a reaction contains no information about the mechanism of synthesis of the biomolecules. Instead, it is a specific statement of the law of conservation of mass. This reaction, or one that could be written for any other molecule or collection of molecules, is the starting point for quantifying the mass and energy requirements for transformations between molecules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Affinity and equilibrium</title>
<p>Given the overall formation reaction for any species (Reaction 1), and if the standard Gibbs energies of the species are available, it is possible to calculate the overall &#x201C;reaction potential&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Helgeson, 1979</xref>) or driving force for the reaction, a quantity known as the <italic>chemical affinity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Donder and Van Rysselberghe, 1936</xref>).</p>
<p>The affinity of a reaction (<italic>A<sub>r</sub></italic>) is defined as the differential of Gibbs energy of the system (&#x0394;<italic>G</italic>) with respect to reaction progress or extent (<italic>&#x03BE;<sub>r</sub></italic>), at constant temperature (<italic>T</italic>), pressure (<italic>P</italic>) and extent of other reactions (<italic>&#x03BE;<sub>k</sub></italic>) i.e. <italic>A<sub>r</sub></italic> &#x2261; &#x2212; (<italic>&#x2202;</italic>&#x0394;<italic>G</italic>/<italic>&#x2202;&#x03BE;<sub>r</sub></italic>)<sub><italic>P</italic>,<italic>T</italic>,<italic>&#x03BE;<sub>k</sub></italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Helgeson, 1979</xref>). The affinity is calculated using (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Helgeson, 1979</xref>)
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula> where <italic>R</italic> is the gas constant and <italic>K<sub>r</sub></italic> and <italic>Q<sub>r</sub></italic> are the equilibrium constant and the activity quotient of the reaction. <italic>Q<sub>r</sub></italic> is calculated using
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula> where <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> is the chemical activity of the <italic>i</italic>th species in the system, and <italic>V<sub>i,r</sub></italic> is the reaction coefficient of the <italic>i</italic>th species in the reaction (negative for reactants, positive for products). The chemical activity is defined according to
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula> where <italic>&#x03BC;<sub>i</sub></italic> is the chemical potential and <inline-formula>
<alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="015826_inline1.gif"/></alternatives>
</inline-formula> is the <italic>standard</italic> chemical potential (or standard Gibbs energy, &#x0394;<italic>G</italic>&#x00B0;) of the <italic>i</italic>th species. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eqs. (2)</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">(4)</xref> can be combined to give the familiar expression relating the standard Gibbs energy change of the reaction to the equilibrium constant, <inline-formula>
<alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="015826_inline2.gif"/></alternatives>
</inline-formula> ln <italic>K<sub>r</sub></italic>. In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref>, activity (<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>) is replaced by fugacity (<italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>) for gaseous species, including O<sub>2</sub> used in the examples below. In an ideal system, activity can be equated with concentration, so activities (and fugacity for O<sub>2</sub>) are the independent variables used in the calculations here.</p>
<p>The affinity calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> is numerically the opposite of the overall Gibbs energy of reaction (&#x0394;<italic>G<sub>r</sub></italic>; not the standard Gibbs energy, <inline-formula>
<alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="015826_inline3.gif"/></alternatives>
</inline-formula>). From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> it follows that the affinity is positive if <italic>Q</italic> &#x003C; <italic>K</italic>, negative if <italic>Q</italic> &#x003E; <italic>K</italic>, and zero if <italic>Q</italic> &#x003D; <italic>K</italic>. While <italic>A<sub>r</sub></italic> is the affinity for a single formation reaction, the calculation of affinities also gives the condition for equilibrium in a system<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> where the species chemically interconvert (transform). If <italic>A<sub>r</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0 for all of the reactions in a system, the system is in <italic>stable</italic> equilibrium; if <italic>A<sub>r</sub></italic> is equal, but non-zero for all of the reactions, the system is in <italic>metastable</italic> equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Donder and Van Rysselberghe, 1936</xref>).</p>
<p>The affinity depends on the environment, both through the effects of temperature and pressure on the standard Gibbs energies (affecting <italic>K</italic>), and through the activities of the basis species in the reaction (affecting <italic>Q</italic>). Changes in the latter may occur via reactions internal to the system or may be buffered by the environment. A thermodynamic potential function that is minimized in a system open to one or more components is derived by a Legendre transform of the differential for Gibbs energy, which is used to change the natural variable from moles of components to chemical potentials of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alberty, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>). This is the basis for the theory of &#x201C;perfectly mobile components&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thompson, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Korzhinskii, 1965</xref>), giving a method for describing the dependence of equilibrium states of <italic>open systems</italic> on chemical changes in the environment.</p>
<p>It is instructive to compute affinities for a number of different species (e.g. proteins) given a set of common environmental conditions and protein activities. Comparing the affinities of the different proteins, the most stable one has the reaction with the highest affinity. Because affinity scales with the size of the molecules, in performing such a stability comparison it is usually desirable to divide all reactions and affinities by the number of amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dick, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>By varying one or more of <italic>T</italic>, <italic>P</italic> or the chemical activities of the basis species, it is possible to investigate the dependence of the relative stabilities of the proteins on these parameters. These relations are conveniently shown on a <italic>predominance diagram</italic>, which shows the most stable species (the one that would be predominant at equilibrium, i.e. have the highest mole fraction) in the system as a function of two variables (on the <italic>x</italic> and y axes). If both of these variables are activities (or fugacities) of the basis species (an <italic>activity diagram</italic>), then the relative positions of the predominance fields and the slopes of the boundaries between them are set by the compositions of the proteins (specifically, the slopes are given by the negative reciprocals of the ratios of the reaction coefficients; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Helgeson, 1967</xref>). The absolute positions of the boundary lines, however, are set by the standard Gibbs energies of the reactions and the activities of the basis species that are not variable on the diagram.</p>
<p>In the calculations described below, two variables are considered: fugacity of O<sub>2</sub> and activity of H<sub>2</sub>O. These are chemical potentials in the calculation, and are not constrained in any way other than to explore the effects of their changes on the relative stabilities of the proteins. The numerical values of log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> should not be taken to represent actual values (partial pressure or humidity), but rather are <italic>indicators</italic> of the state of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>), that reflect the composition of the system, or the buffering of the chemical potentials by other assemblages of species. The challenge of attaching meaning to very low, unmeasurable values of oxygen fugacity has long been acknowledged by geochemists. A striking demonstration is the calculation showing that an oxygen fugacity equal to 10<sup>&#x2212;65</sup> corresponds to one molecule of O<sub>2</sub> in a volume the size of the solar system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>). The remark made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Helgeson et al. (1993)</xref> is relevant here: &#x201C;It should perhaps be emphasized in the context of reactions among organic species that <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub><sub>(g)</sub></sub> does not necessarily refer to free oxygen and that use of log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub><sub>(g)</sub></sub> to describe equilibrium relations among these and other species does not require a gas phase to actually be present in the system.&#x201D; Likewise, <italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> should be interpreted not as the actual &#x201C;water activity&#x201D; but, like <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, as an indicator of the state of the system.</p>
<p>The interpretations from this analysis are often limited to variation in one or two chemical potentials as represented by the diagrams, but in cells there are doubtless many simultaneous changes. The projection on to two dimensions on predominance diagrams, however, helps to formulate hypotheses about the operational range of parameters in the system. Then, it is useful to plot the affinities, or equilibrium distributions, of all of the species along a provisional trend in parameters in order to view the relations of the less stable proteins.</p>

<title>Metastable and local equilibrium</title>
<p>If some reactions proceed too slowly to reach a stable state a metastable equilibrium among the other species can result. Metastable equilibrium can be considered as a type of partial or constrained equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2014</xref>) and can be modeled by only allowing certain species to react. Metastable equilibrium also has an energetic definition, as coexistence of species with equal, but non-zero affinities of formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Donder and Van Rysselberghe, 1936</xref>), so the energy of system is not a global minimum. Metastable equilibrium has been recognized as an important feature of organic molecules in geochemical systems. One example is the apparent metastable equilibrium among organic acids, some hydrocarbons, minerals, and CO<sub>2</sub> in hydrocarbon reservoirs, explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Helgeson et al. (1993)</xref>, who also noted that &#x201C;mere recognition of a given equilibrium state carries no necessary causal implication with respect to mass transfer processes that may have led to the state&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The focus above was on global equilibrium states, but the thermodynamic principles can be extended to irreversible systems with the adoption of the <italic>local equilibrium</italic> hypothesis. In a system that is not at equilibrium, the hypothesis maintains that in a small enough volume (&#x201C;locally&#x201D;), the entropy and other state variables can be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson, 2005</xref>). Under this assumption, thermodynamic state variables, which are defined only for chemical equilibrium, can be used to describe and quantify the states and conditions of local systems within a larger non-equilibrium system. For example, local equilibrium in the context of irreversible reactions is the basis for thermodynamic models of metasomatic zonation occurring through transport processes involving introduction or removal of material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thompson, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Helgeson, 1979</xref>), and is also a basic assumption in non-equilibrium theory of entropy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Prigogine and Nicolis, 1971</xref>). Here the conjecture made is that local and metastable equilibrium can be applied to subcellular and multicellular systems containing macromolecules (proteins).</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The development of the neural tube in animal embryos involves complex interactions between morphogens (proteins and other molecules that relay a concentration-dependent signal of positional information), transcription factors (intracellular DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression), and other molecules. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al. (2008)</xref> give an invigorating review of the major features of dorsal-ventral patterning, in which the protein called Sonic hedgehog (Shh) acts as a graded morphogen. To summarize the situation very briefly, Shh is synthesized in cells located at the notochord and floor plate (FP) at the ventral side of the neural tube, and its diffusion and reactions through the tissue results in concentration gradients. Various intracellular transcription factors (TFs) are induced depending on the concentration and timing of exposure of cells to Shh. The specific TFs are responsible for differences in gene expression and the formation of different cell types (neural progenitors) that give rise to e.g. motor and sensory neurons. This complex system has been the subject of studies that consider the physical constraints on diffusion, cross-dependence of activation and inhibition, and computational simulation at the level of gene regulatory networks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lander, 2007</xref> for a conceptual review and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen et al., 2014</xref> for a recent model of transcriptional regulation). Inherent in the existing models is that morphogens are subject to degradation reactions, as they diffuse or otherwise are transported from the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lander, 2007</xref>).

<title>Metastable equilibrium model for Shh as an intercellular morphogen</title>
<p>For the calculations, human protein sequences were taken from the UniProt database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">The UniProt Consortium, 2015</xref>). The sequence for Shh is that of the 174-residue N-terminal product that is part of the active morphogen. The post-translational modifications by cholesterol addition at the C terminus and palmitoylation at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>) are not included here. These modifications are likely to have a significant impact on the stability relations, but thermodynamic data for the lipid groups are not yet available and should be considered in future studies. Basis species used are as shown in Reaction 1, with constant activities given by log<italic>a</italic><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> &#x003D; &#x2212;3, log<italic>a</italic><sub>NH<sub>3</sub></sub> &#x003D; &#x2212;7, log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>S</sub> &#x003D; &#x2212;7 (using base 10 logarithms); log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> are used as exploratory variables. Because no generally applicable mixing model is available, activity coefficients of proteins are taken to be unity; therefore activities are provisionally equated to concentrations, in molal units (mol kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The energies of reactions are divided by length (number of amino acid residues) of the proteins; so the lines in the metastable predominance diagram in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> represent equal activities of the residue equivalents of the proteins.

<p>The first set of calculations includes the morphogen (Shh) and the most ventral transcription factors. Of these, Olig2 is first formed ventrally, at the FP; with time Nkx2.2, then Foxa2 replaces the ventral expression of Olig2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>). Toward more dorsal domains, the expression of Pax6 is increased, giving the progression Nkx2.2-Olig2-Pax6 for the p3, pMN, and p2 progenitors, with a low expression of Pax6 in pMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> is a metastable equilibrium predominance diagram showing the results of the thermodynamic calculations. Shh occupies the more reducing (low-log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) side of the diagram, while Olig2 is at the opposite end, and the other TFs are in the middle. Accordingly, Olig2 can be most easily formed in oxidizing conditions. Under these conditions, Shh is unstable and has the potential to react. In the second diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), more proteins are added: Nkx6.1, Dbx2 and Pax7. These proteins are active in more dorsal zones of the neural tube (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>). Pax7 does not appear in the diagram; it is energetically less stable than the others. Nkx6.1 and Dbx2 have replaced (covered up) the stability fields of two of the earlier TFs (Foxa2 and Nkx2.2). The diagram shows that if Nkx6.1 is present, Shh is unstable and has the potential to react. The addition of the last set of TFs (Irx3, Nkx6.2, Dbx1 and Pax6) considered in this model is shown in the third diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Once again, these new TFs are calculated to be more stable, and their stability fields cover up those of the previous proteins, except for Shh and Olig2.</p>
<p>The diagrams can be used to predict changes in the relative stabilities of TFs resulting from reaction with Shh manifested as changes in the log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> values of the microenvironment. For example, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, reaction of Shh (that is, its irreversible degradation), would bring the system to a more reduced state, leading to a stabilization of Nkx2.2 over Olig2. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, reaction of Shh favors formation of Dbx2 over Nkx6.1. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, reaction of Shh destabilizes Irx3, promoting formation first of Nkx6.2, then Dbx1. The directions of the theoretically predicted reactions noted here for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b and c</xref> are in the <italic>same</italic> order as the observed ventral-dorsal progression (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but in <italic>reversed</italic> order for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. The significance of these trends is explored in more detail below.</p>

<title>Intercellular model: energetic interpretation</title>
<p>The diagrams in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> show only the metastably predominant protein, that is, the one with the highest affinity per residue under specified conditions. A provisional linear relationship between log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is shown by the dashed line in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. By postulating an environmental trajectory that can be projected onto one dimension it becomes possible to graphically compare the affinities of all the molecules rather than show an identification of only the most stable one.</p>
<p>The affinities of formation of proteins are strongly inversely related to oxidation state of the system (e.g. Fig. 6b of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dick, 2014</xref>). To visualize the differences between proteins, the affinities in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> are plotted as differences from the values calculated for Shh. Therefore, Shh appears as a horizontal line at zero; lines above and below this line correspond to proteins that are more or less stable, respectively, relative to Shh, in the given conditions. Notably, the lines for the TFs all have negative slopes, so that Shh becomes the most stable protein in sufficiently reducing conditions. As log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> are increased, the TFs become more stable than Shh in a definite order. Olig2, with the most negative slope, becomes the most stable protein in very oxidizing conditions.</p>
<p>The same affinities are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, but with legends added to suggest a thermodynamic description of the distribution of Shh and transcription factors during dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural tube. Among the series of TFs predicted to become relatively stable can be found the sequence Nkx2.2, Olig2, and Pax6 (colored lines intersecting the Shh line at the bottom of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These TFs are required for differentiation of the p3, pMN and p2 domains, in this order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Suppose that Shh is introduced from the notochord into an environment that is initially at high log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>, far from the conditions where Shh is relatively stable. A thermodynamic interpretation based on the calculations shown above is that the reaction of Shh (i.e. its degradation and the subsequent alteration of the chemical composition of the local microenvironment) drives down the values of log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>; more so near the source, where more Shh is available. The lowest values of log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> are permissive for formation of Nkx2.2 but not Olig2 or Pax6. Increasing log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>, that is, a decreasing influence of Shh, is favorable for formation of Olig2, then Pax6 in a stepwise fashion.</p>
<p>The thermodynamic story is, however, more complicated than this. At the conditions where Nkx2.2, Olig2 and Pax6 first become stable relative to Shh, other TFs are even more stable (higher lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, the formation of Nkx2.2, Olig2 and Pax6 represent irreversible reactions moving <italic>toward</italic> an equilibrium state, but not arrival at the metastable equilibrium state, which would comprise an assemblage of proteins, with the most abundant being the one with the lowest energy (highest affinity). The appearance of Nkx2.2, Olig2 and Pax6 in the thermodynamic framework can therefore be conceived as a <italic>loading</italic> stage of Shh-driven differentiation, as portrayed in the bottom part of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The correspondence between the protein stability calculations so far described and the neural progenitor types can be summarized as
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>In the differentiation from pMN to p2, both Pax6 and Irx3 but not Olig2 are found in p2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). Moving away from the high-log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> limit of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Irx3 replaces Olig2 as the most stable proteins in the system. This pattern can be conceived as the product of irreversible apparent chemical reaction toward the most stable products in the system. Therefore, this reaction can be identified theoretically as the first step in an <italic>unloading</italic> stage, as portrayed in the upper part of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. With further addition of Shh into the system, not only do its effects span a greater distance, but the system has more time to react, and to relax in response to the initial loading and formation of a non-equilibrium state.</p>
<p>With these theoretical considerations in mind, the calculated energies shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> can be used to describe the rest of the major reactions. As noted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jessell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>), the transition from p2 to p1 is accompanied by the loss of Nkx6.1 and the appearance of Dbx2. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, decreasing log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> favors formation of Dbx2 relative to Nkx6.1. The appearance of Nkx6.2 after Irx3 is also characteristic of differentiation of p1 from p2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); this reaction can be located as well in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, at somewhat greater log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> values than the Nkx6.1 - Dbx2 reaction. Finally, at considerably lower values of log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows the reaction Nkx6.2 - Dbx1, corresponding to the transition from p1 to p0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dessaud et al., 2008</xref>). In summary, the correspondence between the calculated relative stabilities of the proteins in the unloading stage of the model and the observed neural differentiation patterns can be represented as
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula> (Here, the staggered positions of the reactions represent the conditions at which the calculated stability transition occurs: lower log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> to the right.)</p>
<p>The energetic analysis suggests a final, third stage, corresponding to conditions of maximal relative stability of Shh compared to the TFs (far right of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The overall greater stability of Shh compared to any TF at low log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> implies that Shh may reach metastable saturation in the tissue. Both the sequence of irreversible reactions leading to this point, and the loss of reaction potential at saturation, are thermodynamic constraints that may operate in conjunction with mechanistically based signaling processes in the developing embryo.</p>

<title>Intracellular model: Interaction of Shh with cell-surface receptors and signaling of transcriptional activators</title>
<p>The expression of the transcription factors in different cells (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is brought about through a series of signals involving cell-surface receptors and intracellular transcriptional activators. The following paragraph is a very abridged description of the detailed signaling mechanism outlined in review papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>), some aspects of which are explored further in the Discussion.</p>
<p>The intercellular morphogen Shh is a ligand that binds to the membrane receptor Patched (Ptch1). Upon binding, the Shh-Ptch1 complex is brought into the cell interior through endocytosis. The Shh-Ptch complex can be transported to recycling endosomes, from which Ptch1 is returned to the membrane, or transferred to lysosomes, where the proteins are degraded. When at the membrane, Ptch1 is a repressor of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). The removal of Ptch1 from the membrane leads to activation of Smo. Activated Smo transmits a signal to the DNA-binding Gli proteins (Gli1, Gli2, Gli3). Differential signaling events promote phosphorylation of Gli proteins, leading to their proteolysis and the formation of truncated sequences. The full-length forms are transcriptional activators (GliA), and the truncated forms are repressors (GliR). All of the Gli proteins can serve as activators, but the most important functions are activation by full-length Gli2 (Gli2A) and repression by truncated Gli3 (Gli3R). Ultimately, DNA binding by Gli modulates the expression of the downstream TFs, which in their turn bind DNA to activate the development-specific genes that determine the cellular identity.</p>
<p>The currently unknown mechanisms for repression of Smo by Ptch, activation of Gli by Smo, and control of downstream transcriptional events by GliR and GliA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>) constitute major gaps in the &#x201C;relay model&#x201D; for intracellular signal transduction summarized above. If we hypothesize that the downstream transcription factors (TFs; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) are formed through localized translation that is materially dependent on the lysosomal degradation of Shh and Ptch, then the expression of the TFs would be subject to thermodynamic constraints that can be theoretically assessed as described below. These intersection of these non-mechanistic constraints with known signaling mechanisms may help to resolve the open questions about the overall operation of the signaling process.</p>
<p>The compositional and energetic relations for the major interacting intracellular proteins are portrayed in the stability diagrams in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The methods are similar to the previous set of calculations, except that the reaction coefficients used in making <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> are normalized by protein length, so that the lines indicate equal activities of the proteins, not the residues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dick and Shock, 2011</xref>). The importance of normalization can be seen in the effects it has on the appearance of stability fields of proteins of different length. If the reactions in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a-c</xref> were normalized (they were not), the size of the Shh field would grow; Shh is the shortest protein in that system. The most noticeable change there would be the shift of the Shh-Dbx1 boundary closer to log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> &#x003D; 0. In contrast, if the reactions in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4a-c</xref> (see below) were <italic>not</italic> normalized, the stability field for Gli3R, the shortest protein in that system, would not appear anywhere in the range of conditions shown on the diagram. Gli3R is derived from, and is much shorter than the activator form; it is thought that the relative abundances of Gli3R and Gli3A have a major control on the transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>). Therefore, normalization is a desirable strategy as it enables theoretical prediction of the conditions where the proteins are equally abundant in metastable equilibrium (the field boundaries in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

<p>In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> the stability field for Smo appears between Shh and Ptch1; that is, a combination of the latter two proteins is unstable with respect to Smo. Also, Shh is stabilized at relatively oxidizing conditions. This is consistent with a comparatively lower average oxidation state of carbon in Smo and Ptch1, a common trend for membrane-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dick, 2014</xref>).

The stability fields of Gli2A, and to a lesser extent Gli3R (at the lower end of the range of log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> shown), replace the Shh field. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, the downstream transcription factors are added (same as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a-c</xref>). The fields for Gli2A and, to some extent, Gli3R are covered by those of the transcription factors; showing that the latter are more stable than the former. The log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>-log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> values corresponding to different ratios of chemical activities (concentrations) of Gli2A/Gli3R are overlaid in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> to suggest possible downstream control by redox buffering (see below).</p>
<p>These chemical thermodynamic relationships have some conceptual implications that can be compared with observations in cell biology. <italic>In the model</italic>, the greater stability of Smo compared to Shh&#x002B;Ptch1 in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> is compatible with the notion that degradation of Shh&#x002B;Ptch1 could lead to increased formation of Smo. <italic>In the cell</italic>, Shh binding to Ptch1 is followed by endocytosis of the Shh&#x002B;Ptch1 complex and targeting to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>). Shh binding also removes the inhibition by Ptch on Smo that promotes the turnover of Smo and prevents its accumulation at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>). <italic>In the model</italic>, Gli2A and Gli3R are together more stable than Shh. Therefore, addition of Shh to the system increases the potential for formation of Gli2A and Gli3R, and a greater proportion of Shh relative to more reduced proteins (such as the receptor Ptch) would lead to a greater potential for formation of Gli2A relative to Gli3R. <italic>In the cell</italic>, activation of Shh signaling leads to formation of Gli2A and a decrease in the half-life of Gli3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>). <italic>In the model</italic>, the relatively low slope of the Gli2A-Gli3R reaction boundary reflects a low sensitivity to changing log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> and correspondingly strong connection to changes in oxidation state. If it is supposed that Gli2A/Gli3R concentrations are sufficient to act as a redox buffer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), it gives differences in the relative potential for formation of the different transcription factors, through which a selective force may be imparted on protein translation. <italic>In the cell</italic>, the actual mechanism of transmitting the signal from Gli to downstream gene products is unknown, but it is thought to have an essential dependence on the Gli concentrations and GliA/GliR ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparing the intercellular and intracellular models</title>
<p>Note the occurrence of stepwise patterns in the metastability relations of proteins in both the intracellular and intercellular models. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4a-c</xref> show, in order of increasing stability,

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn7.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The overall cellular protein expression patterns during signal transduction (see above) corroborate this result. This ordering is not a contrived result based on an arbitrary ordering of system definitions but necessarily follows from the relative energies of the proteins, as was shown for the transcription factors in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p>
<p>A progressive transition between energy levels is also apparent in the intercellular model. Consider the point in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> where Olig2 becomes more stable than Nkx2.2. As a simplification of the loading-unloading model described above, if the system is allowed to progress toward metastable equilibrium under constant log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and log<italic>a</italic><sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>, the next most stable proteins would be Dbx1, Nkx6.1, Irx3, and Nkx6.2, in that order. Under additional assumptions, this stability ranking gives
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="015826_eqn8.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula> which closely follows the pMN to p2 to p1 progression (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The additional assumptions needed for this result, i.e. that Dbx1 and Irx3 are meta-metastable, are useful findings in themselves, as they may guide the formation of hypotheses about additional, extra-thermodynamic sources of specificity that could arise from lower-level signaling mechanisms.</p>
<p>In both of the immediately preceding examples, as the system is approaching metastable equilibrium, it does not immediately go to the lowest-energy state, but instead steps through the energy levels. This is reminiscent of the the Ostwald step rule, known mostly in the context of mineral precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Morse and Casey, 1988</xref>). In some systems, it is not the most stable mineral that precipitates first, but a less stable one that is closer in energy to the nucleation event. The sequential progression of a system through close-to-equilibrium steps can result in lower entropy production than a reaction that immediately forms the most stable species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">van Santen, 1984</xref>). Thus, the apparent stepwise energetic relations might constitute evidence for processes that operate in accordance with the minimum entropy production principles for near-equilibrium systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Prigogine and Nicolis, 1971</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Some of the most pressing questions in developmental biology focus on the difference between descriptive and explanatory accounts, and the levels of organization at which explanation is relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Minelli and Pradeu, 2014</xref>). The model presented above, not being mechanistic in nature, is conceived as a high-level descriptive account, with an emphasis on the recognition of overall patterns. Compared to conventional representations of signaling through molecular interactions, binding and gene activation (&#x201C;relay models&#x201D;), this approach uses different state variables and looks at a different &#x201C;phase space&#x201D; for the system. The model provides for the construction of specific, quantitative descriptions based on assumed organizational constraints; therefore the present model provides a framework (or perhaps &#x201C;reference scheme&#x201D;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gould, 1980</xref>) for describing the system.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing efforts to elucidate the mechanistic steps of signaling interactions, there are many unclear connections and significant questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>). By what mechanisms does Ptch repress the activity of Smo? How are Shh concentrations passed through the intracellular signaling apparatus (&#x201C;interpreted&#x201D;)? How are &#x201C;combinations of Ci/Gli activators and repressors within a given cell &#x2026; utilized to produce a specific transcriptional response&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>)?</p>
<p>The signaling starting with Shh, through activation of Smo and Gli, is thought to result in transcriptional response that leads to the synthesis of the downstream transcription factors (Pax6, Olig2, etc.). However, there may be relevant control processes beyond the transcriptional stage. The processes of mRNA transport and localized translation have emerged as a nexus for response to external stimuli in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). Many different mechanisms of translation initiation have been identified, but as with the uncertainty about specificity of transcriptional signaling, many questions still remain about translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jung et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the properties of network interactions, including feedback, the behavior of a system also depends on restraints, i.e. the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Noble, 2010</xref>). Accounting for the integration of signaling systems with the spatial organization of the cell, including subcellular microenvironments, may require recognition of forces acting at higher levels, which might not be revealed through dissection and analysis of mechanisms. The thermodynamic model provides such a high-level description: starting with biologically informed assumptions about the sets of locally interacting proteins, the calculations proceed from mass balance and energetic considerations to give predictions &#x2013; in fact, statements of probability &#x2013; about the formation and degradation of proteins. The model carries no specific mechanistic dependencies, but can be formulated in terms of chemical potentials that characterize possible local equilibrium states of subcellular microenvironments.</p>
<p>In many pictures of endocytic pathways that contribute to intracellular signaling, the passage of endocytosed material to the lysosome (i.e. heterolysosome, as it contains exogenous material; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Duve and Wattiaux, 1966</xref>) is shown as a dead end. Lysosomal degradation is often regarded as the termination of the signal, but the degradation products certainly do not simply vanish. The degradation products of lysosomes are amino acids and other small molecules that go back into production of biomacromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Levine, 2007</xref>). There is currently little experimental evidence for a direct material link between the endocytic pathway and protein synthesis. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blower (2013)</xref> raised the possibility that &#x201C;mRNAs linked to endosomes could couple activation of a cell surface receptor to a translational response&#x201D;. Apart from endosomal activity, a correlation between location of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and translation has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pines and Lindon, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These bits of evidence from cellular studies combined with the requirements of mass balance can be used to suggest the hypothesis that the degradation products of endocytosed ligand-receptor complexes contribute to the localized synthesis of other signaling proteins (such as Gli) or the downstream transcription factors. A corollary of this hypothesis is that thermodynamic constraints will be evident in the reaction products &#x2013; the newly translated proteins. The thermodynamic model presented here quantifies these constraints in an ideal case. Shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> is a sequence of cellular states representing the hypothesized formation of a cellular subsystem, which is a localized, partially closed environment that is fed by endocytosed proteins and in turn becomes the source of material for newly locally translated proteins.</p>

</fig>
<p>The diagram also shows the general context of the molecular relay model of signal transduction leading to gene regulation (e.g. the arrow leading from Smo to the nucleus in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Of course, the &#x201C;phenomena at the macroscopic level must be reconciled with interactions on the level of molecular interactions&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Drack and Wolkenhauer, 2011</xref>). The overlapping possibility spaces of the relay model and the thermodynamic model would provide a more specific outcome than either type of process alone. This combination of perspectives can perhaps illuminate some of the open questions about the operation of the signaling network. For example, if the question about &#x201C;specific transcriptional response&#x201D; to varying GliA/GliR concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and Chuang, 2010</xref>) is broadened to consider the possibility of localized degradation (of Gli) and translation, then the relative stabilities of the proteins suggests a role of macroscopic thermodynamic constraints in affecting the potential for formation of different transcription factors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>The physical balance of forces gives rise to constraints for operations within the whole organism, which Gould generalized as &#x201C;structural integration&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gould, 1980</xref>). These constraints of variation, as internal factors of evolution, are revealed in structure and development that follow the &#x201C;laws of form&#x201D; and the &#x201C;transformation of the possible&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gould, 1983</xref>, p. 144, p. 157). Thermodynamics is, after all, about limiting the possibilities. This leads to a new look at a fundamental question: Why do the proteins have the sequences they do? If we consider the chemical composition and energies of the proteins, the model described here showed plausible constraints on their limits of stability and order of formation. By analogy to Gould&#x2019;s notion of structural integration, the constraints associated with chemical composition and energetics may be regarded as &#x201C;chemical integration&#x201D; within the organism. Organismal features constrained by structural integration are highly conserved in evolution: &#x201C;Minor adaptations are multifarious, but major reorganizations are rare and strongly constrained by inherited structure&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gould, 1980</xref>). The same may hold as well for developmental systems that depend on chemical integration of biomacromolecules. Thus, a high degree of chemical integration would tend to promote evolutionary conservation, and might contribute to the deep homology found between hedgehog morphogenetic systems in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gilbert et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The attributes of stability and equilibrium are closely associated with morphogenetic field concepts, of which morphogenetic gradients are a special case. Cellular determination starts with the condition of competence, which is a state of unstable equilibrium with multiple possible outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Needham, 1942</xref>). The effect of an &#x201C;organizer&#x201D; is to provide a stimulus by which responding, competent cells irreversibly undergo determination. The specificity inherent in progression through differing degrees of stability is crucial; depending on the direction in which an unstable equilibrium is moved by the organizer, different outcomes will be selected, leading precisely to a differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rosen, 1968</xref>). A succession of organizational actions gives rise to the developmental or epigenetic landscape metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Needham, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rosen, 1968</xref>). From these principles, a morphogenetic field can be defined that is a set of unstable entities (undifferentiated cells) in a spatial arrangement.</p>
<p>Needham&#x2019;s &#x201C;unstable equilibrium&#x201D; (or, generally, an unstable steady state; see footnote 1) can be identified in our terms as a local equilibrium that is less stable than the metastable equilibrium &#x2013; that is, any line below the locally highest line in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Take for example Shh: at highest log <italic>f</italic><sub>O2</sub> it is very unstable; as a chemical substance it has high potential to react. Depending on the direction and magnitude of change, the most stable protein will be Olig2, Irx3, Nkx6.2, Dbx2, or Shh - from highest to lowest log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>. The differential expression of these specific outcomes in terms of instability provides theoretical support for Shh to have &#x201C;organizer&#x201D; capabilities that, perhaps just as importantly, can be turned off when they are no longer needed (low log <italic>f</italic><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>).</p>
<p>The study of redox dynamics may give further insight into signaling pathways. Whole-embryo redox potentials in zebrafish reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Timme-Laragy et al. (2013)</xref> decrease steadily in the first &#x223C;20 hours post fertilization, then fluctuate prior to hatching, rise during the hatching period (48-72 hpf), and achieve steady values in the early larva. A fall, then rise, in redox state is qualitatively consistent with the loading/unloading model depicted for the human proteins in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. It would be interesting to compare the model with redox measurements in developmental systems at cellular or subcellular resolution, which are not currently available. Also, the model presented here is a simplification and many informative departures from this idealized state are possible. For example, a chemically integrated signaling system that is thermodynamically open may be regarded as being subject to cross talk with other redox-dependent metabolic pathways. In this situation, transformation of the protein molecules can be theoretically linked to compartment-specific subcellular redox states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dick, 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>Here I have outlined a high-level thermodynamic description of signaling and developmental patterns. There are reductionist assumptions inherent in either the conventional &#x201C;relay models&#x201D; or the descriptions based on chemical integration given here. However, by comparing patterns observed within different conceptual frameworks, complex biological properties might be distinguished from those that are simply emergent: &#x201C;The whole is greater than the parts when these emergent properties cannot be explained solely by using properties that can be directly attributed to individuated parts&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gilbert and Sarkar, 2000</xref>). A crucial distinction that may lead to a greater understanding of the whole is the explicit environmental dependence of macroscopic chemical thermodynamic models that, through Legendre transforms, utilize chemical potentials in the description of open systems. A comparable environmental dependence is operationally unavailable in current molecular-level explanations of signal transduction.</p>
<p>Chemical equilibrium is a theoretical point of departure from which we can construct quantitative descriptions of patterns in the physical world. In many areas of geochemistry, thermodynamic models are most useful not because they characterize stable equilibrium, but because by incorporating the concepts of affinity and metastability they provide the framework for identifying and quantifying non-equilibrium processes. This point was made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anderson (2014)</xref>: &#x201C;Equilibrium thermodynamics cannot of course deal with irreversible reactions which disappear from thermodynamic state space &#x2026; But thermodynamics can simulate such reactions using the affinity and the extent of reaction variable.&#x201D; This has important practical benefits: &#x201C;The study of metamorphic rocks shows that equilibrium has a broader meaning which is essential not only to the interpretation of rock history but also to understanding how thermodynamics deals with irreversible processes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Perhaps greater attention to this broader meaning of equilibrium will give more insight into biological processes as well, particularly those developmental processes that are characterized by irreversible steps of differentiation. Chemical thermodynamic models provide a high-level framework for describing compositional and energetic patterns related to differentiation, and foster novel hypotheses about linkages between subcellular microenvironments and macromolecular degradation and synthesis.</p>

<p>A steady state is constancy in an open or dynamic system. Thermodynamic equilibrium is a condition of maximum entropy and minimum energy, that is, greater stability. Chemical thermodynamic equilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium in which the rates of forward and back reactions are equal (as a simple example for one reaction); therefore, chemical equilibrium is a special case of a steady state. Many authors use &#x201C;equilibrium&#x201D; when the more general notion of &#x201C;steady state&#x201D; is more appropriate; this and other ambiguities of terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keller, 2008</xref>) apply to some of the citations in the following paragraphs. Any discussion or representation of chemical equilibrium, such as in this study, necessarily implies reference to a steady-state, so the following historical notes remain relevant. For example, the &#x201C;dynamic equilibrium&#x201D; of Schoenheimer is used in the general sense of steady state, without specifying thermodynamic equilibrium. Any manifestation of chemical equilibrium of proteins would be compatible with Schoenheimer&#x2019;s dynamic equilibrium.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2">
<label>2</label>
<p>There are differing definitions of &#x201C;system&#x201D;; in theoretical terms it can be defined by the identities of the components and the bulk (elemental) composition, but in a more limited fashion as used here it is specified as well by the set of possible species, enforcing the metastable equilibrium assumptions. These theoretical systems are only approximate models for a real system.</p></fn>
