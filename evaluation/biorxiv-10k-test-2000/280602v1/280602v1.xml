<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Microbial communities that degrade lignocellulosic biomass are typified by high levels of species- and strain-level complexity as well as synergistic interactions between both cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic microorganisms. <italic>Coprothermobacter proteolyticus</italic> frequently dominates thermophilic, lignocellulose-degrading communities with wide geographical distribution, which is in contrast to reports that it ferments proteinaceous substrates and is incapable of polysaccharide hydrolysis. Here we deconvolute a highly efficient cellulose-degrading consortium (SEM1b) that is co-dominated by <italic>Clostridium (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum-</italic> and multiple heterogenic strains affiliated to <italic>C. proteolyticus.</italic> Metagenomic analysis of SEM1b recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for each constituent population, whilst in parallel two novel strains of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> were successfully isolated and sequenced. Annotation of all <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> genotypes (two strains and one MAG) revealed their genetic acquisition of various carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), presumably derived from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events involving <italic>C. thermocellum-</italic> or Thermotogae-affiliated populations that are historically co-located. HGT material included whole saccharolytic operons and dockerin-encoding enzymatic subunits that are synonymous with cellulosomes. Finally, temporal genome-resolved metatranscriptomic analysis of SEM1b revealed expression of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> CAZymes at different SEM1b life-stages as well as co-expression of CAZymes from multiple SEM1b populations, inferring deeper microbial interactions that are dedicated towards co-degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. We show that <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic>, a ubiquitous keystone population, consists of closely related strains that have adapted via HGT to degrade both oligo- and longer polysaccharides present in decaying plants and microbial cell walls, thus explaining its dominance in thermophilic anaerobic digesters on a global scale.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The anaerobic digestion of plant biomass profoundly shapes innumerable ecosystems, ranging from the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other mammals to those that drive industrial applications such as biofuel generation. Biogas reactors are one of the most commonly studied anaerobic systems, yet many keystone microbial populations and their metabolic processes are poorly understood due to a lack of cultured or genome sampled representatives. <italic>Coprothermobacter</italic> spp. are frequently observed in high abundance in thermophilic anaerobic systems, where they are believed to exert strong protease activity whilst generating hydrogen and acetate, key intermediate metabolites for biogas production (<xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">Tandishabo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Molecular techniques have shown that their levels range from 10 to 90&#x0025; of the total microbial community, irrespective of bioreactors being operated on lignocellulose- or protein-rich substrates (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Despite their promiscuous distribution, global abundance and key role in biogas production, only two species have been described: <italic>Coprothermobacter platensis</italic> (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Etchebehere <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) and <italic>Coprothermobacter proteolyticus</italic> (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Ollivier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>). These two species and their inherent phenotypes have formed the predictive basis for the majority of <italic>Coprothermobacter</italic>-dominated systems described to date. Recent studies have illustrated that <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> populations in anaerobic biogas reactors form cosmopolitan assemblages of closely related strains that are hitherto unresolved (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Hagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>Frequently in nature, microbial populations are composed of multiple strains with genetic heterogeneity (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Kashtan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">Schloissnig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Studies of strain-level populations have been predominately performed with the human microbiome and especially the gut microbiota (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Bron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Spanogiannopoulos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The reasons for strain diversification and their coexistence remain largely unknown (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Ellegaard and Engel 2016</xref>), however several mechanisms have been hypothesized, such as: micro-niche selection (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Kashtan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), host selection (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">McLoughlin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), cross-feed interactions (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">Zelezniak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and phage selection (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Valera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Studies of isolated strains have shown that isolates can differ in a multitude of ways, including virulence and drug resistance (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Gill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">Sharon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Solheim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), motility (<xref rid="c77" ref-type="bibr">Zunino <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) and nutrient utilization (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Siezen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Strain-level genomic variations typically consist of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as acquisition/loss of genomic elements such as genes, operons or plasmids via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Koskella and Vos 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Tettelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">Treangen and Rocha 2011</xref>). Variability in gene content caused by HGT is typically attributed to phage-related genes and other genes of unknown function (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Ochman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and can give rise to ecological adaptation, niche differentiation and eventually speciation (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Bendall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Biller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although differences in genomic features can be accurately characterized in isolated strains, it has been difficult to capture such information using culture-independent approaches such as metagenomics. Advances in bioinformatics have improved taxonomic profiling of microbial communities from phylum to species level but it remains difficult to profile similar strains from metagenomes and compare them with the same level of resolution obtained by comparison of isolate genomes (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Truong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Since closely-related strains can also differ in gene expression (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x00E1;lez-Torres <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), being able to distinguish the expression profiles of individual strains in a broader ecological context is elemental to understanding the influence they exert towards the overall community function.</p>
<p>In this study, a novel population of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> that included multiple closely related strains, was observed within a simplistic biogas-producing consortium enriched on cellulose (hereafter referred to as SEM1b). Using a combined metagenomic and culture-dependent approach, two strains and a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) affiliated to <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> were recovered and genetically compared to the only available type strain, <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> DSM 5265. Notable genomic differences included the acquisition of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which inferred that <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> has adapted to take advantage of lignocellulosic polysaccharides. We further examined the saccharolytic potential of our recovered <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> population in a broader community context, by examining genome-resolved temporal metatranscriptomic data generated from the SEM1b consortium. Collective analysis highlighted the time-specific polysaccharide-degrading activity that <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> exerts in a cellulolytic microbial community.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Origin of samples and generation of the SEM1b consortium</title>
<p>An inoculum (100&#x03BC;l) was collected from a lab-scale biogas reactor (Reactor TD) fed with manure and food waste and run at 55&#x00B0;C. The TD reactor originated itself from a thermophilic biogas plant (Frevar) fed with food waste and manure in Fredrikstad, Norway. Our research groups have previously studied the microbial communities in both the Frevar plant (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Hagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and the TD bioreactor (<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">Zamanzadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), which provided a detailed understanding of the original microbial community. The inoculum was transferred for serial dilution and enrichment to an anaerobic serum bottle incubated at 65&#x00B0;C and containing the rich ATCC medium 1943, with cellobiose substituted for 10g/L of cellulose in the form of BALI treated Norway spruce (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">R&#x00F8;dsrud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). After an initial growth cycle, an aliquot was removed and serially diluted to extinction. Briefly, a 100&#x03BC;l sample was transferred to a new bottle of anaerobic medium, mixed and 100&#x03BC;l was directly transferred again to a new one (six serial transfers in total). The consortium at maximum dilution that retained the cellulose-degrading capability (SEM1b) was retained for the present work, and aliquots were stored at &#x2013; 80&#x00B0;C with glycerol (15&#x0025; v/v). In parallel, continuous SEM1b cultures were maintained via regular transfers into fresh media (each generation incubated for &#x223C;2-3 days).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Metagenomic analysis</title>
<p>Two different samples (D1B and D2B) were taken from a continuous SEM1b culture and were used for shotgun metagenomic analysis. D2B was 15 generations older than D1B and was used to leverage improvements in metagenome assembly and binning. From 6ml of culture, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes and were kept frozen at -20&#x00B0;C until processing. Non-invasive DNA extraction methods were used to extract high molecular weight DNA as previously described (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Kunath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The DNA was quantified using a Qubit&#x2122; fluorimeter and the Quant-iT&#x2122; dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and the quality was assessed with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>
<p>16S rRNA gene analysis was performed on both D1B and D2B samples. The V3-V4 hyper-variable regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the 341F/805R primer set: 5&#x2019;-CCTACGGGNBGCASCAG-3&#x2019; / 5&#x2019;-GACTACNVGGGTATCTAATCC-3&#x2019; (<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The PCR was performed as previously described (<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">Zamanzadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and the sequencing library was prepared using Nextera XT Index kit according to Illumina&#x2019;s instructions for the MiSeq system (Illumina Inc.). MiSeq sequencing (2x300bp with paired-ends) was conducted using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3. The reads were quality filtered (Phred &#x2265; Q20) and USEARCH61 (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2010</xref>) was used for detection and removal of chimeric sequences. Resulting sequences were clustered at 97&#x0025; similarity into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and taxonomically annotated with the pick_closed_reference_otus.py script from the QIIME v1.8.0 toolkit (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Caporaso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) using the Greengenes database (gg_13_8). The resulting OTU table was corrected based on the predicted number of <italic>rrs</italic> operons for each taxon (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Stoddard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>D1B and D2B were also subjected to metagenomic shotgun sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq3000 platform (Illumina Inc) at the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC, Oslo, Norway). Samples were prepared with the TrueSeq DNA PCR-free preparation, and sequenced with paired-ends (2x125bp) on four lanes (two lanes per sample). Quality trimming of the raw reads was performed using cutadapt (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2011</xref>), removing all bases on the 3&#x2019; end with a Phred score lower than 20 (if any present) and excluding all reads shorter than 100nt, followed by a quality filtering using the FASTX-Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>). Reads with a minimum Phred score of 30 over 90&#x0025; of the read length were retained. In addition, genomes from two isolated <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains (see below) were used to decrease the data complexity and to improve the metagenomic assembly and binning. The quality-filtered metagenomic reads were mapped against the assembled strains using the BWA-MEM algorithm requiring 100&#x0025; identity (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Li 2013</xref>). Reads that mapped the strains were removed from the metagenomic data and the remaining reads were co-assembled using MetaSpades v3.10.0 (N<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">urk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) with default parameters and k-mer sizes of 21, 33, 55 and 77. The subsequent contigs were binned with Metabat v0.26.3 (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) in &#x201C;very sensitive mode&#x201D;, using the coverage information from D1B and D2B. The quality (completeness, contamination and strain heterogeneity) of the bins (hereafter referred to as MAGs) was assessed by CheckM v1.0.7 (<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Parks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) with default parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Isolation of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains</title>
<p>Strains were isolated using the Hungate method (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Hungate 1969</xref>). In brief: Hungate tubes were anaerobically prepared with the DSMZ medium 481 with and without agar (15g/L). Directly after being autoclaved, Hungate tubes containing agar were cooled down to 65&#x00B0;C and sodium sulfide nonahydrate was added. From the SEM1b culture used for D1B, 100&#x03BC;l were transferred to a new tube and mixed. From this new tube, 100&#x03BC;l was directly transferred to fresh medium, mixed and transferred again (six transfers in total). Tubes were then cooled to 60&#x00B0;C for the agar to solidify, and then kept at the same temperature. After growth, single colonies were picked and transferred to liquid medium.</p>
<p>DNA was extracted using the aforementioned method for metagenomic DNA, with one amendment: extracted DNA was subsequently purified with DNeasy PowerClean Pro Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, USA) following manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. To insure the purity of the <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> colonies, visual confirmation was performed using light microscopy and long 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the primers pair 27F/1492R (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Schumann 1991</xref>): 5&#x2019;-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3&#x2019; / 5&#x2019;-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3&#x2019; and sequenced using Sanger technology. The PCR consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94&#x00B0;C for 5 min and 30 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x00B0;C for 1 min, annealing at 55&#x00B0;C for 1 min, and extension at 72&#x00B0;C for 1 min, and a final elongation at 72&#x00B0;C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and sent to GATC Biotech for Sanger sequencing.</p>
<p>The genomes of two isolated <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains (hereafter referred to as <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic>) were sequenced at the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC, Oslo, Norway). Samples were prepared with the TrueSeq DNA PCR-free preparation and sequenced using paired-ends (2x300bp) on a MiSeq system (Illumina Inc). Quality trimming, filtering and assembly were performed as described in the aforementioned metagenomic assembly section. All contigs from the strains and the Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were submitted to the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) system (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) for genomic feature prediction and annotation (pipeline version 4.15.1). Resulting annotated open reading frames (ORFs) were retrieved, further annotated for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) using dbCAN HMMs v5.0 (<xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">Yin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and subsequently used as a reference database for the metatranscriptomics. The genomes for both Strains and MAGs corresponding to <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> were compared to the reference genome from <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> DSM 5265. Using the BRIG tool (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Alikhan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) for mapping and visualization, the different genomes were mapped against their pan genome generated using Roary (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Page <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>A concatenated ribosomal protein phylogeny was performed on the MAGs and the isolated strains using 16 ribosomal proteins chosen as single-copy phylogenetic marker genes (RpL2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22 and 24, and RpS3, 8, 10, 17 and 19) (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Hug <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The dataset was augmented with metagenomic sequences retrieved from our previous research on the original FREVAR reactor (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Hagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and with sequences from reference genomes identified during the 16S rRNA analysis. Each gene set was individually aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>) and then manually curated to remove end gaps and ambiguously aligned terminal regions. The curated alignments were concatenated and a maximum likelihood phylogeny was obtained using MEGA7 (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The radial tree was visualized using iTOL (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Letunic and Bork 2016</xref>). Additionally, an average nucleotide identity (ANI) comparison was performed between each MAG and their closest relative using the ANI calculator (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-R and Konstantinidis 2016</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Temporal meta-omic analyses of SEM1b</title>
<p>A &#x201C;meta-omic&#x201D; time series analysis was conducted over the lifetime span of the SEM1b consortium (&#x2248;45hours). A collection of 27 replicate bottles containing ATCC medium 1943 with 10g/L of cellulose, were inoculated from the same SEM1b culture, and incubated at 65&#x00B0;C in parallel. For each sample time point, three culture-containing bottles were removed from the collection and processed in triplicate. Sampling occurred over nine time-points (at 0, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38 and 43 hours) during the SEM1b life-cycle, and are hereafter referred as T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8, respectively. DNA for 16S rRNA gene analysis was extracted (as above) from T1 to T8 and kept at -20&#x00B0;C until amplification and sequencing, and the analysis was performed using the protocol described above. Due to low cell biomass at the initial growth stages, sampling for metatranscriptomics was performed from T2 to T8. Sample aliquots (6 ml) were treated with RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions and the treated cell pellets were kept at -80&#x00B0;C until RNA extraction.</p>
<p>In parallel, metadata measurements including cellulose degradation rate, monosaccharide production and protein concentration were performed over all the nine time points (T0-T8). For monosaccharide detection, 2 ml samples were taken in triplicates, centrifuged at 16000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes and the supernatants were filtered with 0.2&#x03BC;m sterile filters and boiled for 15 minutes before being stored at -20&#x00B0;C until processing. Solubilized sugars released during microbial hydrolysis were identified and quantified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperiometric detection (PAD). A Dionex ICS3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with a CarboPac PA1 column (2 &#x00D7; 250 mm; Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and connected to a guard of the same type (2 &#x00D7; 50 mm), was used. Separation of products was achieved using a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min in a 30-minute isocratic run at 1 mM KOH at 30&#x00B0;C. For quantification, peaks were compared to linear standard curves generated with known concentrations of selected monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose and galactose) in the range of 0.001-0.1 g/L.</p>
<p>Total proteins measurements were taken to estimate SEM1b growth rate. Proteins were extracted following a previously described method (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Hagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) with a few modifications. Briefly, 30ml culture aliquots were centrifuged at 500 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes to remove the substrate and the supernatant was centrifuged at 9000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes to pellet the cells. Cell lysis was performed by resuspending the cells in 1ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2mM EDTA) and keeping them on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were disrupted in 3 x 60 second cycles using a FastPrep24 (MP Biomedicals, USA) and the debris were removed by centrifugation at 16000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes. Supernatants containing proteins were transferred into low bind protein tubes and the proteins were quantified using Bradford&#x2019;s method (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Bradford 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Because estimation of cellulose degradation requires analyzing the total content of a sample to be accurate, the measurements were performed on individual cultures that were prepared separately. A collection of 18 bottles (9 time points in duplicate) were prepared using the same inoculum described above, and grown in parallel with the 27-bottle collection used for the meta-omic analyses. For each time point, the entire sample was recovered, centrifuged at 5000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellets were boiled under acidic conditions as previously described (<xref rid="c76" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and the dried weights, corresponding to the remaining cellulose, were measured.</p>
<p>mRNA extraction was performed in triplicate on time points T2 to T8, using previously described methods (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Gifford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) with the following modifications in the processing of the RNA. The extraction of the mRNA included the addition of an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA as an internal standard to estimate the number of transcripts in the natural sample compared with the number of transcripts sequenced. The standard was produced by the linearization of a pGem-3Z plasmid (Promega, USA) with ScaI (Roche, Germany). The linear plasmid was purified with a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and digestion of the plasmid was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA fragment was transcribed into a 994nt long RNA fragment with the Riboprobe <italic>in vitro</italic> Transcription System (Promega, USA) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. Residual DNA was removed using the Turbo DNA Free kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The quantity and the size of the RNA standard was measured with a 2100 bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent).</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using enzymatic lysis and mechanical disruption of the cells and purified with the RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (Protocol 2, Qiagen, USA). The RNA standard (25ng) was added at the beginning of the extraction in every sample. After purification, residual DNA was removed using the Turbo DNA Free kit, and free nucleotides and small RNAs such as tRNAs were cleaned off with a lithium chloride precipitation solution according to ThermoFisher Scientific&#x2019;s recommendations. To reduce the amount of rRNAs, samples were treated to enrich for mRNAs using the MICROBExpress kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Successful rRNA depletion was confirmed by analyzing both pre- and post-treated samples on a 2100 bioanalyzer instrument. Enriched mRNA was amplified with the MessageAmp II-Bacteria Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) following manufacturer&#x2019;s instruction and sent for sequencing at the Norwegian Sequencing Center (NSC, Oslo, Norway). Samples were subjected to the TruSeq stranded RNA sample preparation, which included the production of a cDNA library, and sequenced with paired-end technology (2x125bp) on one lane of a HiSeq 3000 system.</p>
<p>RNA reads were assessed for overrepresented features (adapters/primers) using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>), and ends with detected features and/or a Phred score lower than 20 were trimmed using Trimmomatic v.0.36 (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Bolger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Subsequently, a quality filtering was applied with an average Phred threshold of 30 over a 10nt window and a minimum read length of 100nt. rRNA and tRNA were removed using SortMeRNA v.2.1b (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Kopylova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). SortMeRNA was also used to isolate the reads originating from the pGem-3Z plasmid. These reads were mapped against the specific portion of the plasmid containing the Ampr gene using Bowtie2 (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Langmead 2012</xref>) with default parameters and the number of reads per transcript was quantified. The remaining reads were pseudoaligned against the metagenomic dataset, augmented with the annotated strains, using Kallisto pseudo &#x2013;pseudobam (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Bray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The resulting output was used to generate mapping files with bam2hits, which were used for expression quantification with mmseq (<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">Turro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Of the 40126 ORFs identified from the assembled SEM1b metagenome and two <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains, 16060 (40&#x0025;) were not found to be expressed, whereas 21482 (54&#x0025;) were expressed and could be reliably quantified due to unique hits (reads mapping unambiguously against one unique ORF) (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). The remaining 2584 ORFs (6&#x0025;) were expressed, but identified only with shared hits (reads mapping ambiguously against more than one ORF, resulting in an unreliable quantification of the expression of each ORF) (<bold>Figure S1B</bold>). Since having unique hits improves the expression estimation accuracy, the ORFs were grouped using mmseq in order to improve the precision of expression estimates, with only a small reduction in biological resolution (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">Turro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The process first collapses ORFs into expression groups if they have 100&#x0025; sequence identity and then further collapses ORFs (or expression groups) if they acquire unique hits as a group (<bold>Figure S1C</bold>). This process generated 39242 expression groups of which 38535 (98&#x0025;) were singletons (groups composed of single ORF) and 707 (2&#x0025;) were groups containing more than one homologous ORF. From the initial 2584 low-information ORFs, 1333 became part of an expression group containing unique hits, 116 became part of ambiguous group (no unique hits) and 1135 remained singletons (without unique hits). All expression groups without unique hits were then excluded from the subsequent analysis. A total of 21482 singletons and 594 multiple homologous expression groups were reliably quantified between <italic>BWF2A, SW3C</italic> and the SEM1b metatranscriptome (<bold>Figure S1C</bold>).</p>
<p>In order to normalize the expression estimates, sample sizes were calculated using added internal standards, as described previously (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Gifford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The number of reads mapping on the defined region of the internal standard molecule were calculated to be 2.2x10&#x005E;7 &#x002B;/&#x2212; 2.2x10&#x005E;6 reads per sample out of 6.2x10&#x005E;9 molecules added. Using this information, the estimated number of transcript molecules per sample was computed to be 5.1x10&#x005E;12 &#x002B;/&#x2212; 3.7x10&#x005E;12 transcripts. The resulting estimates for the sample sizes were used to scale the expression estimates from mmseq collapse and to obtain absolute expression values. During initial screening the sample T7C (time point T7, replicate C) was identified as an outlier using principle component analysis (PCA) and removed from downstream analysis.</p>
<p>The expression groups were clustered using hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance. Clusters were identified using the Dynamic Tree Cut algorithm (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Langfelder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) with hybrid mode, deepsplit=1 and minClusterSize=7. Eigengenes were computed for the clusters and clusters with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) greater than 0.8 were merged. The MAG/strain enrichment of the clusters was assessed using the BiasedUrn R package. The p-values were corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and the significance threshold was set to 0.01. Expression groups composed of multiple MAGs/strains were included in several enrichment tests.</p>

<title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>The SEM1b consortium is a simplistic community, co-dominated by Clostridium thermocellum and heterogeneic C. proteolyticus strains</title>
<p>Molecular analysis of a reproducible, cellulose-degrading and biogas-producing consortium (SEM1b) revealed a stable and simplistic population structure that contained approximately seven populations, several of which consisted of multiple strains (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S2-S3</bold>). 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the SEM1b consortium was co-dominated by OTUs affiliated to the genera <italic>Clostridium</italic> (52&#x0025;) and <italic>Coprothermobacter</italic> (41&#x0025;), with closest representatives identified as <italic>Clostridium (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum</italic>, an uncharacterized <italic>Clostridium spp.</italic> and three <italic>Coprothermobacter</italic> phylotypes (<bold>Table S2</bold>). Previous meta-omic analysis on the parent Frevar reactor, revealed a multitude of numerically dominant <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains, which created significant assembly and binning related issues (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Hagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In this study, multiple oligotypes of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> were also found (<bold>Table S2</bold>). We therefore sought to isolate and recover axenic representatives to complement our meta-omic approaches, and using traditional anaerobic isolation techniques, we were successful in recovering two novel axenic strains (hereafter referred to as <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic>). The genomes of <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> were sequenced and assembled and subsequently incorporated into our metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis below.</p>

<p>Shotgun metagenome sequencing of two SEM1b samples (D1B and D2B), generated 290Gb (502M paired-end reads) and 264Gb (457M paired-end reads) of data, respectively. Co-assembly of both datasets using strain-depleted reads with Metaspades produced 20760 contigs totalizing 27Mbp with a maximum contig length of 603Kbp. Functional annotation resulted in 36292 annotated ORFs and taxonomic binning revealed 11 MAGs and a community structure similar to the one observed by 16S analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S3</bold>). A total of eight MAGs exhibited good completeness &#x003E; 80&#x0025; and a low level of contamination (&#x003C; 10&#x0025;). Three MAGs, COPR2, COPR3 and SYNG2 corresponded to small and incomplete MAGs, although Blastp analysis suggest COPR2 and COPR3 likely represent <italic>Coprothermobacter-</italic> affiliated strain elements.</p>
<p>All near-complete MAGs (&#x003E; 80&#x0025;) as well as <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> were phylogenetically compared against their closest relatives using average nucleotide identities (ANI) and a phylogenomic tree was constructed via analysis of 16 concatenated ribosomal proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). The COPR1 MAG was observed to cluster together with <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> DSM 5265 and the two strains <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C.</italic> Two MAGs (RCLO1-CLOS1) clustered together within the <italic>Clostridium</italic>; RCLO1 with the well-known <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, whereas CLOS1 grouped together with another <italic>Clostridium</italic> MAG generated from the FREVAR dataset and the isolate <italic>C. stercorarium</italic> (ANI: 79.1&#x0025;). Both RCLO1 and CLOS1 encoded broad plant polysaccharide degrading capabilities, containing 290 and 160 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), respectively (<bold>Table S4</bold>). RCLO1 in particular encoded cellulolytic (e.g. glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families GH5, GH9, GH48) and cellulosomal features (dockerins and cohesins), whereas CLOS1 appears more specialized towards hemicellulose degradation (e.g. GH3, GH10, GH26, GH43, GH51, GH130). Surprisingly, CAZymes were also identified in COPR1 (n=30) and both <italic>BWF2A</italic> (n=37) and <italic>SW3C</italic> (n=33) at levels higher than what has previously been observed in <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> DSM 5265 (n=14) (<bold>Table S4</bold>). Several MAGs were also affiliated with other known lineages associated with biogas processes, including <italic>Tepidanaerobacter</italic> (TEPI1-2), <italic>Synergistales</italic> (SYNG1-2), <italic>Tissierellales</italic> (TISS1) and Methanothermobacter (METH1).</p>

<title>Novel strains of C. proteolyticus reveal acquisition of carbohydrate-active enzymes</title>
<p>Genome annotation of COPR1, <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> identified both insertions and deletions in comparison to the only available reference genome, sequenced from the type strain DSM 5265 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Functional annotation showed that most of the genomic differences were sporadic and are predicted not to affect the metabolism of the strains. However, several notable differences were observed, which might represent a significant change in the lifestyle of the isolates. Both isolated strains lost the genes encoding flagellar proteins, while in contrast, they both acquired numerous extra CAZymes. Although both strains encoded a slightly different collection of CAZymes, they both contained a particular genomic region that encoded a cluster of three CAZymes: GH16, GH3 and GH18-CBM35 (region-A, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Other notable CAZy families found throughout the genome included GH36, GH74, GH109, CBM3, CE1 and CE10 as well as GH9, GH8 and GH18 domains co-located with a dockerin. The putative function of these GHs, suggests that both <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> are capable of hydrolyzing amorphous forms of cellulose (GH9: endoglucanase, CBM3: cellulose-binding) and/or different hemicellulosic substrates (GH16: endo-1,3(4)-&#x03B2;-glucanase / xyloglucanase; GH3: &#x03B2;-glucosidase / 1,4-&#x03B2;-xylosidase; GH36: &#x03B1;-galactosidase) (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">&#x00C1;lvarez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), which are significant fractions of the spruce-derived cellulose substrate (glucan: 88.3&#x0025;, xylan: 4.5&#x0025;, mannan: 4.8&#x0025;, (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Chylenski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>)). Regarding the putative GH18s encoded in both strains (2 ORFs, with and without a dockerin), it could play a role in bacterial cell wall recycling (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) as an endo-&#x03B2;-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Indeed, <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> has previously been considered to be a scavenger of dead cells, even though this feature was mainly highlighted in term of proteolytic activities (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">L&#x00FC; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking a closer look, the region-A of CAZymes (GH16, GH3, GH18-CBM35) in <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> was located on the same chromosomal cassette but organized onto two different operons with opposite directions (<bold>Figure S2A</bold>). Comparison of the genes and their organization, revealed a high percentage of gene similarity and synteny with genome representatives of <italic>Fervidobacterium nodosum</italic> (Phylum: Thermotogae) and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> (<bold>Table S5</bold>). Both populations were previously identified in the original Frevar reactor (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Hagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> representatives are also found in SEM1b (RCLO1). Examination of the flanking regions surrounding the CAZymes in region-A, reveals the presence of an incomplete prophage composed of a phage lysis holin and two recombinases located downstream (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Figure S2A</bold>). Further comparisons with <italic>F. nodosum</italic> and <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> illustrated that only the later encodes the same prophage elements, together with an additional terminase and more phage component proteins on the 5&#x2019; region (<bold>Figure S2B</bold>). Aside from region-A, most CAZymes encoded within <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> genomes also exhibited high similarity to representatives from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> (<bold>Table S5</bold>). Considering the high sequence homology and presence of phage-genes, it could be hypothesized that genomic regions encoding CAZymes in <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> are the result of HGT originating from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> and <italic>F. nodosum</italic>. HGT within anaerobic digesters has been reported for antibiotic resistance genes (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), whereas HGT of CAZymes have been detected previously among gut microbiota (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Hehemann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Ricard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Since many microbes express only a specific array of carbohydrate-degrading capabilities, bacteria that acquire CAZymes from phages may gain additional capacities and consequently, a selective growth advantage (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Modi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, several <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> CAZymes were found to encode a GH domain coupled with a dockerin (GH-doc) (<bold>Table S5</bold>), which are typical building block of cellulosomes. Cellulosomes are multi-enzyme complexes produced by anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass, and were first discovered in <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Lamed et al., 1983</xref>). These complexes are composed of two main types of building blocks: dockerin-containing enzymatic subunits and cohesin-containing structural proteins called scaffoldins (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Artzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, no cohesins were detected in <italic>BWF2A</italic> or <italic>SW3C</italic>. Dockerin-only containing genomes have previously been observed, however they remain poorly understood (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Dassa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In addition to cellulosome building blocks, examination of the genome regions flanking a GH8 encoded in <italic>BWF2A</italic> (GH8, IMG geneID: 2731989313), revealed both anti-sigma and RNA polymerase sigma factors (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). Previous studies have shown that cellulosomal genes are regulated by anti-sigma factors and alternative sigma factors in a substrate-dependent way (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Artzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Nataf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and are unique to <italic>C. thermocellum (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Kahel-Raifer et al., 2010</xref>)</italic>. The anti-sigma system encoded upstream to the <italic>BWF2A</italic> GH8 exhibited 99&#x0025; sequence identity to the corresponding <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> genes that harbor the same gene organization (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). Together, the high gene similarity, and presence of GH-doc domains and the anti-sigma factors supports our previous assertions that many of the GHs present in <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> originated from <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>. Since the anti-sigma factor has an exocellular CBM-like component to detect the presence of a particular substrate, it is tempting to speculate that GHs from <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> could be expressed and bind the complementary cohesin modules produced by <italic>C. thermocellum.</italic></p>

<title>C. proteolyticus expresses CAZymes and is implicit in polysaccharide degradation within the SEM1b consortium</title>
<p>To better understand the role(s) played by <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> in a saccharolytic consortium, a temporal metatranscriptomic analyses of SEM1b over a complete life cycle was performed. 16S rRNA gene analysis of eight time points (T1-8) over a 43hr period reaffirmed that <italic>C. thermocellum-</italic> and <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic>-affiliated populations dominate SEM1b over time (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Highly similar genes from different MAGs/genomes were grouped together in order to obtain &#x201C;expression groups&#x201D; with discernable expression profiles (see <bold>Methods</bold> and <bold>Figure S1A</bold>/<bold>B</bold>). A total of 408 singleton CAZyme expression groups and 13 multiple ORF groups were collectively detected in the two <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains and MAGs suspected of contributing to polysaccharide degradation (RCLO1, CLOS1, COPR1-3, and TISS1, <bold>Figure S1D</bold>, <bold>Table S6</bold>).

For example, all GHs within region-A could be identified as expressed by at least one of the isolated strains but could not be resolved further between the strains. In contrast, the GH9-doc and GH8-doc ORFs were unambiguously expressed and could not be resolved between <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> and the RCLO1 MAG, whereas GH8, GH18 and CBM3 ORFs were expressed by at least one of the <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> strains but could not be resolved further.</p>

<p>From the CAZymes subset of expression groups, a cluster analysis was performed to reveal eight expression clusters (I-VIII, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Clusters I and II comprised 13 and 10 expression groups (respectively) and followed a similar profile over time (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>), increasing at earlier stages (T2-3) and again at later stationary/death stages (T6-8). Both clusters were enriched for <italic>C. proteolyticus-</italic>affiliated MAGs and isolated strains and predominately consisted of CAZymes targeting linkages associated with N-acetylglucosamine (CE9, CE14), peptidoglycan (GH23, GH18, GH73) and chitosan (GH8), suggesting a role in bacterial cell wall hydrolysis (<bold>Table S6</bold>). This hypothesis was supported by 16S rRNA gene data, which illustrated that <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic>-affiliated populations (OTU2) were high at initial stages of the SEM1b life-cycle when cell debris was likely present in the inoculum that was sourced from the preceding culture at stationary phase (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). At T2, the abundance of <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>-affiliated populations (OTU-1) was observed to outrank <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> as the community predictably shifted to cellulose-utilization. However, towards stationary phase (T6-8) when dead cell debris is expected to be increasing, expression levels in clusters I and II were maintained at high levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), which was consistent with high <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> 16S rRNA gene abundance at the same time-points.</p>
<p>Cluster IV, which was the second largest with 161 expression groups, was enriched with the RCLO1 MAG that was closely related to <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>. As expected, numerous expressed genes in cluster IV were inferred in cellulosome assembly (via cohesin and dockerin domains) as well as cellulose (e.g. GH5, GH9, GH44, GH48, CBM3) and hemicellulose (e.g. GH10, GH26, GH43, GH74) hydrolysis (<bold>Table S6</bold>). This cluster was increasing throughout the consortium&#x2019;s exponential phase (time points T1-4, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>), whilst 16S rRNA data also shows <italic>C. thermocellum-</italic>affiliated populations at high levels during the same stages (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> GH18-doc was also found in cluster IV. A GH9-doc and GH8-doc encoded in <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> were also expressed, however they exhibited 99-100&#x0025; identity to <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> representatives (<bold>Table S5</bold>) and formed expression groups without unique hits, hence they were not part of the clustering (<bold>Table S6</bold>). Since cellulosomal genes are seemingly expressed collectively in order to facilitate coordinated assembly, finding the GH18 in the same cluster is not overly surprising. However, the fact that the gene is expressed by a different bacterium to the one creating the bulk of the cellulosome machinery (i.e. RCLO1) makes it extremely interesting and supports the possibility that &#x201C;multi-species&#x201D; cellulosomes putatively exist. Although species-specific high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interactions are required for cellulosome assembly (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Pag&#x00E8;s <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), the <italic>C. thermocellum-</italic>origin and high homology of the <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> GH18 gene lends itself to the hypothesis that once expressed, the GH18 will bind to a RCLO1 cohesin domain and be part of the resulting cellulosomes. Obviously, much more experimental validation is required to confirm physical interactions between <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> GH-doc representatives and cellulosome assemblies.</p>
<p>ORFs from both <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> as well as CLOS1 were enriched in cluster VI, which was determined as the largest with 193 expression groups. CLOS1 in particular expressed many genes involved in hemicellulose deconstruction (e.g. GH3, GH5, GH10, GH29, GH31, GH43 and GH130) and carbohydrate deacetylation (e.g. CE1, CE4, CE7, CE9, CE12) (<bold>Table S6</bold>). Expressed cluster VI genes from <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> -affiliated genomes/MAGs were also inferred in hemicellulose-degradation, including GH3, GH16, GH74, CE1, CE4, CE9 and CE10 (<bold>Table S6</bold>). In particular, the GH16 and GH3-encoding ORFs from region-A within <italic>BWF2A</italic> and <italic>SW3C</italic> were detected in cluster VI, which reaffirms our earlier predictions that certain <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> populations in SEM1b are capable of degrading hemicellulosic substrates. The expression profile of cluster VI over time was observed to slightly lag after cluster IV (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>), suggesting that hemicellulases in cluster VI genes are expressed once the hydrolytic effects of the RCLO1-cellulosome (expressed in cluster IV) have liberated hemicellulosic substrates (<xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">Zverlov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005b</xref>). Although <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> cannot readily utilize other carbohydrates besides cellodextrins (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Demain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), the cellulosome is composed of a number of hemicellulolytic enzymes such as GH10 endoxylanases, GH26 mannanases and GH74 xyloglucanases (<xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">Zverlov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>), which are involved in the deconstruction of the underlying cellulose-hemicellulose matrix (<xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">Zverlov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005b</xref>). Representatives of GH10, GH26 and GH74 from RCLO1 were all expressed in cluster IV and are presumably acting on the hemicellulose fraction present in the spruce-derived cellulose (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Chylenski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, detection of hydrolysis products (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>), revealed that xylose increased significantly at T5-7, indicating that hemicellulosic polymers containing beta-1-4-xylan were likely available at these stages. In addition to cluster VI, clusters V, VII and VIII also exhibited expression profiles that gradually increased after the initial peak of cluster IV. These clusters were all found to contain many enzymes putatively targeting medium and short length carbohydrate chains, including those derived from xylan sources (<bold>Table S6</bold>).</p>
<p>All in all, the SEM1b expression data shows sequential community progression that co-ordinates hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose as well as carbohydrates that are found in the microbial cell wall. In particular, <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> populations in SEM1b were suspected to play key roles degrading microbial cell wall carbohydrates as well as hemicellulosic substrates, possibly in cooperation or in parallel to other clostridium populations at the later stages of the SEM1b growth cycle. The detection and expression of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> -affiliated GH-doc enzymes also raises intriguing questions regarding the possibility of multi-species cellulosomes and their potential role in saccharolytic consortia.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Unraveling the interactions occurring in a complex microbial community composed of closely related species or strains is an arduous task. Here, we have leveraged culturing techniques, metagenomics and time-resolved metatranscriptomics to describe a novel <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> population that is comprised of closely related strains that have acquired sets of CAZymes via HGT and putatively evolved to incorporate a saccharolytic lifestyle. The co-expression patterns of <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic> CAZymes in clusters I and II supports the adaptable role of this bacterium as a scavenger that is able to hydrolyze cell wall polysaccharides during initial phases of growth and in the stationary / death phase, when available sugars are low. Moreover, the acquisition of hemicellulases by <italic>C. proteolyticus</italic>, and their expression in cluster VI at time points when hemicellulose is available, further enhances its metabolic versatility and provides substantial evidence as to why this population dominates thermophilic reactors on a global scale, even when substrates are poor in protein.</p>
