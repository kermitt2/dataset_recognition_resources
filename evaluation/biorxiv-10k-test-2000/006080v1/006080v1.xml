<p>Comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of genome functions requires identification of molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have developed the insertional chromatin immunoprecipitatin (iChIP) technology to isolate specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions and identify their associated molecules. iChIP consists of locus-tagging and affinity purification.

<title>Background</title>
<p>Genome functions are mediated by various molecular complexes in the context of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of genome functions requires identification of molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we recently developed the locus-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technologies consisting of insertional ChIP (iChIP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated ChIP (enChIP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] to isolate genomic regions of interest retaining molecular interactions. The functions of the genomic regions can be comprehensively understood by analysis of DNA, RNA, proteins, or other molecules interacting with the genomic regions.</p>
<p>In principle, iChIP is based on the locus-tagging strategy to isolate specific genomic regions using exogenous DNA-binding molecules. In contrast, enChIP is based on recognition of endogenous DNA sequences by engineered DNA-binding molecules such as TAL proteins and the CRISPR system. The scheme of iChIP is as follows: (i) The recognition sequences of an exogenous DNA-binding protein such as a bacterial protein, LexA, are inserted into the genomic region of interest in the cell to be analyzed. (ii) The DNA-binding domain (DB) of the exogenous DNA-binding protein is fused with a tag(s) and a nuclear localization signal(s) (NLS) and expressed in the cell to be analyzed. (iii) The resultant cell is stimulated and crosslinked with formaldehyde or other crosslinkers, if necessary. (iv) The cell is lysed, and the chromatin DNA is fragmented by sonication or enzymatic digestion. (v) The complexes including the exogenous DB are immunoprecipitated with antibody (Ab) against the tag(s). (vi) The isolated complexes which retain molecular interactions are reverse crosslinked, if necessary, and subsequent purification of DNA, RNA, proteins, or other molecules allows their identification and characterization. We successfully identified proteins and RNA components of an insulator, which functions as boundaries of chromatin domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], by using iChIP combined with mass spectrometry (iChIP-MS) or RT-PCR (iChIP-RT-PCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Thus, iChIP is a useful technology for elucidation of molecular mechanisms of genome functions.</p>
<p>We recently developed 3xFNLDD, the second-generation tagged LexA DB consisting of 3xFLAG-tags, an NLS, and DB plus the dimerization domain of LexA, to utilize in iChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. 3xFNLDD is expressed in the cell to be analyzed for binding to the inserted LexA BE and subsequent purification of target genomic regions in the iChIP technology. If target genomic regions inserted with LexA BE can be pulled down using recombinant 3xFNLDD conjugated to Ab against the tags (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), expression of 3xFNLDD in the cell to be analyzed would not be necessary. In addition, it is not necessary to consider unexpected side effects of expression of 3xFNLDD on cell behavior, if any, making the procedure more straightforward.</p>

The resultant cell is stimulated and crosslinked with formaldehyde or other crosslinkers, if necessary. The cell is lysed, and the genomic DNA is fragmented. The target genomic region is affinity purified with r3xFNLDD-D conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody (Ab). After revers crosslinking, if necessary, purification of the chromatin components (DNA, RNA, proteins, other molecules) allows their identification and characterization.</p></caption>

<p>In this study, we developed the iChIP system using the recombinant C-terminally Dock-tagged 3xFNLDD (3xFNLDD-D). Recombinant 3xFNLDD-D (r3xFNLDD-D) was expressed using a silkworm-baculovirus expression system and purified by affinity purification. iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D could effectively isolate the single-copy chicken <italic>Pax5</italic> (c<italic>Pax5</italic>) locus from a chicken B cell line, DT40. In addition, we could detect RNA associated with the c<italic>Pax5</italic> locus using this form of the iChIP system combined with RT-PCR. Thus, iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D would be more straightforward and useful to isolate specific genomic regions for their biochemical analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title><bold>Expression and purification of 3xFNLDD-D</bold></title>
<p>For preparation of the purified r3xFNLDD-D, we utilized a silkworm-baculovirus expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In this system, 3xFNLDD-D was expressed in a silkworm pupa by infection of baculoviruses expressing 3xFNLDD-D. The expressed protein was purified from the pupal homogenates using Dock Catch Resin, which specifically bound to Dock-tag in a calcium-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining detected a single protein band at 35 kDa in the elution fraction. This protein was confirmed as 3xFNLDD-D by immunoblot analysis with anti-Dock Ab (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, 3xFNLDD-D could be expressed in a silkworm pupa and purified without visible degradation.</p>

<title>Efficient isolation of a target genomic region by iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether the purified r3xFNLDD-D could be utilized for isolation of genomic regions of interest from vertebrate cells. To this end, we used the chicken DT40-devivative cell line, DT40&#x0023;205-2, in which 8 x repeats of LexA BE were inserted 0.3 kbp upstream of the exon 1A of the single-copy endogenous c<italic>Pax5</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The crosslinked chromatin prepared from the cell line was subjected to iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. After purification of the immunoprecipitated genomic DNA, the yield of the c<italic>Pax5</italic> 1A promoter region was evaluated by detection of the LexA BE site (LexA BE) and the region 0.2 kbp upstream of LexA BE (i.e., 0.7 kbp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of c<italic>Pax5</italic> exon 1A) (-0.7k) by real-time PCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, the yield of LexA BE and -0.7k were more than 20&#x0025; and 5&#x0025; of input, respectively, when 10 &#x00B5;g of each r3xFNLDD-D and anti-FLAG Ab were used. In contrast, the yield of the genomic region 10 kbp upstream of the TSS of the exon 1A (-10k) was less than 0.01&#x0025;. These results suggested that r3xFNLDD-D can bind to LexA BE even in the crosslinked chromatin and iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D is able to specifically purify target genomic regions. The specific isolation of the c<italic>Pax5</italic> 1A promoter region was completely blocked when we inhibited binding of r3xFNLDD-D to anti-FLAG Ab with excessive amounts of 3xFLAG peptide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The c<italic>Pax5</italic> 1A promoter region was not isolated when parental DT40 was used instead of DT40&#x0023;205-2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These results clearly demonstrated that isolation of target genomic regions is mediated by binding of LexA BE with r3xFNLDD-D captured by anti-FLAG Ab.</p>

<title>Optimization of iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D</title>
<p>Next, we titrated amounts of r3xFNLDD-D and anti-FLAG Ab to optimize the system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The yield of the LexA BE site in the c<italic>Pax5</italic> 1A promoter was comparable when 0.5 - 10 &#x03BC;g of each r3xFNLDD-D and anti-FLAG Ab was used with chromatin prepared from 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> DT40&#x0023;205-2 cells. In contrast, use of 0.01 - 0.1 &#x03BC;g of each protein showed lower yield, suggesting that 0.5 &#x03BC;g of each r3xFNLDD-D and anti-FLAG Ab are sufficient for 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells. The yield of iChIP using 0.5 &#x03BC;g of r3xFNLDD-D was 20&#x0025; of input for LexA BE and less than 0.01&#x0025; for -10k, which is comparable with that using 10 &#x03BC;g of r3xFNLDD-D (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). We also examined whether it would be possible to purify the c<italic>Pax5</italic> 1A promoter region using r3xFNLDD-D with Dock Catch Resin, which bound to the C-terminal Dock-tag of r3xFNLDD-D. As shown in Supplemental Figure 1, 2&#x0025; of input of the LexA BE site could be isolated with negligible contamination of -10k, indicating that the C-terminal Dock-tag of r3xFNLDD-D can also be utilized for iChIP, although the yield was much lower than that using anti-FLAG Ab.</p>

<title>Isolation of RNA associated with the c<italic>Pax5</italic> locus by iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D could be utilized to isolate and identify molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest in cells. To this end, we attempted to isolate the c<italic>Pax5</italic> locus including the exon 1A region by iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D and detect the nascent RNA transcribed from the TSS of the c<italic>Pax5</italic> exon 1A by RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The c<italic>Pax5</italic> exon 1A was transcribed even in the presence of LexA BE inserted in the 1A promoter region (Supplemental Figure 2). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D isolated the c<italic>Pax5</italic> exon 1A region but not the exon 3 region of the irrelevant c<italic>AID</italic> gene, which encodes an enzyme essential for B cell-specific immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. After purification of the associated RNA, RT-PCR analysis detected RNA transcribed corresponding to the exon 1A of the c<italic>Pax5</italic> gene but not corresponding to the c<italic>AID</italic> gene in the iChIP sample (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) (the full-length images with size markers are shown in Supplemental Figure S3). These results suggested that iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D is able to isolate specific genomic regions retaining molecules interacting with the genomic regions.</p>

</fig>
<p>In this study, we applied RT-PCR to detection of RNA interacting with a genomic region of interest in cells. Next-generation sequencing or microarray analysis can be combined with iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D for non-biased identification of interacting RNA as well as DNA. Moreover, mass spectrometry can be combined for non-biased identification of interacting proteins.</p>
<p>Because iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D does not require expression of 3xFNLDD in cells, it is of great use in the iChIP analysis of primary cells isolated from organisms, especially higher eukaryotes such as mice. In the case of application of the standard iChIP technology to mice, it is time-consuming to establish mouse lines expressing 3xFNLDD in the cells to be analyzed as well as those possessing LexA BE in specific genomic regions. In this regard, iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D is able to skip the mating steps between mice expressing 3xFNLDD and those possessing LexA BE and the subsequent backcrossing steps, substantially accelerating iChIP analysis using organisms.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we established the iChIP system using r3xFNLDD-D to make the iChIP technology much more straightforward. Using this system, we were able to isolate target genomic regions; &#x0025; of input reached more than 20&#x0025; for the c<italic>Pax5</italic> 1A promoter region. In addition, we could detect RNA associated with the c<italic>Pax5</italic> locus, suggesting that iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D can isolate target genomic regions retaining molecular interactions. Thus, iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D would be more straightforward and useful for analysis of specific genomic regions to elucidate their functions.</p>

The cDNA was used as template for PCR with AmpliTaq Gold 360 Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycles were as follows: heating at 95&#x00B0;C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95&#x00B0;C for 30 sec, 60&#x00B0;C for 30 sec, 72&#x00B0;C for 1 min; and the final extending 72&#x00B0;C for 2 min. The primers used in this experiment are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
