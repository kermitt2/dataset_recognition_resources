<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Apicomplexan parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, contain a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast that functions to produce essential metabolic compounds. It was previously reported that several members of the Clp family of chaperones and proteases localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and in chloroplasts these proteins form complexes that degrade proteins in a proteasome-like manner to regulate key cellular processes, but their function in the apicoplast is completely unknown. In this study, we generated a conditional mutant of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> apicoplast-targeted <italic>pfclpc</italic> gene and found that under normal conditions it localizes to the apicoplast. Knockdown of PfClpC results in growth inhibition and morphological defects, indicating that PfClpC is essential for parasite viability. Upon inhibition, PfClpC loses its apicoplast localization and appears in vesicle-like structures. Other apicoplast-targeted proteins also localize to these structures, suggesting that organelle integrity is compromised. Addition of isopentynyl pyrophosphate completely rescued the growth inhibition, indicating that the only essential function of PfClpC is related to the apicoplast. Moreover, cellular assays suggest that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the ability of the schizont-stage parasites to properly sort functional apicoplast organelles into daughter-merozoites. These data show that PfClpC is an essential gene that functions to maintain apicoplast integrity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The deadly human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, contains a unique organelle called the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid that produces vital metabolites. Members of the prokaryotic&#x2013;derived Clp family were previously reported to localize to the apicoplast. In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp homologs form a proteasome-like complex that degrade proteins but their function in parasite biology is unknown. Here we took a conditional knockdown approach to study an apicoplast localized Clp proteins, PfClpC, which we found to be essential for parasite viability. Inhibition of PfClpC results in a growth arrest phenotype that correlates with a reduced replication rate. We observed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast, however upon inhibition it is found dispersed in vesicle-like structures suggesting a complete breakdown of organelle integrity. Our ability to rescue the phenotype by adding an essential apicoplast-derived metabolite proved that the only essential function of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function. Furthermore, we have found evidence supporting a role for PfClpC in apicoplast sorting into daughter cells. Therefore, we propose PfClpC as a potential drug target due to its essentiality, prokaryotic origin and absence from the human host.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is a devastating human disease caused by obligate intracellular parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. This disease results in nearly 450,000 deaths each year, which are mostly caused by one species, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The life cycle of the parasite is remarkably complex, moving between different cellular niches in a mosquito vector and in the human host. Upon infection, the parasite initially invades liver cells followed by invasion into red blood cells (RBCs), where the parasite numbers expand exponentially via asexual replication. This part of the cycle initiates with the invasion of a diminutive merozoite into the RBC, developing first into the early ring, then a metabolically active trophozoite, and finally a multinucleated schizont that will give rise to multiple merozoite progeny which egress and reinvade fresh RBCs.</p>
<p>This blood stage form of the parasite is responsible for the entirety of malaria-associated morbidity and mortality. Currently, the parasite has gained resistance to all clinically available antimalarial drugs, generating an urgent need to identify new drugs and potential new drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The minute eukaryotic cell of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is remarkably complex with two organelles that carry their own genetic material, the mitochondrion and a unique algal endosymbiont known as the apicoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The apicoplast harbors vital metabolic pathways that are required for parasite growth and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Importantly, drugs that target cellular processes in the apicoplast are clinically effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the function, structure and biogenesis of the apicoplast are essential areas of research that provide a rich vein of antimalarial drug targets.</p>
<p>The parasite specific and essential nature of the apicoplast makes the development of anti-malarial drugs targeting this organelle extremely attractive. Very little is known about the biogenesis and maintenance of the apicoplast organelle, although factors that are required for or regulate these processes may be an important source of anti-malarial drug targets. One potential class of such targets are the caseinolytic protease (Clp) family of proteins that act as key regulators of the biology of bacterial cells, the evolutionary ancestors of the apicoplast. In bacteria and plant chloroplasts, Clp proteins play vital roles in cell/ organelle division, segregation, protein homeostasis and protein transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Typically, they form a regulated proteolytic complex in which a Clp protease is paired with a Clp chaperone that has a AAA&#x002B; ATPase domain (also known as the Hsp100 family of chaperones) such as ClpC or ClpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. There are several putative <italic>clp</italic> genes encoded in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome and it was recently shown that one of them (PfHSP101) is located at the host-parasite interface and is required to transport parasite virulence factors into the infected host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Two other Clp proteins have been localized to the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and six putative Clp&#x2019;s have been localized to the apicoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], yet very little is known about their roles in parasite biology. Although some of their enzymatic activities have been studied <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], their roles <italic>in vivo</italic> remain poorly understood due to the challenging genetics of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and the difficulty in targeting organelle localized genes for molecular study.</p>
<p>Here we studied the role of the previously uncharacterized PfClpC (PF3D7_1406600), an Hsp100 chaperone with a triple AAA&#x002B; ATPase domain. The <italic>pfclpc</italic> gene is conserved in all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, as well as in other apicoplast containing <italic>Apicomplexa</italic>. It encodes a large protein (156 kDa) with a predicted apicoplast transit peptide. Using a conditional knockdown approach, we show that PfClpC activity is essential for parasite survival and growth. Conditional inhibition of PfClpC interferes with apicoplast integrity and the localization of apicoplast proteins. We observe a delayed growth inhibition phenotype, which results from a reduced replication rate that compounds with each subsequent replication cycle. Importantly, we can chemically rescue PfClpC-associated phenotypes using isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) indicating that the only essential role of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function. Finally, we demonstrate that even after prolonged inhibition and a general apicoplast loss, parasites are able to recover from undetectable levels and grow when PfClpC inhibition is reversed. Overall, we show that PfClpC is a vital apicoplast-targeted protein that is essential for parasite viability through its role in apicoplast function.</p>

<title>Generating conditional mutants of PfClpC</title>
<p>In order to examine the biological role of the putative chaperone PfClpC in apicoplast function and parasite biology, we took a genetic approach based on conditional chaperone auto-inhibition. We inserted a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-based destabilization domain (DDD) into the <italic>pfclpc</italic> genomic locus, a technique that was previously used successfully to conditionally inhibit chaperone function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], as well as to knockdown other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). In the chaperone-DDD fusion protein, the unfolded DDD binds the chaperone intra-molecularly, thereby excluding client proteins and inhibiting normal chaperone function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). A small molecule ligand, trimethoprim (TMP) is used to stabilize and refold the DDD, releasing the chaperone to resume its normal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). Using a single crossover homologous recombination strategy, we tagged the C-terminus of the <italic>pfclpc</italic> gene with a triple-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag and the DDD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). We isolated two clones from two independent transfections and analyzed the <italic>pfclpc</italic> locus using a southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Both isolated clones were correctly tagged, and subsequent experiments were done using the two clones, 1G8 and 2E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Henceforth, these parasite lines will also be referred to as PfClpC-DDD.</p>

<p>A. Mechanism of PfClpC conditional inhibition. The <italic>pfclpc</italic> locus was modified to contain a triple hemagglutinin (HA) tag and a DHFR-based destabilization domain (DDD). In the presence of trimethoprim (TMP) the DDD is stable and the chaperone is active. Upon TMP removal the chaperone binds the DDD intra-molecularly and cannot interact with client proteins, inhibiting normal activity.</p>

<p>Using an anti-HA antibody, we confirmed expression of the PfClpC-DDD fusion protein at the expected molecular size in tagged clones but not in the parental line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). The subcellular localization of PfClpC in PfClpC-DDD parasites was observed using immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). We detected expression of tagged PfClpC in distinctive structures throughout the asexual blood stages; punctate in early parasites, elongated in mid-stage trophozoites and multiple foci in individual merozoites in the late schizonts stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>PfClpC is essential for intraerythrocytic growth of malaria parasites</title>
<p>To test the requirement of PfClpC for parasite growth during the asexual blood stages, we removed the stabilizing ligand (TMP) from culturing media and monitored the growth of unsynchronized PfClpC-DDD parasites. A severe and dramatic growth arrest was seen in parasites after TMP withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). We found that inhibition of PfClpC relies on TMP in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 80nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). As expected, based on previously described chaperone-DDD auto-inhibition model, TMP removal did not lead to PfClpC degradation, as protein levels remained constant over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that PfClpC activity is essential for parasite survival and growth within human RBCs.</p>

<p>A. Asynchronous PfClpC-DDD clones, 1G8 and 2E10, were grown with or without 10&#x00B5;M TMP and parasitemia was monitored every 24 hours over 12 days via flow cytometry. During the course of the experiment cultures were cut back and data were calculated using the actual parasitemia multiplied by the dilution factors of each individual culture. 100&#x0025; of relative parasitemia represents the highest value of calculated parasitemia.

<title>PfClpC is required for apicoplast integrity</title>
<p>In order to verify the subcellular localization of PfClpC, we stained cells with anti-HA and anti-acyl carrier protein (ACP), a known apicoplast marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and found that the two co-localize, indicating that under normal conditions PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). After TMP removal, we observed that the integrity of the apicoplast was compromised, as observed by staining of PfClpC and ACP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). Inhibition of PfClpC function resulted in loss of the canonical apicoplast morphology and in the appearance of PfClpC in a punctate, vesicle-like, pattern throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). Moreover, this abnormal localization was also observed for ACP, which was detected in similar vesicle-like structures upon PfClpC inhibition, suggesting damage to apicoplast integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). Apicoplast targeting of nuclear encoded proteins is mediated through an N-terminal transit peptide that is cleaved in the apicoplast to produce the mature protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In correlation with the mislocalization of PfClpC, a second higher band for PfClpC appeared upon TMP removal, suggesting that the N-terminal transit peptide was not cleaved because it did not reach the apicoplast (S1 Fig).</p>

<title>Intraerythrocytic development requires PfClpC</title>
<p>In agreement with apicoplast dysfunction, PfClpC mutants developed normally during the early stages of rings and trophozoite (S2 Fig), but late schizont stages (&#x2264;6 nuclei) developed aberrant morphology, including irregular cellular shape, empty vacuoles and fewer nuclei suggesting that these parasites are nonviable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). These morphologically abnormal parasites appeared on the 3<sup>rd</sup> replication cycle and their fraction increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Analysis of the entire population using flow cytometry revealed that instead of a single peak that usually characterizes a synchronized culture, these late-stage parasites had a wider distribution, further suggesting variation in DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>). To test the viability and replication efficiency of the mixed parasites population, we used a synchronized culture and monitored the rate of schizonts to ring conversion. In agreement with our previous results showing the presence of morphologically abnormal schizonts, TMP removal resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers of parasites that were formed in each successive generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>). This reduced replication rate accounts for the observed growth inhibition as well as the increase in the numbers of morphologically abnormal parasites with each generation.</p>

<title>Chemical rescue of PfClpC-DDD parasites using IPP</title>
<p>The only essential function of the apicoplast during the blood stages is the biosynthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), the precursor for all isoprenoids, through the non-mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. To test the effect of IPP on PfClpC inhibition, we removed TMP and added IPP to the growth media of PfClpC-DDD parasites and observed normal growth as well as typical cellular morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5A and B</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that IPP treated PfClpC-DDD parasites survived in the absence of a functional apicoplast and still retained the multiple vesicle-like structures containing PfClpC and ACP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>). Moreover, quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis supported the visual observation that the apicoplast disappears from these parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>). Importantly, the mitochondrial genome was not similarly affected by PfClpC inhibition indicating that, in addition to a functional damage to the apicoplast, there was an actual loss of the plastid genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>). Overall, we concluded that the only essential activity of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast function.</p>

<p>In order to link the cellular observation of a morphologically mixed PfClpC-DDD population to the phenotypic evidence of apicoplast dysfunction, we aimed to visualize apicoplast presence or absence in early stage parasites (&#x2264;5 hours post invasion). We used Image Stream analysis, which combines flow cytometry with imaging, to analyze these parasites and found that all parasites were positive for PfClpC (S3 Fig and S1 Table). Higher resolution microscopy confirmed that these cells contained PfClpC and that its localization appeared, even in these early stages, in a vesicle-like pattern rather than as a typical discrete apicoplast structure (S4 Fig). This suggests that either newly formed rings inherit these vesicles from their mother cell or that these vesicles represent very early <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of apicoplast proteins.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that apicoplast proteins are synthesized even in absence of the organelle, they are not indicative of apicoplast loss. Therefore, we employed a functional assay to investigate whether PfClpC inhibition results in a mixed population of parasites with and without an apicoplast. We wanted to know, whether or not a small, yet viable, population of parasites containing an intact and functional apicoplast remained in PfClpC-DDD parasites cultured in the absence of TMP. To test this, we first removed TMP and allowed PfClpC-DDD parasites to grow in the presence or absence of IPP for two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). As expected, PfClpC-DDD parasites grown without TMP and supplemented with IPP grew normally, whereas parasites incubated without TMP and without IPP were unable to grow and were undetectable for several days. On day 14 we removed IPP and relieved PfClpC inhibition by adding back TMP, and monitored the growth of the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). Upon addition of TMP to the media, parasites grown in the absence of IPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>) recovered and resumed normal growth, indicating that a small fraction of these parasites indeed possessed a functional apicoplast. Conversely, parasites that were grown with IPP started dying 48 hours after removing IPP and adding back TMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting that these apicoplast-less parasites through continued growth had outcompeted the few remaining parasites that contained a functional apicoplast. Despite restoration of PfClpC activity, once lost, the parasite is not able to generate, <italic>de novo,</italic> the four-membrane apicoplast. Overall, these data indicate that PfClpC-DDD mutants grown in the absence of TMP lose the apicoplast from most parasite progeny with a small, yet observable population still retaining the plastid.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The deadly malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, is a eukaryotic pathogen and as such, it shares conserved basic biology with its human host. It is therefore both challenging and essential, in the search for potential drug targets, to identify key components that are absent or significantly different from the human host. One such potential candidate is the apicoplast-associated prokaryotic Clp family of chaperones and proteases. In the bacterial ancestors, as well as in other organellar descendants such as the mitochondria and chloroplast, these proteins serve a variety of basic molecular functions ranging from protein degradation, transport across membranes, protein folding, cell division, stress response and pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. These have placed bacterial Clp proteins at the center of several drug discovery programs, and have led to the identification of potent and specific inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Very little is known, however, about the functional roles of the apicoplast-resident Clp proteins in the biology of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study we identified an essential Clp family member, PfClpC, a nuclear encoded gene that is transported to the apicoplast where it is required for the integrity of the organelle. Using a conditional knockdown approach, we demonstrated that PfClpC activity is essential for parasite growth and viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The growth defect of PfClpC-DDD parasites is linked to a failure in apicoplast integrity in several ways. We showed that PfClpC localizes to the apicoplast under normal conditions, but appears, along with other apicoplast proteins, in vesicle like structures upon PfClpC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). Several studies reported the appearance of such structures when the apicoplast integrity is compromised, for example with the use of certain antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This was interpreted as stalled vesicular transport that has left the ER but cannot dock to the apicoplast surface due to loss of the organelle.</p>
<p>Moreover, chemical rescue using IPP restored PfClpC-DDD growth as well as recovered normal cellular morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). It has been shown that isoprenoid biosynthesis is the only essential metabolic function of the apicoplast, and supplementing IPP can replace a non-functional apicoplast in living parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Indeed, the IPP supplemented parasites grew normally but microscopic imaging revealed the presence of punctate structures, which are indicative of apicoplast loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>). This was also supported by qRT-PCR analysis that demonstrated a decrease in the ratio of nuclear to apicoplast genome, highlighting an actual loss of the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>). We therefore concluded that the only essential function of PfClpC is linked to apicoplast biology.</p>
<p>Inhibition of essential apicoplast metabolic pathways with drugs like Fosmidomycin, kills parasites immediately and does not lead to the loss of the organelle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Conversely, inhibition of apicoplast translation or replication with drugs like Doxycycline, allows the parasites to complete one asexual cycle, proceed through the second replication cycle, and die only at the schizont stage of the second cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Similar to the effect of drugs that inhibit apicoplast replication, PfClpC mutants develop normally during the early stages of rings and trophozoite (S2 Fig), but late schizont stages (&#x2264;6 nuclei) exhibited aberrant morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs 4A and C</xref>). These non-viable parasites did not manifest uniformly at the end of the second cycle but appeared on the 3<sup>rd</sup> replication cycle, and their fraction increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). One possible explanation for the delayed growth arrest, as well as the gradual increase in abnormal parasites, is that PfClpC inhibition interferes with the segregation or division of functional apicoplasts into daughter merozoites. As a consequence, a mixed population of viable and non-viable daughter cells is forming after each cycle, diluting overtime the viable parasites in the total culture. Indeed, we observed a significant decrease in the rate of schizont to ring conversion in each successive generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>), clarifying the delayed growth inhibition, and suggesting a possible defect in apicoplast sorting.</p>
<p>Since most apicoplast resident proteins are encoded by the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], they are expressed and sorted into vesicles despite the absence of an apicoplast and therefore could not serve as a proper indicator of apicoplast presence, even in the earliest stages (S3 and S4 Figs and S1 table). We hypothesized that inhibition of PfClpC resulted in an apicoplast segregation or division defect that leads to improper sorting of the organelle into daughter merozoites. Therefore, during every schizogony event only a small fraction of progeny receives an apicoplast from the mother cell. To test the possibility of an apicoplast-related sorting defect, we removed TMP for several replication cycles, inducing persistent growth arrest, and then adding it back and monitoring parasite growth. In the event of a uniform functional damage to all parasites in the culture, PfClpC re-activation would not lead to viable parasites, as <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the apicoplast is impossible. Nonetheless, we observed that re-addition of TMP could restore parasites growth, indicating the presence of a small but undetectable sub-population of parasites that contains a functional apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). This observation further supports a sorting defect rather than a general apicoplast dysfunction in the entire parasite population. Interestingly, TMP addition had the opposite effect on parasites that were rescued with IPP. These parasites started dying 48 hours after removing IPP despite addition of TMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), indicating that re-activation of PfClpC was not enough to sustain viability in a population of parasites that permanently lost the apicoplast. Future work will be needed in order to reveal how exactly PfClpC inhibition affects organelle sorting.</p>
<p>The question remains as to what is the molecular mechanism of PfClpC activity and how does it affect apicoplast function. There are two ClpC homologs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, PfClpC that is a nuclear encoded protein targeted to the apicoplast and PfClpM (PFC10_API0060) that is encoded by the apicoplast genome. Our data show that their functions are not redundant and that PfClpC is essential for parasite survival and apicoplast function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts, ClpC orthologs, together with a ClpP protease, typically form an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that degrades proteins to maintain protein homeostasis in the cell/ organelle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. PfClpC, but not PfClpM, possesses the entire conserved motif that is required to interact with ClpP proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ClpP homolog, PfClpP, was shown to have protease activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and localize to the apicoplast <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Several other studies provided structural data and binding analysis for two other apicoplast Clp proteins, the inactive protease PfClpR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and the adaptor protein PfClpS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. As expected, these two proteins have bacterial and chloroplast homologs, which are essential components of the Clp proteolytic complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, it was shown that interfering with ClpP activity inhibits cell division in Gram-positive bacteria due to changes in rates of substrate degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Further studies are required in order to understand whether a similar complex is indeed formed in the apicoplast of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and whether it plays an essential role in maintaining a functional apicoplast. Such investigation may reveal the link between the apicoplast sorting defect and the proteolytic ClpP/C complex in the form of unknown substrate/s that need to be degraded in order to facilitate proper organelle division and segregation.</p>

<title>Growth assays</title>
<p>For asynchronous growth assays parasites were washed twice and incubated in the required medium. Throughout the course of the experiment parasites were sub-cultured to avoid high parasite density and parasitemia was monitored every 24 hours via flow cytometry. Relative parasitemia at each time point was back calculated based on actual parasitemia multiplied by the relevant dilution factors. Parasitemia in the presence of TMP at the end of each experiment was set as the highest relative parasitemia and was used to normalize parasites growth. Data were fit to exponential growth equations using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)</p>
<p>To generate an EC50 curve for TMP, asynchronous PfClpC-DDD parasites were incubated for 11 days without TMP, and on day 12 were seeded in a 96 well plate with varying concentrations of TMP. Parasitemia was measured after 5 days using flow cytometry. Data were fit to a dose-response equation using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).</p>
<p>To determine replication rate (rings: schizonts ratio), TMP was removed from percoll-isolated schizonts-stage parasites and parasites were allowed to egress and reinvade fresh RBCs. Parasitemia was monitored by flow cytometry and microscopy. The ratio of rings to schizonts was calculated using number of rings arising from schizonts in the previous generation. At the beginning of each replication cycle parasites were re-synchronized using Sorbitol, and sub-cultured when required. For each replication cycle data were normalized to rings: schizonts ratio in the presence of TMP.</p>
<p>To determine the fraction of morphologically aberrant schizonts thin blood smears of synchronized PfClpC-DDD parasites were performed at the final stages of each replication cycle and the fraction of defective cells was calculated based on the total late schizont stage parasite counts.</p>
