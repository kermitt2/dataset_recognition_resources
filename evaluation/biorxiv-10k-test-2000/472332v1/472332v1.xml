<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Current strategies for cartilage cell therapy are mostly based on the use of autologous chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, these cells have limitations of a small number of cells available and of low chondrogenic ability, respectively. Many studies now suggest that fetal stem cells are more plastic than adult stem cells and can therefore more efficiently differentiate into target tissues. This study introduces, efficiency chondrogenic differentiation of fetal cartilage-derived progenitor cells (FCPCs) to adult cells can be achieved using a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture method based on silica nanopatterning techniques. In evaluating the issue of silica nano-particle size (Diameter of 300, 750, 1200 nm), each particle size was coated into the well of a 6-well tissue culture plate. FCPCs (2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well plate) were seeded in each well with chondrogenic medium. In this studys, the 300 nm substrate that formed multi-spheroids and the 1200 nm substrate that showed spreading were due to the cell-cell adhesion force(via N-cadherin) and cell-substrate(via Integrin) force, the 750 nm substrate that formed the mass-aggregation can be interpreted as the result of cell monolayer formation through cell-substrate force followed by cell-cell contact force contraction. We conclude that our 3D spheroid culture system contributes to an optimization for efficient differentiation of FCPC, offers insight into the mechanism of efficient differentiation of engineered 3D culture system, and has promise for wide applications in regeneration medicine and drug discovery fields.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The self-repair of articular cartilage (AC) is difficult when it becomes injured due to its low regenerative capacity caused by the lack of blood supply, low cellularity, and a limited number of progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Over the last years, many studies have utilized mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from various tissues, such as bone marrow, synovial membrane, fat, or cord blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. However, MSCs have also been shown to have limited capacity to differentiate fully into chondrocytes and form intact cartilage tissues both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Meanwhile, a number of studies have shown that stem cells or progenitor cell derived from human fetal tissue is an encouraging cell source for cell therapy and tissue engineering efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In our previous study, we proved the potential of FCPCs as a novel cell source for cartilage engineering. These FCPCs showed high cell yields, proliferating, multi-lineage differentiation ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. These results suggest that FCPCs can serve as a suitable cell source for tissue engineering. Previously, several studies attempted to use fetal cartilage-derived cells in cartilage tissue engineering.</p>
<p>However, the two-dimensional (2D) culture method has important limitations in controlling stem cell differentiation pathways resulting in low differentiation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. To overcome these limitations of the 2D culture, three-dimensional (3D) culture is used as culture condition for cell microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Fuchs et al. reported that ovine fetal cartilage cells formed better cartilage tissue than adult chondrocytes by producing more matrix molecules in the pellet culture. This 3D culture used to enhanced differentiation marker gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and stimulation of cellular ECM secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions are crucial for maintaining cell phenotype and for inducing effective differentiation in stem cells. 3D cell culture methods facilitate greater cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, allowing cells to create an &#x201C;in vivo-like&#x201D; microenvironment and better preserve stem cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and induce re-differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The cell behavior, such as morphology and adhesion, differentiation, is influenced by their surrounding microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This cellular microenvironment is controlled by surface property cues through topographical, mechanical, chemical control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Especially, A number of studies have topographic patterns for influencing cellular behavior, various Nano-post density triggered changes in cell cytoskeletal structure and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], patterns made from Nanosize particles of various diameter was restricted cell spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], a Nano-periodic patterns were significantly increasing the mechanical property in the self-assembled tissue through cytoskeleton alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Based on a these studies, the recent paradigm of attempt induces spheroids formation as 3D culture through patterns substrate was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The aggregation formation process, meanwhile, involves changes in cell morphology, indicative of the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are induced through integrin-mediated cell-material interaction and cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Simply, controlling the cell adhesion molecule enables to regulate the formation cell 3D aggregation.</p>
<p>This study used to fetal cartilage-derived progenitor cells (FCPCs), an important cell in the aggregation process and Nano-patterned substrate that able to control cell adhesion, for manufacture of three-dimensional cartilage constructs. Silica beads are well known by their stability in chemical structure and shape. We investigated for the effects of FCPCs aggregation formation on Nano-patterned substrate through particles that 300-1200nm in diameter. By examining FCPCs morphology and relative adhesion force, adhesion molecule, also, total volume and chondrogenic potential of various 3D constructs. We herein test hypothesis that change of FCPCs adhesive by using Nano-patterned substrate through surface particle-size will be induced 3D aggregation formation. Based on them, we manufactured a three-dimensional cartilage construct and analyzed this phenomenon. These 3D cartilage-like tissues using a 3D aggregation culture system, will be useful for in vitro studies of cartilage tissue engineering and cell therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>

Also, the FCPCs suspensions were treated with EGTA that chelate Ca<sup>2</sup>&#x002B; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). EGTA chelate calcium that is an inhibitor for calcium-dependent, cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction. FCPCs treated with EGTA, widely spread without forming spheroids (S300nm) or the aggregation time was delayed (S750nm). On the other hand, there was no significant difference in S1200nm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study silica bead was coated into the well of a 6-well tissue culture plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Silica beads are chemically inert and extremely stable; they provide a greater surface area for the adhesion of cells and biomolecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. In this study, we manufactured three-dimensional cartilage construct utilizing FCPCs cultured on silica nano-patterned substrate through particle diameters of 750 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The process of aggregation formation for cells on nano-patterned substrate appears to be different from each study. Embryonic stem cells (ESC) were not spreading on the silica colloidal crystal 400nm substrates to the same extent as they did on glass cover slips, the reduction of cell-substrate contacts promotes ESC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Bovine endothelial cells tend to spread less with larger particle size and fewer focal adhesion complexes. In contrast, Mouse preosteoblasts showed increasing their area of contact with larger particle size and many focal adhesion complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. These results suggest that there exists a critical dimension of Nanoparticles size for affecting cell behavior on shape, differentiation, adhesion and these effects can know that cell type specific. Actually, Different results were confirmed from the silica nanopatterned substrate used in this study: MSCs tend to spheroid with larger particle size (350-1200 nm), but it is the multi-spheroids, not one large aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The FCPCs is forming larger aggregations with 300 nm, 750 nm particle size, but not at 1200 nm particles size. According to the result of this study, 750 nm particle size, which forms one large selfaggregation, was most useful, depending on the purpose of this study.</p>
<p>Culturing cells in 3D narutally enhance cell growth, differentiation and function. Although these 3D culture methods are used in many studies, they are limited in that they are not large size enough to be used in clinical applications. Traditional methods such as the use of low attachment plate and hanging drop, pellet culture methods, etc., show that the final aggregation size is very small in micro units and there is a limit on the number of cells for constructing the compacted cell structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In terms of methods pellet culture and rotary culture and orbital shaker have the limitation that external force is needed in the process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Also, the aggregates formation by enzymatically detached cells is likely to break the natural ECM[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In our results, the spontaneous aggregation phenomena seen did not require any external force or enzyme digestion for cell detachment, and formed one large mass-aggregation keeping their naturally networks intact without breaking ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, this aggregation method through nano-patterned substrate suggested herein might lead to a great improvement of general methods. In particular, it is a very superior advantage for use in cartilage tissue engineering.</p>
<p>Spheroid self-assembly consisted of a series of events involving that cell-matrix forces through focal adhesion contacts are generally present in spreading cells. At this stage, the cell forms a monolayer like cell sheets. These cell monolayers undergo contraction through cell-cell contacts force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. A number of studies have confirmed cell adhesion molecule to analyze the cell aggregation mechanism. Among them, we have chosen to N-cadherin involved in cell-cell adhesion and Integrin involved cell-materials adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Cadherin and Integrin are two of the best-studied classes of adhesion receptors. The interaction between integrin and cadherin can direct the localization of forces within cell aggregates through the tensional changes in the actin cytoskeleton[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In this studys, the 300 nm substrate that formed multi-spheroids and the 1200 nm substrate that showed spreading were due to the cell-cell adhesion force (via N-cadherin) and cell-substrate (via Integrin) force, the 750 nm substrate that formed the mass-aggregation can be interpreted as the result of cell monolayer formation through cell-substrate force followed by cell-cell contact force contraction.</p>
<p>In this study, the spatial distribution of the nanoscale is an important feature that has a significant effect on cellular material interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. A thorough review of the effects of feature spacing on integrin adhesion suggests that featured can interfere with integrin binding in any size rage, which is consistent with decreasing cell spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The aggregation of FCPCs on Nano-patterned substrate in the presence of EGTA is shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>. N-cadherin mediated homotypic cell-cell adhesion in a ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> dependent manner. To tease out the potential roles of N-cadherin, the treated with EGTA that chelate Ca<sup>2</sup>&#x002B; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In the results, the possible correlation between aggregation time delay and inhibition of N-cadherin by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> reduction was diminished cell contraction due to inhibition of cell-cell contacts. But, the 1200 nm substrate showed no significant differences between presence and absence of EGTA. It is conceivable that this would be the condition which N-cadherin is less affected. Based on the results, cell adhesion force is affected by the regulation of substrate coated Nano-particle sizes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Collectively, our data can judge that FCPCs aggregation using Nano-patterned substrate of tissue engineered constructs has a beneficial effect on 3D culture for cartilage regeneration compared to conventional 3d culture methods. Self-aggregation phenomena in our experiments can focus on events corresponding to the possibility of Self-aggregation called condensation of mesenchymal cells for chondrocyte differentiation. However, the constructs produced in this study were confirmed only the histological evaluation whether it&#x2019;s effective in cartilage regeneration. Therefore, it is necessary to verify that this construct actually has a cartilage tissue regeneration potential afterwards.</p>
