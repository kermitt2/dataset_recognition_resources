<abstract>
<p>Gene regulation is one of the most ubiquitous processes in biology. But while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here we show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect bacterial promoters in a systematic and scalable way. We demonstrate this method on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> In all cases we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input-output relationships. This method opens up the possibility of exhaustively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in <italic>E. coli</italic> and a wide range of other bacteria.</p>

<p>The sequencing revolution has left in its wake an enormous challenge: the rapidly expanding catalog of sequenced genomes is far outpacing a sequence-level understanding of how the genes in these genomes are regulated. This ignorance extends from viruses to bacteria to archaea to eukaryotes. Even in <italic>E. coli,</italic> the model organism in which transcriptional regulation is best understood, we still have no indication if or how more than half of the genes are regulated (Fig. S1; see also RegulonDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) or EcoCyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)). In other model bacteria such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentus, Vibrio harveyii,</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> far fewer genes have established regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>New approaches are needed for studying regulatory architecture in these and other bacteria. Although an arsenal of genetic and biochemical methods have been developed for dissecting promoter function at individual bacterial promoters (reviewed in Minchin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>)), these methods are not readily parallelized. As a result, they will likely not lead to a comprehensive understanding of full regulatory genomes anytime soon. RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and other high-throughput techniques are increasingly being used to study gene regulation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), but these methods are incapable of revealing either the nucleotide-resolution location of all functional transcription factor binding sites, or the way in which interactions between DNA-bound transcription factors and RNA polymerase modulate transcription.</p>
<p>In recent years a variety of massively parallel reporter assays have been developed for dissecting the functional architecture of transcriptional regulatory sequences in bacteria, yeast, and metazoans. These technologies have been used to infer biophysical models of well-studied loci, to characterize synthetic promoters constructed from known binding sites, and to search for new transcriptional regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). CRISPR assays have also shown promise for identifying longer range enhancer-promoter interactions in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, no approach for using massively parallel reporter technologies to decipher the functional mechanisms of previously uncharacterized regulatory sequences has yet been established.</p>
<p>Here we describe a systematic and scalable approach for dissecting the functional architecture of previously uncharacterized bacterial promoters at nucleotide resolution using a combination of genetic, functional, and biochemical measurements. First, a massively parallel reporter assay (Sort-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)) is performed on a promoter in multiple growth conditions in order to identify functional transcription factor binding sites. DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) are then used to identify the regulatory proteins that recognize these sites. In this way one is able to identify both the functional transcription factor binding sites and cognate transcription factors in previously unstudied promoters. Subsequent massively parallel assays are then performed in gene-deletion strains to provide additional validation of the identified regulators. The reporter data thus generated is also used to infer sequence-dependent quantitative models of transcriptional regulation. In what follows, we first illustrate the overarching logic of our approach through application to four previously annotated promoters: <italic>lacZYA, relBE, marRAB,</italic> and <italic>yebG.</italic> We then apply this strategy to the previously uncharacterized promoters of <italic>purT, xylE,</italic> and <italic>dgoRKADT,</italic> demonstrating the ability to go from complete regulatory ignorance to explicit quantitative models of a promoter&#x2019;s input-output behavior.</p>
<sec id="s1">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To dissect how a promoter is regulated, we begin by performing Sort-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Sort-Seq works by first generating a library of cells, each of which contains a mutated promoter that drives expression of GFP from a low copy plasmid (5-10 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)) and provides a read-out of transcriptional state. We use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort cells into multiple bins gated by their fluorescence level and then sequence the mutated plasmids from each bin. We found it sufficient to sort the libraries into four bins and generated data sets of about 0.5-2 million sequences across the sorted bins (Fig. S3A-D). To identify putative binding sites, we calculate &#x2018;expression shift&#x2019; plots that show the average change in fluorescence when each position of the regulatory DNA is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, top plot). Mutations to the DNA will in general disrupt binding of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), so regions with a positive shift are suggestive of binding by a repressor, while a negative shift suggests binding by an activator or RNA polymerase (RNAP).</p>

<caption><title>Overview of approach to characterize transcriptional regulatory DNA, using Sort-Seq and mass spectrometry.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of Sort-Seq. A promoter plasmid library is placed upstream of GFP and is transformed into cells. The cells are sorted into four bins by FACS and after regrowth, plasmids are purified and sequenced. The entire intergenic region associated with a promoter is included on the plasmid and a separate downstream ribosomal binding site sequence is used for translation of the <italic>GFP</italic> gene. The fluorescence histograms show the fluorescence from a library of the <italic>rel</italic> promoter and the resulting sorted bins. (B) Regulatory binding sites are identified by calculating the average expression shift due to mutation at each position. In the schematic, positive expression shifts are suggestive of binding by repressors, while negative shifts would suggest binding by an activator or RNAP. Quantitative models can be inferred to describe the associated DNA-protein interactions. An example energy matrix that describes the binding energy between an as yet unknown transcription factor to the DNA is shown. By convention, the wild-type nucleotides have zero energy, with blue squares identifying mutations that enhance binding (negative energy), and where red squares reduce binding (positive energy). The wild-type sequence is written above the matrix. (C) DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry is used to identify the putative transcription factor (TF) for an identified repressor site. DNA oligonucleotides containing the target binding site are tethered to magnetic beads and used to purify the target transcription factor from cell lysate. Protein abundance is determined by mass spectrometry and a protein enrichment is calculated as the ratio in abundance relative to a second reference experiment where the target sequence is mutated away.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="239335_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The identified binding sites are further interrogated by performing information-based modeling with the Sort-Seq data. Here we generate energy matrix models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) that describe the sequence-dependent energy of interaction of a transcription factor at each putative binding site. For each matrix, we use a convention that the wild-type sequence is set to have an energy of zero (see example energy matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Mutations that enhance binding are identified in blue, while mutations that weaken binding are identified in red. We also use these energy matrices to generate sequence logos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) which provides a useful visualization of the sequence-specificity (see above matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to identify the putative transcription factors, we next perform DNA affinity chromatography experiments using DNA oligonucleotides containing the binding sites identified by Sort-Seq. Here we apply a stable isotopic labeling of cell culture (SILAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)) approach, which enables us to perform a second reference affinity chromatography that is simultaneously analyzed by mass spectrometry. We perform chromatography using magnetic beads with tethered oligonucleotides containing the putative binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Our reference purification is performed identically, except that the binding site has been mutated away. The abundance of each protein is determined by mass spectrometry and used to calculate protein enrichment ratios, with the target transcription factor expected to exhibit a ratio greater than one. The reference purification ensures that non-specifically bound proteins will have a protein enrichment near one. This mass spectrometry data and the energy matrix models provide insight into the identity of each regulatory factor and potential regulatory mechanisms. In certain instances these insights then allow us to probe the Sort-Seq data further through additional information-based modeling using thermodynamic models of gene regulation. As further validation of binding by an identified regulator, we also perform Sort-Seq experiments in gene deletion strains, which should no longer show the associated positive or negative shift in expression at their binding site.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Sort-Seq recovers the regulatory features of well-characterized promoters</title>
<p>To first demonstrate Sort-Seq as a tool to discover regulatory binding sites <italic>de novo</italic> we began by looking at the promoters of <italic>lacZYA</italic> (<italic>lac</italic>), <italic>relBE</italic> (<italic>rel</italic>), and <italic>marRAB</italic> (<italic>mar</italic>). These promoters have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and provide a useful testbed of distinct regulatory motifs. To proceed we constructed libraries for each promoter by mutating their known regulatory binding sites. (See Supplemental Information Section B and Fig. S3E,F for additional characterization). We begin by considering the <italic>lac</italic> promoter, which contains three <italic>lac</italic> repressor (LacI) binding sites, two of which we consider here, and a cyclic AMP receptor (CRP) binding site. It exhibits the classic catabolic switch-like behavior that results in diauxie when <italic>E. coli</italic> is grown in the presence of glucose and lactose sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Here we performed Sort-Seq with cells grown in M9 minimal media with 0.5&#x0025; glucose. The expression shifts at each nucleotide position are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>, with annotated binding sites noted above the plot. The expression shifts reflect the expected regulatory role of each binding site, showing positive shifts for LacI and negative shifts for CRP and RNAP. The difference in magnitude at the two LacI binding sites likely reflect the different binding energies between these two binding site sequences, with LacI O3 having an <italic>in vivo</italic> dissociation constant that is almost three orders of magnitude weaker than the LacI O1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>

Here cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) at 30&#x00B0;C. The expression shifts identify the known binding sites of Fis and MarA (activators), RNAP, and MarR (repressor). Energy matrices and sequence logos are shown for MarA and RNAP. Annotated binding sites are based on those in RegulonDB.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="239335_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Next we consider the <italic>rel</italic> promoter that transcribes the toxin-antitoxin pair RelE and RelB. It is one of about 36 toxin-antitoxin systems found on the chromosome, with important roles in cellular physiology including cellular persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). When the toxin, RelE, is in excess of its cognate binding partner, the antitoxin RelB, the toxin causes cellular paralysis through cleavage of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Interestingly, the antitoxin protein also contains a DNA binding domain and is a repressor of its own promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). We similarly performed Sort-Seq, with cells grown in M9 minimal media. The expression shifts are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> and were consistent with binding by RNAP and RelBE. In particular, a positive shift was observed at the binding site for RelBE, and the RNAP binding site mainly showed a negative shift in expression.</p>
<p>The third promoter, <italic>mar</italic>, is associated with multiple antibiotic resistance since its operon codes for the transcription factor MarA, which activates a variety of genes including the major multi-drug resistance efflux pump, ArcAB-tolC, and increases antibiotic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The <italic>mar</italic> promoter is itself activated by MarA, SoxS, and Rob (via the so-called mar-box binding site), and further enhanced by Fis, which binds upstream of this marbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Under standard laboratory growth it is under repression by MarR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We found that the promoter&#x2019;s fluorescence was quite dim in M9 minimal media and instead grew libraries in lysogeny broth (LB) at 30&#x00B0; C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Again, the different features in the expression shift plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>) appeared to be consistent with the noted binding sites. One exception was that the downstream MarR binding site was not especially apparent. Both positive and negative expression shifts were observed along its binding site, which may be due to overlap with other features present including the native ribosomal binding site. There have also been reported binding sites for CRP, Cra, CpxR/CpxA, and AcrR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). However the studies associated with these annotations either required overexpression of the associated transcription factor, were computationally predicted, or demonstrated through <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and not necessarily expected under the growth condition considered here.</p>
<p>While each promoter qualitatively showed the expected regulatory behavior in each expression shift plot, it was important to show that we could also recover the quantitative features of binding by each transcription factor. Here we inferred energy matrices and associated sequence logos for the binding sites of RNAP, LacI, CRP, RelBE, MarA, and Fis. These are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A-C</xref> and Fig. S4, and indeed, agreed well with sequence logos generated from known genomic binding sites for these transcription factors (Pearson correlation coefficient r&#x003D;0.5-0.9; see Supplemental Information Section C). For the repressors RelBE and MarR, there was no data available that characterized their sequence specificity with which to compare against. Here, instead, we validated our data by performing Sort-Seq in strains where the <italic>relBE</italic> or <italic>marR</italic> genes were deleted. In each case this resulted in a loss of the expression shift associated with binding by these repressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that the observed features are due to binding by these transcription factors.</p>

<title>Identification of transcription factors with DNA affinity chromatography and quantitative mass spectrometry</title>
<p>It was next important to show that DNA affinity chromatography could be used to identify transcription factors in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In particular, a challenge arises in identifying transcription factors in most organisms due to their very low abundance. In <italic>E. coli</italic> the cumulative distribution in protein copy number shows that more than half have a copy number less than 100 per cell, with 90&#x0025; having copy number less than 1,000 per cell. This is several orders of magnitude below that of many other cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>
<p>We began by applying the approach to known binding sites for LacI and RelBE. For LacI, which is present in <italic>E. coli</italic> in about 10 copies per cell, we used the strongest binding site sequence, Oid (<italic>in vivo K<sub>d</sub></italic> &#x007E; 0.05 <italic>nM</italic>), and the weakest natural operator sequence, O3 (<italic>in vivo K<sub>d</sub></italic> &#x007E; 110 <italic>nM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> we plot the protein enrichments from each transcription factor identified by mass spectrometry. LacI was found with both DNA targets, with fold enrichment greater than 10 in each case, and significantly higher than most of the proteins detected (indicated by the shaded region, which represents the 95&#x0025; probability density region of all proteins detected, including non-DNA binding proteins). Purification of LacI with about 10 copies per cell using the weak O3 binding site sequence are near the limit of what would be necessary for most <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters.</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 4.</label>
<caption><title>DNA affinity purification and identification of LacI and RelBE by mass spectrometry using known target binding sites.</title>
<p>(A) Protein enrichment using the weak O3 binding site and strong synthetic Oid binding sites of LacI. LacI was the most significantly enriched protein in each purification. The target DNA region was based on the boxed area of the <italic>lac</italic> promoter schematic, but with the native O1 sequence replaced with either O3 or Oid. Data points represent average protein enrichment for each detected transcription factor, measured from a single purification experiment. (B) For purification using the RelBE binding site target, both RelB and its cognate binding partner RelE were significantly enriched. Data points show the average protein enrichment from two purification experiments. The target binding site is similarly shown by the boxed region of the <italic>rel</italic> promoter schematic. Data points in each purification show the protein enrichment for detected transcription factors. The gray shaded regions shows where 95&#x0025; of all detected protein ratios were found.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="239335_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To ensure this success was not specific to LacI, we also applied chromatography to the RelBE binding site. RelBE provides an interesting case since the strength of binding by RelB to DNA is dependent on whether RelE is bound in complex to RelB (with at least a 100 fold weaker dissociation constant reported in the absence of RelE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>)). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>, we found over 100 fold enrichment of both proteins by mass spectrometry. To provide some additional intuition into these results we also considered the predictions from a statistical mechanical model of DNA binding affinity (See Supplemental Information Section D). As a consequence of performing a second reference purification, we find that fold enrichment should mostly reflect the difference in binding energy between the DNA sequences used in the two purifications, and be much less dependent on whether the protein was in low or high abundance within the cell. This appeared to be the case when considering other <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with LacI copy numbers between about 10 and 1,000 copies per cell (Fig. S5C). Further characterization of the measurement sensitivity and dynamic range of this approach is noted in Supplemental Information Section E.</p>

<title>Sort-Seq discovers regulatory architectures in unannotated regulatory regions</title>
<p>Given that more than half of the promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic> have no annotated transcription factor binding sites in RegulonDB, we narrowed our focus by using several high-throughput studies to identify candidate genes to apply our approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The work by Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) in particular measured the protein copy number of about half the <italic>E. coli</italic> genes across 22 distinct growth conditions. Using this data, we identified genes that had substantial differential gene expression patterns across growth conditions, thus hinting at the presence of regulation and even how that regulation is elicited by environmental conditions (see further details in Supplemental Information Section A and Fig. S2A-C). On the basis of this survey, we chose to investigate the promoters of <italic>purT, xylE,</italic> and <italic>dgoRKADT.</italic> To apply Sort-Seq in a more exploratory manner, we considered three 60 bp mutagenized windows spanning the intergenic region of each gene. While it is certainly possible that regulatory features will lie outside of this window, a search of known regulatory binding sites suggest that this should be sufficient to capture just over 70&#x0025; of regulatory features in <italic>E. coli</italic> and provide a useful starting point (Fig. S6).</p>

<p>For the <italic>yebG</italic> promoter, the features were largely consistent with prior work, containing a binding sites for LexA and RNAP. However, we found that the RNAP binding site is shifted 9 bp downstream from what was identified previously through a computational search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), demonstrating the ability of our approach to identify and correct errors in the published record. We were also able to confirm that the <italic>yebG</italic> promoter was induced in response to DNA damage by repeating Sort-Seq in the presence of mitomycin C (a potent DNA cross-linker known to elicit the SOS response and proteolysis of LexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>); see Fig. S7A, B, and D).</p>
<p>Given the role of <italic>purT</italic> in the synthesis of purines, and the tight control over purine concentrations within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), we performed Sort-Seq of the <italic>purT</italic> promoter in the presence or absence of the purine, adenine, in the growth media. In growth without adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, right plot), we observed two negative regions in the expression shift plot. Through inference of an energy matrix, these two features were identified as the -10 and -35 regions of an RNAP binding site. While these two features were still present upon addition of adenine, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>, this growth condition also revealed a putative repressor site between the -35 and -10 RNAP binding sites, indicated by a positive shift in expression (green annotation).</p>
<p>Following our strategy to find not only the regulatory sequences, but also their associated transcription factors, we next applied DNA affinity chromatography using this putative binding site sequence. In our initial attempt however, we were unable to identify any substantially enriched transcription factor (Fig. S7C). With repression observed only when cells were grown in the presence of adenine, we reasoned that the transcription factor may require a related ligand in order to bind the DNA, possibly through an allosteric mechanism. Importantly, we were able to infer an energy matrix to the putative repressor site whose sequence-specificity matched that of the well-characterized repressor, PurR (r&#x003D;0.82; see Fig. S4). We also noted ChIP-chip data of PurR that suggests it might bind within this intergenic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We therefore repeated the purification in the presence of hypoxanthine, which is a purine derivative that also binds PurR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>, we now observed a substantial enrichment of PurR with this putative binding site sequence. As further validation, we performed Sort-Seq once more in the adenine-rich growth condition, but in a &#x0394;<italic>purR</italic> strain. In the absence of PurR, the putative repressor binding site disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>), which is consistent with PurR binding at this location.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref> we summarize the regulatory features between the coding genes of <italic>purT</italic> and <italic>yebG</italic>, including the new features identified by Sort-Seq. With the appearance of a simple repression architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) for the <italic>purT</italic> promoter, we extended our analysis by developing a thermodynamic model to describe repression by PurR. This enabled us to infer the binding energies of RNAP and PurR in absolute <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), and we show the resulting model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref> (see additional details in Supplemental Information Section Information H.3.4).</p>

<p>The next unannotated promoter we considered was associated with expression of <italic>xylE,</italic> a xylose/proton symporter involved in uptake of xylose. From our analysis of the Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) data, we found that <italic>xylE</italic> was sensitive to xylose and proceeded by performing Sort-Seq in cells grown in this carbon source. Interestingly, the promoter exhibited essentially no expression in other media (Fig. S7E).

</fig>
<p>We applied DNA affinity chromatography using a DNA target containing this entire upstream region. Due to the stringent requirement for xylose to be present for any measurable expression, xylose was supplemented in the lysate during binding with the target DNA. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref> we plot the enrichment ratios from this purification and find XylR to be most significantly enriched. From an energy matrix inferred for the entire region upstream of the RNAP site, we were able to identify two correlated 15 bp regions (dark yellow shaded regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Mutations of the XylR protein have been found to diminish transport of xylose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), which in light of our result, may be due in part to a loss of activation and expression of this xylose/proton symporter. These binding sites were also similar to those found on two other promoters known to be regulated by XylR <italic>(xylA</italic> and <italic>xylF</italic> promoters), whose promoters also exhibit tandem XylR binding sites and strong binding energy predictions with our energy matrix (Fig. S7F).</p>
<p>Within the upstream activator region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref> there still appeared to be a binding site unaccounted for with these tandem XylR binding sites. From the energy matrix, we were further able to identify a binding site for CRP, which is noted upstream of the XylR binding sites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>. While we did not observe a significant enrichment of CRP in our protein purification, the most energetically favorable sequence predicted by our model, TGCGACCNAGATCACA, closely matches the CRP consensus sequence of TGTGANNNNNNTCACA. In contrast to the <italic>lac</italic> promoter, binding by CRP here appears to depend more on the right half of the binding site sequence. CRP is known to activate promoters by multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and CRP binding sites have been found adjacent to the activators XylR and AraC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), in line with our result. While further work will be needed to characterize the specific regulatory mechanism here, it appears that activation of RNAP is mediated by both CRP and XylR and we summarize this result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref> (and considered further in Supplemental Information Section H.3.4).</p>

<title>The dgoRKADT promoter is auto-repressed by DgoR, with transcription mediated by class II activation by CRP</title>
<p>As a final illustration of the approach developed here, we considered the unannotated promoter of <italic>dgoRKADT.</italic> The operon codes for D-galactonate-catabolizing enzymes; D-galactonate is a sugar acid that has been found as a product of galactose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). We began by measuring expression from a non-mutagenized <italic>dgoRKADT</italic> promoter reporter to glucose, galactose, and D-galactonate. Cells grown in galactose exhibited higher expression than in glucose, as found by Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and even higher expression when cells were grown in D-galactonate (Fig. S8A). This likely reflects the physiological role provided by the genes of this promoter, which appear necessary for metabolism of D-galactonate. We therefore proceeded by performing Sort-Seq with cells grown in either glucose or D-galactonate, since these appeared to represent distinct regulatory states, with expression low in glucose and high in D-galactonate.

</fig>
<p>We begin by considering the results from growth in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>, top plot). Here we identified an RNAP binding site between -30 bp and -70 bp, relative to the native start codon for <italic>dgoR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Another distinct feature was a positive expression shift in the region between -140 bp and -110 bp, suggesting the presence of a repressor binding site. Applying DNA affinity chromatography using this target region we observed an enrichment of DgoR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>), suggesting that the promoter is indeed under repression, and regulated by the first coding gene of its transcript. As further validation of binding by DgoR, the positive shift in expression was no longer observed when Sort-Seq was repeated in a &#x0394;<italic>dgoR</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref> and Fig. S8C). We also were able to identify additional RNAP binding sites that were not apparent due to binding by DgoR. While only one RNAP -10 motif is clearly visible in the sequence logo shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref> (top sequence logo; TATAAT consensus sequence), we used simulations to demonstrate that the entire sequence logo shown can be explained by the convolution of three overlapping RNAP binding sites (See Supplemental Information Section D and Fig. S8F).</p>
<p>Next we consider the D-galactonate growth condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>, bottom plot). Like in the expression shift plot for the &#x0394;<italic>dgoR</italic> strain grown in glucose, we no longer observe the positive expression shift between -140 bp and -110 bp. This suggests that DgoR may be induced by D-galactonate or a related metabolite. However, in comparison with the expression shifts in the &#x0394;<italic>dgoR</italic> strain grown in glucose, there were some notable differences in the region between &#x2212;160 bp and &#x2212;140 bp. Here we find evidence for another CRP binding site. The sequence logo identifies the sequence TGTGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>, bottom logo), which matches the left side of the CRP consensus sequence. In contrast to the <italic>lac</italic> and <italic>xylE</italic> promoters however, the right half of the binding site directly overlaps with where we would expect to find a -35 RNAP binding site. This type of interaction by CRP has been previously observed and is defined as class II CRP dependent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), though this sequence-specificity has not been previously described.</p>
<p>In order to isolate and better identify this putative CRP binding site we repeated Sort-Seq in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JK10, grown in 500 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M cAMP. Strain JK10 lacks adenlyate cyclase <italic>(cyaA)</italic> and phosphodiesterase (<italic>cpdA</italic>), which are needed for cAMP synthesis and degradation, respectively, and is thus unable to control intracellular cAMP levels necessary for activation by CRP (derivative of TK310 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>)). Growth in the presence of 500 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M cAMP provided strong induction from the <italic>dgoRKADT</italic> promoter and resulted in a sequence logo at the putative CRP binding site that even more clearly resembled binding by CRP (Fig. S8E). This is likely because expression is now dominated by the CRP activated RNAP binding site. Importantly, this data allowed us to further infer the interaction energy between CRP and RNAP, which we estimate to be -7.3 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> (further detailed in Supplemental Information Section H.3.4). We summarize the identified regulatory features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7E</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have established a systematic procedure for dissecting the functional mechanisms of previously uncharacterized regulatory sequences in bacteria. A massively parallel reporter assay, Sort-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), is used to first elucidate the locations of functional transcription factor binding sites. DNA oligonucleotides containing these binding sites are then used to enrich the cognate transcription factors and identify them by mass spectrometry analysis. Information-based modeling and inference of energy matrices that describe the DNA binding specificity of regulatory factors provide further quantitative insight into transcription factor identity and the growth condition dependent regulatory architectures.</p>
<p>To validate this approach we examined four previously annotated promoters of <italic>lac</italic>, <italic>rel</italic>, <italic>mar</italic>, and <italic>yebG</italic>, with our results consistent with established knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). For the <italic>yebG</italic> promoter, however, our approach corrected an error in a previous annotation. Importantly, we find that DNA affinity chromatography experiments on these promoters were highly sensitive. In particular, LacI was unambiguously identified with the weak O3 binding site, even though LacI is present in only about 10 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Emboldened by this success, we then studied promoters having little or no prior regulatory annotation: <italic>purT, xylE,</italic> and <italic>dgoR.</italic> Here our analysis led to a collection of new regulatory hypotheses. For the <italic>purT</italic> promoter, we identified a simple repression architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), with repression by PurR. The <italic>xylE</italic> promoter was found to undergo activation only when cells are grown in xylose, likely due to allosteric interaction between the activator XylR and xylose, and activation by CRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Finally, in the case of <italic>dgoR</italic>, the base-pair resolution allowed us to tease apart overlapping regulatory binding sites, identify multiple RNAP binding sites along the length of the promoter, and infer further quantitative detail about the interaction between the newly identified binding sites for CRP and RNAP. We view these results as a critical first step in the quantitative dissection of transcriptional regulation, which will ultimately be needed for a predictive understanding of how such regulation works.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the presented approach is that it is readily parallelized and scalable. There are a number of ways to increase the resolution and throughput. Microarray-synthesized promoter libraries should allow multiple loci to be studied simultaneously. Landing pad technologies for chromosomal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) should enable massively parallel reporter assays to be performed in chromosomes instead of on plasmids. Techniques that combine these assays with transcription start site readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) may further allow the molecular regulators of overlapping RNAP binding sites to be deconvolved, or the contributions from separate RNAP binding sites, like those observed on the <italic>dgoR</italic> promoter, to be better distinguished. Although our work was directed toward regulatory regions of <italic>E. coli</italic>, there are no intrinsic limitations that restrict the analysis to this organism. Rather, it should be applicable to any bacterium that supports efficient transformation by plasmids. And although we have focused on bacteria, our general strategy should be feasible in a number of eukaryotic systems &#x2013; including human cell culture &#x2013; using massively parallel reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and DNA-mediated protein pull-down methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) that have already been established.</p>

<p>DNA affinity chromatography was performed by incubating cell lysate with magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne T1, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) containing tethered DNA. The DNA was tethered through a linkage between streptavidin on the beads and biotin on the DNA. Single-stranded DNA was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies with the biotin modification on the 5&#x2019; end of the oligonucleotide sense strand. Cell lysates were incubated on a rotating wheel with the DNA tethered beads overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. Beads were washed three times using lysis buffer and once more with NEB Buffer 3.1 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). Both purifications (with the target DNA and reference control) were combined by resus-pending in 50 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>L NEB Buffer 3.1, and the DNA was cleaved by adding 10 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>l of the restriction enzyme PstI (100,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs targeting a CTGCAG sequence on the DNA) and incubating for 1.5 hours at 25&#x00B0;C. The beads were then removed and the samples prepared for mass spectrometry by in-gel digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C.</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS analysis and protein quantitation</title>
<p>Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) and further detailed in supplemental experimental details. Thermo RAW files were processed using MaxQuant (v. 1.5.3.30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Spectra were searched against the UniProt <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 database (4318 sequences) as well as a contaminant database (256 sequences). Additional details are provided in Supplemental Information Section I.5. To calculate the overall protein ratio, the non-normalized protein replicate ratios were log transformed and then shifted so that the median protein log ratio within each replicate was zero (i.e., the median protein ratio was 1:1). The overall experimental log ratio was then calculated from the average of the replicate ratios.</p>
