<abstract>
<p>The circadian clock interacts with other regulatory pathways to tune physiology to predictable daily changes and unexpected environmental fluctuations. However, the complexity of circadian clocks in higher organisms has prevented a clear understanding of how natural environmental conditions affect circadian clocks and their physiological outputs. Here, we dissect the interaction between circadian regulation and responses to fluctuating light in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic>. We demonstrate that natural changes in light intensity substantially affect the expression of hundreds of circadian-clock-controlled genes, many of which are involved in key steps in metabolism. These changes in expression arise from control of RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters by circadian and light-responsive regulation of a network of transcription factors including RpaA and RpaB. Using phenomenological modeling constrained by our data, we reveal simple principles that underlie the small number of stereotyped responses of dusk circadian genes to changes in light.</p>

<body>
<p>Circadian clocks allow organisms from almost all branches of life to alter physiology in anticipation of diurnal changes in the environment. Circadian clocks keep time using autonomous core oscillators which control output pathways to direct periodic changes in the mRNA levels (expression) of genes, ultimately leading to oscillations in higher order behaviors [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Laboratory studies of the outputs of circadian clocks have been primarily performed under constant conditions to isolate circadian regulation from environmental responses. In nature, however, organisms with circadian clocks must also cope with unexpected fluctuations in the environment. Thus a major challenge in chronobiology is to understand circadian clocks and their outputs in dynamic environments.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggest that circadian clock output pathways interact with environmental responses to tailor physiological outputs to both the time of day and the current state of the environment. For example, sleep/wake cycles in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and photosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are controlled by both the circadian clock and environmental variables like day length or light [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Further, circadian clocks can modulate environmental responses based on the time-of-day in a process called circadian gating [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the complexity of higher organisms has prevented a detailed understanding of the interaction between circadian timing information and environmental responses. In contrast, the circadian clock in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC7942, an obligate photoautotroph, has a simple architecture which controls gene expression oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to influence metabolism and growth. <italic>S. elongatus</italic> must carefully monitor its environment, as the sunlight required for photosynthesis fluctuates on the minute, day, and seasonal timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). While it is well understood how the circadian clock in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> behaves under constant conditions, it is unclear how this system changes in natural, fluctuating light.</p>
<p>Under &#x2018;Constant Light&#x2019; conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dashed navy blue line), genes which show oscillatory expression (circadian genes) can be divided into two groups, the dawn and the dusk genes, which peak at subjective dawn and subjective dusk [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subjective dawn and subjective dusk refer to the times at which dark-to-light or light-to-dark transitions would occur in a 12 hr light-12 hr dark environmental cycle. The dawn genes consist of the core metabolic and growth genes for <italic>S. elongatus</italic>, including the photosystems, ATP synthase, carbon fixation/Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle enzymes and ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the absence of regulation by the circadian clock under Constant Light, <italic>S. elongatus</italic> constantly expresses dawn genes [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The clock primarily regulates the expression of dusk genes [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which include the genes required to utilize glycogen as an energy source in the absence of sunlight, such as glycogen phosphorylase and cytochrome c oxidase. As such, the circadian clock serves a critical function in switching <italic>S. elongatus</italic> from a daytime state of photosynthesis to a nighttime state of carbon metabolism through glycogen breakdown [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Constant Light conditions, the dusk and dawn genes show oscillatory expression with a 24 hr period, resulting in broad peaks of maximal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, solid green line and dashed red line) [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent whole-cell modeling of metabolism, protein levels, and growth predict that this picture of circadian gene expression should change under the dynamic light conditions of a natural, clear day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, navy blue line) [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The modeling suggests that making and using glycogen is a major cost to cell growth and thus the expression of genes required to switch metabolism from photosynthesis to glycogen breakdown should be delayed until absolutely necessary [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, gene expression in natural light conditions has not been measured in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>.</p>
<p>Consistent with predictions of light-dependent changes in circadian gene expression, current evidence suggests interaction between circadian and light regulatory pathways. The cyanobacterial clock keeps track of the time of day using a core post-translational oscillator (PTO) that consists of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, whose enzymatic activities result in 24 hr oscillations in the phosphorylation state of KaiC [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In vivo under Constant Light conditions the Kai PTO modulates circadian gene expression by controlling oscillations in phosphorylation state of the master OmpR-type transcription factor RpaA [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to peak at subjective dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, black dotted line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Phosphorylated RpaA (RpaA&#x223C;P) binds to the promoters of some dusk genes to activate their expression, leading to indirect activation of other dusk genes and repression of dawn genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As <italic>kaiBC</italic> is a dusk gene target of RpaA, the Kai PTO directs its own expression, resulting in a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTL) that stabilizes the phase of the clock [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Exposure to complete darkness at specific times of day causes phase shifts in the PTO to align clock output with the external day/night cycle [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], in a process called entrainment. However, it is not understood whether RpaA activity and the TTL loop change in the presence of more subtle natural light changes during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Meanwhile the OmpR-type transcription factor RpaB binds to some circadian gene promoters [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the phosphorylation state and DNA binding activity of this protein decreases in response to high light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, it is not clear how natural light changes like sunset or shade pulses affect RpaB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, RpaB clearly plays some role in altering circadian gene expression in response to light[<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but it is unclear how (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While light likely exerts global, growth-rate-dependent regulation [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the interaction between circadian and light regulation to control the activities of RpaA and RpaB represents a particularly tractable scenario for dissecting the mechanisms underlying interaction between clock and environment to control physiology.</p>
<p>Here we measure and model circadian gene expression and several layers of regulation in cyanobacteria grown under the fluctuating light intensities typically experienced in nature. We find that fluctuations in light alter the expression patterns of almost all circadian genes. We identify key regulatory steps at which information about changes in light interact with clock output pathways to control gene expression, and reveal a complex regulatory network underlying circadian gene expression in natural conditions. Finally, we show that phenomenological models effectively describe the integration of the circadian clock with responses to environmental fluctuations.</p>

<title>Sunlight on a clear day delays the timing of circadian gene expression relative to constant light conditions</title>
<p>To grow and assay cyanobacteria in natural light conditions, we custom-built a culturing setup with a light source that can be programmed to mimic natural fluctuations in sunlight. On a cloudless &#x2018;Clear Day,&#x2019; light intensity varies in a parabolic manner due to the rotation of the Earth, ending with a gradual ramp down of light intensity prior to dusk (&#x2018;Sunset&#x2019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Rapid changes in cloud cover cause abrupt increases (&#x2018;High Light pulse&#x2019;) and decreases (&#x2018;Shade pulse&#x2019;) in sunlight [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using a set of programmable warm white LED arrays (Materials and Methods, Construction of light apparatus and Calibrating light conditions) for illumination, in all experiments we grew cells in either a Clear Day that peaked at 600 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> or a constant Low Light of 50 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top panel) for at least two days to acclimate and synchronize the cells before measurement.</p>
<p>To determine whether a natural light profile affects circadian output, we compared genome-wide gene expression in Clear Day conditions versus Low Light conditions using RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Setup, arrows indicate sampling). We maintained cultures in their respective condition followed by 12 hours of darkness for 3 light/dark cycles, and sampled them (arrows) over the third light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Setup). Growth in Clear Day conditions affected pigment levels and growth rate compared to Low light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). We focused our analysis on a set of high amplitude circadian genes that show oscillatory expression under Constant Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>; see Materials and Methods, Definition of circadian genes). The Low Light condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel) reproduces the expression profile previously observed under Constant Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in the Clear Day condition 148 of the 281 dusk genes were expressed two fold or higher at dusk compared to Low Light, demonstrating light-dependent expression. Dawn genes show the opposite behavior &#x2014; they have higher expression at midday under Clear Day conditions, although this trend is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, Clear Day conditions significantly influence the expression dynamics of almost all circadian genes, with the strongest effects on dusk genes.</p>
<p>To look more closely at how the Clear Day condition affects the dusk genes, which are the primary regulatory targets of the clock, we analyze the gene expression dynamics of the representative dusk gene <italic>Synpcc7942 1567</italic>. Under Low Light conditions, <italic>Synpcc7942 1567</italic> exhibits an increase in expression from dawn to dusk, reaching a plateau by 8 hours after dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, black solid line). Under Clear Day conditions, however, the expression of this gene remains low through the midday peak of light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, magenta solid line; 4-8 hours after dawn), and its expression sharply increases just prior to dusk as light intensity decreases, reaching maximal expression just as the 12 hour dark period begins. This delayed pattern of gene expression can be seen in almost all dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>Synpcc7942 1567</italic> indicated with arrows). Thus Clear Day conditions significantly alter the dynamics and amplitude of dusk gene expression to peak just before dusk.</p>

<p>The delay of dusk gene expression likely enables cyanobacteria to switch to inefficient energy production by glycogen breakdown only when absolutely necessary so that they can survive the extended darkness of night. The two glycogen breakdown genes, <italic>glgP</italic> and <italic>glgX</italic>, are both light-dependent dusk genes that strongly peak in Clear Day at dusk, while <italic>glgC</italic>, which codes for the rate limiting enzyme of glycogen synthesis, is a dawn gene whose expression is higher in Clear Day conditions compared to Low Light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S4">Figure 2-figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>These gene expression dynamics would favor both the maintenance of glycogen synthesis until the end of the day and a delay in the activation of glycogen breakdown until just before it is required at nighttime, in agreement with predictions from metabolic modeling during the same Clear Day conditions used here [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, environmental conditions are integrated into the output of the circadian clock to potentially optimize resource allocation in naturally-relevant diurnal cycles, as recently suggested [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Remarkably, though in both light conditions the cells experience 50 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at the end of the day just before night, light-dependent dusk genes have substantially higher expression in the Clear Day conditions relative to the Low Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). This strong activation of dusk genes occurs concomitant with the decrease in light intensity during Clear Day that mimics Sunset, which suggests that <italic>changes</italic> in light intensity affect activation of dusk genes, as opposed to absolute light intensity levels. Dusk gene expression could thus happen &#x2018;just-in-time&#x2019; before night regardless of when Sunset occurs.</p>

<title>Changes in light intensity control the transcription of circadian genes</title>
<p>We next asked whether changes in light intensity are a factor controlling the expression of circadian genes. To directly probe how changes in light affect dusk gene expression, we exposed cells to a High Light pulse or a Shade pulse and measured genome-wide gene expression using RNA sequencing. We grew cultures in either Low Light or Clear Day conditions for three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>, Setup). On the fourth day, 8 hours after dawn, when RpaA is most active, we exposed the cells to a High Light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or a Shade pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) for 1 hour before returning to the original condition, and sampled them before, during, and after the perturbation. The expression of dusk genes rapidly changed in a direction opposite to the change in light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, all dusk genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, example dusk gene; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, all dusk genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, example dusk gene), as expected from the effects of the decrease in light intensity at Sunset of the Clear Day condition on circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>). When cultures were restored to their original condition (High Light to Low Light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>,E; Shade to Clear Day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>,F), dusk gene expression quickly reverted to a level comparable to that before the pulse. Thus, light-induced changes in dusk gene expression are reversible and responsive to successive shifts in light availability. Dawn gene expression showed the opposite behavior of dusk genes, albeit with less dramatic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, decreases in light intensity favor the expression of dusk genes (Sunset in Clear Day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; Clear Day to Shade and High Light to Low Light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), while increases in light favor the expression of dawn genes (midday peak in Clear Day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>; Shade to Clear Day and Low Light to High Light, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-figure supplement1</xref>). Given the more substantial effects of light on dusk gene expression, we focus our further analysis on these genes. To cause these reversible changes in the mRNA levels of dusk genes, changes in light intensity must affect the either the transcription or degradation of dusk gene mRNAs.</p>
<p>To determine whether changes in light intensity regulate the recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to dusk gene promoters, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIPseq) of RNAP in cells immediately before the High Light or Shade pulse (8 hours after dawn in Low Light or Clear Day), and then again after 15 or 60 minutes during the pulse. RNAP enrichment decreased upstream of dusk genes after exposure to High Light, while RNAP enrichment increased after exposure to Shade, correlating with changes in downstream dusk gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>,H; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, changes in light affect RNAP recruitment to dusk gene promoters, suggesting that light conditions affect dusk gene mRNA levels primarily by regulating rates of transcription. These results point to a potential interaction between sunlight and signaling pathways upstream of RNAP. We next explored how the observed changes in dusk gene expression in the presence of natural light fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) could be achieved via gene regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<title>Regulation of dusk gene expression by RpaA and RpaB under dynamic light regimes</title>
<p>We first assessed whether changes in light intensity affect RpaA activity to regulate the recruitment of RNAP to dusk genes. Levels of RpaA&#x223C;P increased from dawn to dusk similarly in cells grown in either Low Light or Clear Day conditions, and abrupt changes in light intensity did not affect these dynamics. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>,B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, these natural light fluctuations do not affect the phase of the Kai PTO nor the control of RpaA&#x223C;P levels by the Kai PTO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and thus do not serve as entrainment signals to the clock. However, ChIP-seq showed that light intensity fluctuations alter RpaA&#x223C;P binding upstream of dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>) in conjunction with RNAP binding upstream of the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3">Figure 4-figure supplement 3</xref>). The binding of RpaA&#x223C;P and RNAP correlated with changes in downstream dusk gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, light fluctuations control the binding of RpaA&#x223C;P and RNAP to promoters, suggesting that light-induced changes in the binding of these factors may modulate the activation of dusk gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, RpaA regulation at a small number (&#x223C;10) of promoters including that of <italic>kaiBC</italic> is not substantially affected by light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>,D - points around origin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S4">Figure 4-figure supplement 4</xref>), demonstrating that the light-dependent regulation of RpaA binding is locus-specific. The KaiABC clock regulates RpaA&#x223C;P levels independent of changes in light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>,B), and <italic>kaiBC</italic> gene expression dynamics do not substantially change in the Clear Day conditions compared to the Low Light condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S4">Figure 4-figure supplement 4H-K</xref>). Hence, the stabilizing PTO/TTL circadian circuit is robust to natural fluctuations in sunlight. The circadian clock can thus control gene expression independent of environmental changes at select promoters. It is possible that RpaA&#x223C;P binding to some promoters is dependent on the association of RNAP with that promoter. As such, regulation that affects RNAP binding to a specific promoter, such as that by sigma factor activity [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], could affect RpaA&#x223C;P binding to select promoters.</p>
<p>We next asked whether RpaB plays a role in controlling light-dependent expression of circadian genes. We observed that levels of RpaB&#x223C;P changed rapidly in a direction opposite to the change in light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>,B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S1">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that light affects RpaB activity through its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Using ChIP-seq, we found that RpaB binds upstream of a large subset of dusk genes (42/281 dusk genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>-source data 2). RpaB binding upstream of these genes shifts after rapid changes in light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>), correlating with changes in RpaB&#x223C;P levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>,B), RNAP binding upstream of the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S3">Figure 5-figure supplement3</xref>), and downstream dusk gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that RpaB&#x223C;P directly activates the expression of many dusk genes by binding to promoters with RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, changes in sunlight can regulate dusk genes by adjusting RpaB&#x223C;P levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>

<p>Because RpaA and RpaB bind only a subset of light-responsive dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>,B), additional factors must be involved in controlling light-responsive dusk gene expression. Sigma factors are sequence-specific RNAP subunits which regulate gene expression in bacteria [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Interestingly, RpaA, RpaB, and RNAP bind to the promoters of three sigma factor genes after abrupt changes in light intensity, correlating with light-responsive changes in expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>,D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). These sigma factor genes show light-dependent dusk gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1G-L</xref>) that mirror those of the larger group of dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), suggesting that these sigma factors could regulate the expression of other dusk genes. Thus, RpaA and RpaB may indirectly regulate the expression of non-target dusk genes by controlling the circadian and light-responsive expression of sigma factor genes [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], similar to how RpaA drives all dusk gene expression in Constant Light conditions by binding to a subset of dusk genes [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given that secondary transcriptional regulators like sigma factors can be regulated post-transcriptionally [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], it is also possible that changes in light intensity affect the activity of dusk transcriptional regulators in a manner independent of RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P regulation. Further, global growth-rate-dependent gene regulatory mechanisms [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] likely cause some of the light-dependent changes in circadian gene expression due to unavoidable differences in the growth rate in different light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We have defined a regulatory picture in which changes in light intensity affect the activity of RpaA and RpaB to control the expression of dusk genes. However, light affects RpaA activity in complex and promoter-specific ways. Additionally, light-dependent regulation in addition to that mediated by RpaA and RpaB may control dusk gene expression in response to environmental perturbations. Still, despite the apparent complexity of regulation of dusk genes in response to light fluctuations, the expression of almost all dusk genes show strikingly regular dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>,3). Further, the activity of RpaA and RpaB at a subset of promoters (especially those of sigma factor genes) could lead to pervasive and coordinated changes in the expression of other dusk genes. Hence, we reasoned that mathematical models [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] of RpaA and RpaB activity might effectively describe the regulatory circuits underlying the dynamics of large groups of dusk genes. Such an approach would enable an understanding of the basic principles of interaction between circadian gene expression regulation with light-dependent regulation without needing to describe all underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

<title>Phenomenological models suggest simple principles underlying the activation of clusters of light-responsive dusk genes</title>
<p>We find that dusk genes collectively display a small number of responses to changes in environmental light intensity. Using k-means clustering of the gene expression dynamics from our different light profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), as well as from perturbations of RpaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref> [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), we identify three major groups of dusk genes (35-80 genes, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>-source data 1 for full lists) which show distinct and coordinated changes in gene expression over circadian time and in response to changes in light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S1">Figure 7-figure supplement 1</xref>). Under Constant Light conditions, all three clusters are activated by RpaA&#x223C;P but display distinct activation dynamics from dawn to dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S1">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>) that are mirrored under our Low Light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S1">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref>). We named the clusters the Early, Middle, and Late dusk genes based on the order of activation.</p>
<p>The Shade pulse and Sunset in the Clear Day condition have differing effects on the expression of each of the major dusk gene clusters. Early dusk gene expression rapidly increases in response to Shade, but during Sunset plateaus at &#x223C;1/2 of the maximal gene expression reached in Shade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> - left plot). Conversely, the Late gene cluster responds most strongly to Sunset in Clear Day conditions but has a mild increase in expression in Shade relative to the Early and Middle dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> - right plot). In contrast, the Middle gene cluster is induced to a similar magnitude by both Shade and Sunset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> - middle plot). Shade and Sunset represent similar light changes that occur at different times of day (afternoon and dusk, respectively). As such, the Early and Late dusk gene clusters are differentially induced by a decrease in light intensity depending on the time of day in which it occurs. This circadian effect on the intensity and dynamics of a response to environmental change is a signature of circadian gating [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Though circadian gating has been observed (e.g., [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) and modeled without any knowledge of the transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in plants, it remains unclear what gene regulatory circuits are sufficient to explain such behavior.</p>
<p>At present, there is no mechanistic model to explain the differences in response of these clusters to circadian regulation or changes in sunlight. Given that there are unknown regulators involved in circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>,B), and because it is not possible to exhaustively test all possible models of regulation of dusk gene expression, we sought to construct the simplest models that can describe the expression dynamics of these clusters using a phenomenological modeling approach. Such models can be used to highlight regulatory architectures and molecular principles that are sufficient to recapitulate the observed gene expression dynamics, as well as direct further mechanistic studies to reveal the underlying molecular details of gene expression regulation.</p>
<p>Given the clear roles for RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P in activating dusk genes, we asked whether the dynamic expression of the major dusk gene clusters in naturally-relevant light conditions could be described by these variables. We constructed phenomenological models that describe the kinetics of the synthesis and breakdown of an average gene in each of the dusk gene clusters [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (see Materials and Methods, Mathematical modeling). The rate of synthesis was the sum of a baseline rate of transcription and a maximal adjustable rate of transcription that could be modulated by the activity of one or more regulators. We described the the effects of a regulator such as RpaA&#x223C;P or RpaB&#x223C;P using a Hill function, whose shape is determined by the Hill coefficient and the coefficient of activation. We determined how well a model could describe the dynamics of a cluster by fitting it to the Clear Day and Shade pulse data and assuming all parameters could vary freely (see Materials and Methods, Mathematical modeling; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>We began by asking whether the activity of RpaA and/or RpaB can describe the gene expression dynamics of the major dusk clusters in natural light conditions. We first constructed models in which dusk cluster gene expression is solely dependent on RpaA&#x223C;P. Activation by RpaA&#x223C;P can recapitulate the ordered activation of the dusk gene clusters through differential coefficients of activation for RpaA&#x223C;P, but cannot describe the light-responsive expression of these genes (RpaA-only models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>). Further, activation by RpaB&#x223C;P alone cannot describe the dusk gene expression patterns of the clusters (RpaB-only models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S2">Figure 7-figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>). However, models in which dusk gene expression is a function of BOTH RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P can recapitulate much of the time-of-day and light intensity dependent expression of the Early and Late clusters and nearly all of the expression dynamics of the Middle clusters (RpaA and RpaB models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>). This suggests that RpaB&#x223C;P is a variable which can capture the effects of dynamic light conditions on RpaA&#x223C;P activity. The fit parameters for simple joint activation can accommodate indirect activation through the sigma factors and thus do not require direct RpaA/B binding to all genes. Conceptually, our results suggest that transcription factors whose activity track the measured dynamics of both RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P can describe the circadian and light-responsive expression of dusk genes. However, joint activation by RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P predicts that the Early and Late clusters will respond similarly to Shade and Sunset in Clear Day conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> - left and right plots), and thus cannot capture well the circadian gating of these clusters.</p>

<p>We reasoned that additional regulatory interactions downstream of RpaA and RpaB, or &#x2018;network motifs&#x2019; [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], could account for the observed gating of the Early and Late clusters. Thus, we constructed models in which dusk cluster gene expression is positively or negatively dependent on the expression of another cluster alongside activation by RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P (Feedback models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>,I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S3">Figure 7-figure supplements 3-5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>). Interestingly, the gating of the Early cluster is recapitulated by a model incorporating an incoherent feedforward loop in which the Late cluster represses Early cluster expression downstream of RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, left plot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S3">Figure 7-figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>). Further, the gating of the Late cluster is well described by a coherent feedforward loop in which Late cluster expression is dependent on RpaA&#x223C;P, RpaB&#x223C;P, AND Middle cluster expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, right plot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S5">Figure 7-figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>).

<p>Our results highlight that the measured dynamics of RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P can describe the dynamics of large groups of clock-controlled genes after environmental changes and suggest regulatory schemes that can diversify gene expression responses downstream of RpaA and RpaB. The models suggested here offer constraints and testable hypotheses to guide future studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses.</p>

<title>Changes in light adjust circadian gene expression to optimize metabolic changes in response to unexpected and daily changes in light intensity</title>
<p>We show that natural fluctuations in light intensity significantly affect the dynamics of circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>,3). While previous studies have measured genome-wide gene expression in a single natural light condition [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], here we compare genome-wide circadian gene expression in several physiologically-relevant conditions, including Clear Day, High Light pulse, Shade pulse, and Low Light, to carefully dissect the effects of light on clock output. Natural light changes most greatly affected a large fraction of the dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and 3C,D), possibly because most of the direct targets of RpaA are dusk genes [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We speculate that the opposing trends we observe in dawn gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>) may in part be due to competition for RNAP between the dusk and dawn genes [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or by growth-rate-dependent mechanisms [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as this group of genes contains the primary growth genes. A systematic exploration of the effects of light on circadian genes will be necessary to fully elaborate the contributions of light, clock, and growth rate on circadian gene dynamics.</p>
<p>We find that large groups of light-responsive dusk genes are activated by diminished light conditions to different extents depending on the time of day the stimulus is applied, potentially to optimally change metabolism for a given light condition and time of day. The light-responsive dusk genes grouped into three clusters - Early, Middle, and Late - with different activation dynamics during Sunset at the end of the Clear Day versus the Shade pulse in the afternoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>-source data 1 for full lists of genes in each cluster). Glycogen breakdown genes and the central carbon metabolism genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and oxalate decarboxylase belong to the Middle dusk genes, which are activated to similar levels by Shade and Sunset. This suggests that cyanobacteria delay the activation of inefficient glycogen breakdown pathways [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] until just before dusk when grown under Clear Day conditions, but can transiently activate these genes in response to Shade to access alternate energy reserves if necessary. Interestingly, genes encoding pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, which reversibly converts NADH to the NADPH required for electron transport [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], belong to the Late cluster and are strongly activated only by Sunset and not afternoon Shade. Such a response might allow the delay the adjustment of the relative levels of NADH/NADPH until only when absolutely needed. The cytochrome c oxidase genes belong to the Early cluster, which respond more intensely to Shade than to Sunset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This enzyme is essential for preventing photodamage in response to rapid changes in light intensity [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; such changes are not expected to occur during the night, where it serves solely as the terminal electron acceptor for respiration. More generally, the genome-wide gene expression dynamics measured here qualitatively agree with predictions from a whole-cell model of <italic>S. elongatus</italic> that assumed optimization of growth [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To resolve how the circadian and light-dependent transcriptional changes effect these metabolic changes, future studies must measure enzyme levels and metabolic fluxes under fluctuating light conditions.</p>

<title>Mechanistic principles underlying the activation of light-responsive dusk genes</title>
<p>While light does not alter the PTO/TTL circadian circuit, it regulates the activation of dusk genes via RpaA&#x223C;P promoter binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and RpaB promoter binding through its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) at a subset of dusk genes. RpaA binding upstream of its target genes under dynamic light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) correlates with the changes in expression of non-RpaA target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, RpaA&#x223C;P may remain the &#x2018;master regulator&#x2019; of circadian gene expression whose promoter binding activity is altered by other molecular factors that encode information about the environment, such as RpaB. Previous work suggested that changes in RpaB&#x223C;P phosphorylation would alter RpaA&#x223C;P levels through competition with the enzymes that control RpaA&#x223C;P levels [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, we find that RpaA&#x223C;P levels remain constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>,B) under conditions in which RpaB&#x223C;P levels change substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>,B), arguing that RpaB&#x223C;P does not influence RpaA&#x223C;P levels. RpaB&#x223C;P might influence RpaA&#x223C;P binding at promoters where both proteins bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>) as previously suggested [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and joint control of sigma factors by RpaA and RpaB could feedback to affect RpaA binding at select promoters. Still, the question of how light changes RpaA&#x223C;P binding in a promoter-specific way remains unclear.</p>
<p>We define a clear role for the stress-responsive transcription factor RpaB as a transcriptional activator of a large subset of dusk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Further, we demonstrate that decreases in light intensity like a Shade Pulse lead to increases in RpaB&#x223C;P levels to allow RpaB to activate the expression of genes, showing that RpaB acts in scenarios beyond its previously appreciated role in High Light stress [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P might cooperate to indirectly regulate the expression of most light-responsive dusk genes by jointly controlling the expression levels of multiple sigma factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>) [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, our attempts to cleanly perturb RpaB activity to further explore its role as a regulator of dusk genes were unsuccessful, in part because the <italic>rpaB</italic> gene is essential [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The role of sigma factors in this network of regulation, while strongly implied, remains ambiguous and attempts to assess this role using genetic deletion of sigma factors yielded inconclusive results. More subtle approaches such as anchors away [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] might allow perturbation experiments that clearly explicate the roles of the sigma factors and RpaB in mediating circadian gene expression.</p>
<p>Although complex molecular mechanisms underlie the light-responsive expression of dusk genes, we demonstrate that phenomenological models effectively describe the differential activation of large groups of dusk genes to afternoon Shade and Sunset. These models suggest that transcription factors with the dynamics of RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>,E) are sufficient to reproduce much of the activation of the Early, Middle, and Late clusters in response to a Shade pulse in the afternoon or Sunset just before night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Our models suggest that additional feedback from the other gene clusters may be necessary to achieve the extent of circadian gating observed for the Early and Late clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Our models suggest that interactions between the major dusk clusters can diversify the responses of these clusters to signals from RpaA and RpaB. Regulatory interactions between the sigma factors RpoD6, RpoD5, and SigF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6S1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>), which belong to the Early, Middle, and Late clusters, respectively, could generate feedback downstream of RpaA and RpaB similar to that in our models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S3">Figure 7-figure supplements 3-5</xref>) to generate the diverse responses of the dusk clusters to light conditions. However, feedback could also come from other sources with similar dynamics to the cluster expression levels. Indeed we could not simultaneously fit our models to all four light conditions, likely because of global growth-rate-dependent differences between the Low light and Clear Day conditions. Thus, complete modeling of transcription dynamics of light-dependent dusk genes likely requires explicitly including the effects of metabolism and growth on gene expression [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

<title>Closing remarks</title>
<p>RpaB and its cognate upstream histidine kinase NblS[<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have been implicated in a variety of stress responses [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which suggests that the mechanisms and regulatory circuits defined here may apply to other environmental changes such as temperature or osmolarity. The requirement of RpaB for mediating the environmental response of circadian genes suggests that the circadian circuit coevolved with RpaB to optimize responses to predictable and unpredictable changes in the environment and motivates the further exploration of the interaction between light and circadian rhythms in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>. Resolution of this interaction and subsequent integration into whole cell models of cyanobacterial growth [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] will help to explain the fitness benefits of the circadian clock [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and optimize synthetic biology efforts to engineer cyanobacteria to produce useful compounds[<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] from the constantly changing sunlight in nature.</p>

A downstream kanamycin resistance cassette was used for selection. This plasmid is available through Addgene with the ID 102337. Two different clones of this strain, EOC398 and EOC399, were confirmed by sequencing colony PCR fragments that amplified the modified regions of the gene, and the presence of the tagged subunit was confirmed with Western blotting.</p>

<title>Construction of light apparatus</title>
<p>To grow the cyanobacteria in different light profiles, we constructed an apparatus to control the intensity of four high powered LED arrays (parts list in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>, p. 21). &#x2018;Warm white&#x2019; LED arrays (&#x223C;1 in. x 1 in., Bridgelux) were chosen because of maximal overlap with the phycobili-some absorption spectrum. An LED array was mounted on a heatsink (Nuventix) and powered by a Flexblock LED driver (LEDdynamics) wired in the &#x2018;boost only&#x2019; configuration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>, p. 21). The intensity of the LEDs was controlled by varying the voltage input into the DIM line of the Flexblock between 0 and 10 V. We used a digital potentiometer (AD7376, Analog Devices) as a controllable 10 V source. The voltage output of the digipot was controlled via serial peripheral interface with an Arduino Uno board (Arduino) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Table S3</xref>, 23). Each LED array was controlled separately, and a single array was sufficient to grow a single 750 mL culture of <italic>S. elongatus</italic>. All wires carrying substantial currents from the main power supply to the LED arrays were rated 18 AWG, and all other wires were rated 22 AWG. The relatively low voltage of the main power supply (18 V) is essential for being able to turn off the LED arrays completely.</p>

<title>Calibrating light conditions</title>
<p>A single LED was mounted to shine perpendicular to the ground and isolated from other light sources. A single 750 mL cyanobacterial culture in a 150 cm<sup>2</sup> BD Falcon Tissue culture flask (Fisher Scientific) was placed beneath the LED, tilted such that the broad face of the culture was almost perpendicular to the incoming light. Each LED was calibrated by passing a known voltage input to the LEDs and recording the intensity of the light in <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;</sup>2 s<sup>&#x2212;</sup>1 at the position of the surface of the culture directly beneath the LED using a LI-COR LI-250A light meter equipped a quantum sensor. To access a greater dynamic range of light intensity values, we calibrated the lights to give light intensity values at either of two distances from the light source &#x2014; raised towards the lights to access higher light intensities, or lowered away from the lights to access lower light intensities.</p>
<p>To define the Clear Day conditions, we used light intensity values measured by the Ground-based Atmospheric Monitoring Instrument Suite, Rooftop Instrument Group on March 23rd, 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, dark blue line, [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). We used this light intensity profile to define the rate of change of light intensity in our Clear Day condition, with a maximal light intensity of 600 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This intensity is consistent with measurements of light intensity in aquatic environments [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], while also offering an order of magnitude difference in intensity compared to the Low Light condition, which was a constant 50 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The Shade pulse condition was defined by dividing the intensity value of our Clear Day profile by 10 fold between 8 and 9 hours after dawn. The High Light pulse was defined as the intensity of the Clear Day condition between 8 and 9 hours after dawn. Low Light cultures were grown continuously at 50 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>mol photons m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. We generated the dynamic changes in light intensity of our conditions by changing the intensity of the LED every three minutes by passing the calibrated voltage value corresponding to the appropriate light intensity of our defined profile. After the 12-h light profile, the LEDs were turned off for 12 hours during the dark period. Cultures were grown semi-turbidostatically (OD<sub>750</sub> maintained at 0.3) with periodic dilution in BG-11M media supplemented with 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0 at 30 &#x00B0;C,continuously bubbled with 1&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> in air, and shaken at 25 rpm in an enclosure impermeable to room lighting.

The data plotted in this work are from replicate 2, and the trends observed are reproduced in both biological replicates.</p>

<title>Definition of circadian genes</title>
<p>We defined a subset of previously identified circadian genes on which to focus our analysis. We began with a list of 856 previously described reproducibly circadian genes [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We next required that these genes have a Cosiner amplitude [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] of greater that 0.15 under Constant Light conditions [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We also required that the gene display expression of at least 1 read per nucleotide in at least one time point of the RNA sequencing experiments in this study. These filters produce a list of 450 high confidence circadian genes.</p>
<p>We noted that genes classified as dawn (class 2) and dusk (class 1) genes under Constant Light conditions [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed maximal expression at a different time of day under our Low Light conditions, while the relative ordering of genes by Cosiner phase [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] from Constant Light conditions [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]was preserved. As such, we redefined dawn genes as those genes with a phase of 40&#x00B0; to 189&#x00B0; under Constant Light conditions [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and dusk genes as those with a phase of 190&#x00B0; to 360&#x00B0; and 0&#x00B0; to 39&#x00B0;, as determined by the Cosiner algorithm [<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These definitions produce a list of 169 high confidence dawn genes, and 281 high confidence dusk genes. The expression of our redefined circadian genes under Constant Light conditions is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>.

<p>One hundred and twenty mL of OD<sub>750</sub> 0.3 cyanobacterial culture were removed and crosslinked with 1&#x0025; formaldehyde at 30 &#x00B0;C for 5 minutes in front of a light source.

<p>For a given pulldown, 800 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g of lysate was incubated overnight at 4 <sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C in 500 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>L of lysis buffer with 8 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g of anti-RpaA, anti-RpaB, or FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for RNAP pulldowns.

<p>Sequencing libraries were prepared from the purified ChIP DNA using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Laboratory, Ipswich, MA). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrumentby the by the Bauer Core Facility at the Harvard FAS Center for Systems Biology. We created sequencing libraries of ChIP experiments from two separate biological repeats of the time course experiment. Reads were aligned to the <italic>S. elongatus</italic> genome as described previously [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], resulting in an average of 3 million aligned reads for replicate 1, and 5 million aligned reads for replicate 2.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq analysis</title>
<p>The aligned read data per genomic position was smoothed with a Gaussian filter (window size &#x003D; 400 base pairs, standard deviation &#x003D; 50). Each data set was normalized to the Mock ChIP-seq experiment and peaks which were significantly enriched above the Mock were identified in each data set using a previously described[<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] custom-coded form of the Peak-seq algorithm [<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Within each replicate time course for a given protein, we compiled a list of peaks which were enriched at least 3.5 fold over the Mock experiment at the position of highest ChIP signal. Finally, we required that a peak be detected in both replicates for it to be considered. This analysis generated 114 RpaA peaks, 218 RpaB peaks, and 451 RNAP peaks. To calculate enrichment for a peak, we determined the ChIP signal at a given time point at the genomic position of the highest ChIP signal detected for that peak and divided this by the value of the Mock experiment at that position. The data plotted in this manuscript are from replicate 2, but all trends hold in replicate 1. We assigned a gene as a target of a peak if: i) the start codon of the gene was within 500 bp of the position of maximal ChIP signal within a peak; ii) the peak resided upstream of the gene; iii) The gene was the closest gene to that peak on the same strand. Lists of RNAP, RpaA, and RpaB peaks and gene targets are found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>-source data 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-source data 2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>-source data 2, respectively.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, 3C, and 4C, we identified all RNAP, RpaA, or RpaB peaks with dusk gene targets based on the above criteria, respectively. 82 dusk genes are targets of RNAP peaks, 56 dusk genes were targets of RpaA peaks, and 42 dusk genes are targets of RpaB peaks. Then, for each peak - dusk gene pair, we calculated the change in gene expression of the dusk gene after 60 minutes, and the change in ChIP enrichment of the upstream peak over the mock pulldown (described above) after 60 minutes in High light, each compared to their respective values at Low light at 8 hours since dawn. We plotted these data on the x- and y-axes, respectively, with orange triangles. We repeated this process, comparing gene expression and ChIP enrichment values after 60 minutes in Shade compared to 8 hours since dawn in Clear Day conditions, and plotted the data as gray circles. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the change in gene expression and the change in ChIP enrichment for all peak-gene pairs of the relevant factor in the High Light pulse, and then calculated the same correlation in Shade pulse conditions separately. We calculated the correlation coefficients comparing changes after 15 minutes in either the High Light or Shade pulse conditions, and list these values in the legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>.

<p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S2">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>, we took the lists of RNAP/RpaA/RpaB peaks with dusk gene targets from above. For each peak - gene pair, we calculated the log<sub>2</sub> fold change in ChIP enrichment of the peak and the change in expression of the downstream gene in 15 or 60 minutes in the High Light pulse compared to the value at 8 hours since dawn in Low Light conditions. We repeated these calculations for each peak-gene pair in 15 or 60 minutes in Shade pulse compared to 8 hours since dawn in Clear Day conditions. We used hierarchical clustering on the collective ChIP and gene expression data from both conditions to determine the plotting order of the peak-gene pairs in the heat maps, and then plotted the log<sub>2</sub> change in ChIP enrichment and dusk target gene expression in the two conditions in separate heat maps. The change in enrichment of a peak and the change in expression of its target dusk gene are aligned horizontally in their respective heat maps. The leftmost column of each heat map is white, because this column compares the time 0 data to itself and thus has a log<sub>2</sub> value of 0. One RpaA peak resides upstream of two dusk genes, and two RpaB peaks reside upstream of two dusk genes each, and thus the listed number of RpaA and RpaB peaks is smaller than the number of RpaA and RpaB target dusk genes. The data used for these plots for RNAP, RpaA, and RpaB are available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-source data 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-source data 2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>-source data 2, respectively.

<p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and 5D we identified all dusk genes that were targets of both RpaA and RNAP (for figure 5D) or both RpaB and RNAP (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). 33 dusk genes are targets of both RpaA and RNAP peaks, and 27 dusk genes are targets of both RpaB and RNAP. Then, for each pair of RpaA/B - RNAP peaks, we calculated the change in ChIP enrichment of the RpaA/B peak after 60 minutes, and the change in ChIP enrichment of the RNAP peak upstream of the same dusk gene over the mock pulldown (described above) after 60 minutes in High light, each compared to their respective values at Low light at 8 hours since dawn. We plotted these data on the x- and y-axes, respectively, with orange triangles. We repeated this process, comparing RpaA/B ChIP enrichment and RNAP ChIP enrichment values after 60 minutes in Shade compared to 8 hours since dawn in Clear Day conditions, and plotted the data as gray circles. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the change in RpaA/B ChIP enrichment and the change in RNAP ChIP enrichment for all RpaA/B - RNAP peak pairs of the relevant factor in the High Light pulse, and then calculated the same correlation in Shade pulse conditions separately. We calculated the correlation coeffi-cients comparing changes after 15 minutes in either the High Light or Shade pulse conditions, and list these values in the legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3">Figure 4-figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5S3">Figure 5-figure supplement 3</xref>.

For each RpaA/B - RNAP peak, we calculated the log<sub>2</sub> fold change in ChIP enrichment of the RpaA/B peak and the change in ChIP enrichment of the RNAP peak upstream of the same dusk gene in 15 or 60 minutes in the High Light pulse compared to the value at 8 hours since dawn in Low Light conditions. We repeated these calculations for each peak-gene pair in 15 or 60 minutes in Shade pulse compared to 8 hours since dawn in Clear Day conditions. We used hierarchical clustering on the collective RpaA/B and RNAP ChIP data from both conditions to determine the plotting order of the RpaA/RpaB - RNAP peak pairs in the heat maps, and then plotted the log<sub>2</sub> change in RpaA/B ChIP enrichment and RNAP ChIP enrichment in the two conditions in separate heat maps.

<title>K-means clustering</title>
<p>We calculated normalized expression values of high confidence dusk genes under our dynamic light conditions, as well as in previously described RpaA perturbations in Constant Light [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We separately normalized the data from set of dynamic light conditions (Low Light, Clear Day, High Light pulse, Shade pulse) and the Constant Light data (Wildtype, OX-D53E cells &#x2014; <italic>rpaA-</italic>, <italic>kaiBC-</italic>, <italic>Ptrc::rpaA(D53E)</italic> &#x2014; without inducer, OX-D53E with inducer) using z-score normalization, and used this data to separate the dusk genes into 8 groups with k-means clustering using Pearson correlation as the distance metric. We focused our analysis on the three largest clusters which accounted for most of the dusk genes (187/281 genes). The lists of genes belonging the three major clusters are found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>-source data 1.</p>

<title>Mathematical modeling</title>
<p>We observed very regular and systematic changes in the expression of large clusters of dusk genes in natural light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>) that correlated with RpaA/B recruitment of RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Thus, our goal was to determine whether simple phenomenological models similar to that inspired by Alon[<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] could reproduce these observations and offer some intuition into how they might arise. Such a model does not take into account the specific molecular mechanisms underlying RpaA/B regulation explored in the Results. Additionally, while most of the dusk genes underwent systematic changes, a small group of &#x223C;20 genes including <italic>kaiBC</italic> was relatively insensitive to changes in light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S4">Figure 4-figure supplement 4</xref>), and we do not model those genes&#x2019; expression dynamics.</p>
<p>Our model treats the activation or repression of the expression of a dusk gene cluster by RpaA&#x223C;P, RpaB&#x223C;P, or another cluster using effective Hill kinetics. We coarse-grained each of the three groups of circadian dusk genes (the Early, Middle, and Late clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) to a single effective gene with the average dynamics of the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, triangles). We modeled the dynamics of a gene cluster X using a simple kinetic model of an AND gate at a promoter [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>],

Bacteria can easily tune the interactions between proteins and between transcription factors and promoters to adjust H and <italic>K</italic> for different clusters [<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

where <italic>K</italic> is now the coefficient of repression. In equation 1, RpaA&#x223C;P, RpaB&#x223C;P, and Y were measured experimentally; the remainder of the parameters were left free.</p>
<p>We determined the sufficiency of a model to describe the data by fitting the parameters using the range of values shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">Table S4</xref>. Time propagation of the differential equation 1 was performed using the <italic>ode45</italic> solver in MATLAB, with X(<italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 0) set as the observed expression level at the beginning of the simulated time period. Model fitting was performed in MATLAB using the nonlinear least squares solver <italic>lsqnonlin</italic>.</p>
<p>The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Chi-squared test are typically used to quantify whether a model with more parameters fits the data better than another with fewer parameters simply because it is more complex. However, both approaches are for statistical models in which little to no information is used to construct the model and are not strictly applicable to the model constructed here, which is based on our understanding of transcription. If we do use AIC to compare the models, the feedback models are predicted to be most probable.</p>
<p>In our model, H and <italic>K</italic> are effective constants that represent the overall ability of RpaA&#x223C;P, RpaB&#x223C;P, or another gene cluster Y to affect gene expression. These constants include potential indirect activation through the sigma factors, which is may be why joint activation by RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P describe the dynamics of the Middle cluster reasonably well. However, circadian gating of the Early and Late dusk genes requires further interactions that cannot be described by Hill functions of measured RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P levels. Clearly there may be more complex networks at play that those we have considered here, and much more needs to be done to fully model gene expression in <italic>S. elongatus</italic>. Here we have constructed a first model to suggest simple principles underlying the interaction of circadian and light regulation of dusk genes and offer directions for further exploration.</p>

The growth rate of cells grown in Clear Day conditions varied throughout the day, showing slowest growth just prior to dusk (&#x223C;10 hour doubling time). Growth rate was estimated by calculating the change in the ln(OD<sub>750</sub>) of the culture before and after a 1 hour time period.

In the middle panel RpaA-D53E is not induced, and in the right panel IPTG was added to induce RpaA-D53E.

The left plot shows normalized Early cluster expression levels under Clear Day (magenta) and Shade pulse (gray) conditions used as model input in addition to the RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P dynamics shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>,E of the main text. The right plot shows the average expression values of the Middle cluster data (solid transparent lines), and the simulation produced the best fit model (dotted lines). Data for Clear Day conditions are plotted in magenta, and Shade pulse in gray. <bold>(B)</bold> Feedback model in which Late gene cluster expression is a repression Hill function of Early cluster expression levels and an activation Hill function of both RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P, presented as in (A). <bold>(C)</bold> Feedback model in which Late cluster expression is an activation Hill function of Middle cluster expression levels and an activation Hill function of both RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P. The left plot shows normalized Middle cluster expression levels under Clear Day (magenta) and Shade pulse (gray) conditions used as model input. The right plot shows the average expression values of the Late cluster data (solid transparent lines), and the simulation produced the best fit model (dotted lines). Data for Clear Day conditions are plotted in magenta, and Shade pulse in gray. <bold>(D)</bold> Feedback model in which Late cluster expression is a repression Hill function of Middle cluster expression levels and an activation Hill function of both RpaA&#x223C;P and RpaB&#x223C;P, presented as in (C). A model with an coherent feedforward architecture where the Middle cluster activates the Late cluster (C) best recapitulates the difference of the Late cluster responses to Shade and Clear Day Sunset. During the Shade pulse, the Middle cluster levels do not reach high enough levels to allow for strong activation of Late cluster expression, but at Sunset in Clear Day, Middle cluster levels reach high enough levels to activate the expression of the Late cluster.</p></caption>
