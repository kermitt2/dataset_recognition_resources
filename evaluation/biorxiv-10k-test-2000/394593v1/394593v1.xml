<title>Abstract</title>
<p>As information about the world traverses the brain, the signals exchanged between neurons are passed and modulated by synapses, or specialized contacts between neurons. While neurotransmitter-based synapses tend to be either relay excitatory or inhibitory pulses of influence on the postsynaptic neuron, electrical synapses, composed of plaques of gap junction channels, are always-on transmitters that can either excite or inhibit a coupled neighbor. A growing body of evidence indicates that electrical synapses, similar to their chemical counterparts, are modified in strength during physiological neuronal activity. The synchronizing role of electrical synapses in neuronal oscillations has been well established, but their impact on transient signal processing in the brain is much less understood. Here we constructed computational models based on the canonical feedforward neuronal circuit, and included electrical synapses between inhibitory interneurons. We provided discrete closely-timed inputs to the circuits, and characterize the influence of electrical synapses on both the subthreshold summation and spike trains in the output neuron. Our simulations highlight the diverse and powerful roles that electrical synapses play even in simple circuits. Because these canonical circuits are represented widely throughout the brain, we expect that these are general principles for the influence of electrical synapses on transient signal processing across the brain.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The role that electrical synapses play in neural oscillations, network synchronization and rhythmicity is well established, but their role neuronal processing of transient inputs is much less understood. Here we used computational models of canonical feedforward circuits and networks to investigate how the strength of electrical synapses regulates the flow of transient signals passing through those circuits. We show that because the influence of electrical synapses on coupled neighbors can be either inhibitory or excitatory, their role in network information processing is heterogeneous.. Because of the widespread existence of electrical synapses between interneurons as well as a growing body of evidence for their plasticity, we expect such effects play a significant role in how the brain processes transient inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Electrical synapses are prevalent across many brain regions, including thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and the neocortex [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast to neurotransmitter-based synapses, electrical synapses are an always-on mode of intracellular communication. Because signals cross two cell membranes, the net effect of an electrical synapse is that of a lowpass filter: spikes are heavily attenuated, while longer events, such as bursts, UP states, and the depolarizations that lead to spikes, are more readily shared between cells. Further, electrical synapses can exert either inhibitory or excitatory effects on a coupled neighbor, by increasing leak at rest or by transmitting activity such as depolarizations or spikelets. A growing body of work has demonstrated ways in which electrical synapses can be modulated or modified by either synaptic [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or spiking [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] forms of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>The role of electrical synapses in neuronal signal processing has mainly been explored in terms of their contributions to or regulation of synchrony of ongoing oscillations [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies focusing on the influence of electrical synapses on transient signals as they traverse the brain are fewer, but hint at specific and potentially powerful roles. For instance, propagation of spike afterhyperpolarizations through electrical synapses acts to reset and desynchronize regular firing in coupled cerebellar Golgi neurons [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Electrical synapses accelerate timing of spikes elicited near threshold in coupled thalamic reticular neighbors by tens of ms [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and similarly in coupled cerebellar basked cells, electrical synapses enhance and accelerate recruitment for coincident or sequential inputs [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Axonal gap junctions between neurons in the fly visual stream aid efficient encoding of the axis of rotation [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our previous work focused on the impact of electrical synapses on transient signals in the thalamacortical relay circuit, showing that electrical coupling between inhibitory neurons lead to increased separation of disparately-timed input while facilitating fusion of closely-timed inputs [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to generalize a role for electrical synapses and variations in their strength in neuronal information processing, here we considered the canonical microcircuit, wherein two principal neurons, connected by an excitatory synapse, are also connected by disynaptic feedforward inhibition (Fig.1A<sub>1</sub>)[<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This circuit motif reappears through the brain in areas ranging from the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], somatosensory L4 cortical neurons receiving inputs from the ventrobasal complex [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the cortical translaminar inhibitory circuit [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref><sub>2-4</sub>) Starting with a canonical circuit, we progressively expanded models to include interneurons coupled by electrical synapses in both circuit and network configurations. We provided these models with closely timed inputs, in order to determine how the embedded electrical synapse influences the summation or integration of those inputs at the output stage of the model. Our simulations demonstrate that electrical synapses between interneurons of the canonical circuit enable a high degree of specificity and diversity of processing of transient signals for both subthreshold activity and network activity. Because electrical synapses are widespread throughout the mammalian brain, we expect that these are principles that apply widely to neuronal processing of newly incoming information as it passes through the brain.</p>

<title>Subthreshold integration in a canonical circuit with electrical synapses</title>
<p>We started our inquiry by creating a three-cell circuit that represents the canonical microcircuit: two excitatory neurons, with an interneuron providing feedforward inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This model (Model 1a) produces a compound postsynaptic potential (PSP) in the target (Tgt) neuron that is a sum of a purely excitatory PSP from the source (Src) neuron and an inhibitory PSP arriving with a delay from the inhibitory interneuron (Int) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The features of the PSP &#x2013; its height, its total excitation, and the duration of its excitation window, all of which in combination may determine whether Tgt will spike given sufficient input &#x2013;depend predictably on the strength of the inhibitory PSP arriving from Int (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Increases in G<sub>GABA&#x2192;Tgt</sub> limit the integration window (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) and the area under excitatory portion of the PSP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, the interneuron limits the overall excitation and possible triggering of an action potential in Tgt.</p>
<p>To understand how Tgt might sum input from multiple sources, our next step towards building larger models was to include two Src neurons, which both synapsed onto a common Int and a common Tgt (Model 1b, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We provided both Src neurons with brief inputs sufficient to evoke single spikes in the Src neurons, while varying the time delay between the inputs &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub>. From these simulations, we observed that the inhibition from the common Int limited summation of the two Src signals in Tgt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) in two ways. Input timing differences of &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> &#x003E;1 ms led to sharp decreases in PSP peaks in Tgt (Fig.2C), as the inhibition from Int initiated by one Src decreased summed response with the second Src in Tgt. Summation of the Src signals in Int also accelerated the Int spike (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), thereby limiting the integration window in Tgt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). For delays between two inputs &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> longer than &#x223C;4 ms, a second input was consistently prevented from summation with the first input by the feedforward inhibition arriving as a result of the first input (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). Additionally, we noted that decreased excitability of the interneuron, in this case by providing less holding current to Int but which could arise from increased leakage in electrically coupled networks, shifted PSP summation, integration window and AUC incrementally towards larger values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). These results provide a baseline of expectations for a circuit with globally strong feedforward inhibition, for example one that includes interneurons that are strongly coupled.</p>

<p>Next, we expanded the circuit model to include two inhibitory Int neurons coupled by an electrical synapse (Model 2a, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We limited the range of strength of the electrical synapse to vary between 0 (uncoupled) and a coupling coefficient of &#x223C;0.3, which represents common strengths found in the thalamus [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and cortex [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>

<graphic xlink:href="394593_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We again provided this circuit with identical inputs, with time delay between the inputs &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub>. With no electrical synapse, either channel of input from Src could separately drive a PSP in Tgt. In that case, similarly to Model 1b, summation of the two inputs in Tgt is limited to &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> &#x003C; 4 ms by the PSP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, black lines). As electrical synapse strength increases, for &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> &#x003C; 4 ms we noted increased delays in Int<sub>1</sub> spiking due to increased leak from the electrical synapse, but decreased delays in Int<sub>2</sub> spiking due to the spikelet it received from Int<sub>1</sub>; together these effects result in a synchronizing effects of electrical coupling in this regime of input timing. Together, these changes in the timing of inhibition allowed for increased PSP peaks in Tgt (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), but dramatically decreased of the integration window in Tgt for &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> between 2 and 4 ms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), and increased the excited AUC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Hence, within Model 2a, electrical coupling enhanced Tgt input integration for specifically timed inputs, with increased PSP peaks within a narrowed integration window of the PSP. In the same circuit, for more than &#x223C;4 ms of &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub>, small increases in electrical synapse strength only served to increase leak in Int<sub>2</sub> well after the spikelet had finished, ultimately delaying its spike. Larger increases in electrical synapse strength, however, allowed for the spikelet from Int<sub>1</sub> to directly elicit spiking in Int<sub>2</sub>, which spiked earlier than it might have otherwise (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, lower right). The net effect allows the PSP in Tgt to increase by small amounts in peak (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) but the shortened integration window, resulting from the earlier spike in Int<sub>2</sub>, effectively prevents summation of the two Src inputs in Tgt. Thus, the varied effects of increased leak or excitatory spikelets resulting from an electrical synapse with varied strengths within even a simple circuit (Model 2a) increases flexibility for responses to signals passing through that circuit, compared to the same circuit with single interneuron (Model 1b).</p>
<p>A direct comparison between Model 1b, with one interneuron, and the most-strongly coupled results of Model 2a, is not apt, however: maintaining the synaptic parameters (see Methods) for Models 1b and 2a, meant that the total inhibitory conductance from Int to Tgt was doubled while the excitatory conductance from Src to Int was halved (see mismatch of dashed black lines and yellow lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). To explore a more consistent comparison of these two models, we ran the simulation again as Model 2a<sup>norm</sup> with halved G<sub>GABA&#x2192;Tgt</sub> and doubled G<sub>AMPA&#x2192;Int</sub> (see Methods; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3S</xref>.A). Results from the strongly coupled 2a<sup>norm</sup> were asymptotic to model 1b (yellow and dashed black lines <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3S</xref>.B, C<sub>1</sub> &#x2013; E<sub>1</sub>). The trends from Model 2a<sup>norm</sup> also preserved the trends from Model 2a for smaller values of &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> and G<sub>elec</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3S</xref>. C<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; E<sub>2</sub>). The larger differences in PSP peak and windows between Models 2a and 2a<sup>norm</sup> occurred for weaker coupling and larger &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub>, as the Tgt neuron in Model 2a<sup>norm</sup> received smaller total inhibitory input compared to Model 2a (compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> with 3S). However, in this model the maximal G<sub>elec</sub> in the range &#x003E; 8 nS that would form the basis for a comparison with Model 1b exceeds the average physiological range of coupling coefficients (cc &#x003E; 0.3).</p>
<p>While GABAergic coupling is rare between nearby electrically coupled inhibitory neurons of the thalamus [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it is sometimes observed between coupled pairs of inhibitory interneurons in cortex [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To test the additional effects of GABAergic connectivity between electrically coupled interneurons, we included symmetrical GABAergic synapses in our model (Model 2b, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). From these simulations, we see that for transient inputs separated by &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub>, the additional synapse further expanded the possibilities for subthreshold summation of inputs in Tgt. While the effect of G<sub>GABA&#x2192;Int</sub> on the peak PSP in Tgt was not substantially different from Model 2a, the integration window expanded with stronger inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), and the area under the excitatory part of the PSP was also expanded for stronger G<sub>GABA&#x2192;Int</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Further, in the presence of stronger reciprocal inhibition, increased electrical coupling shifted the integration windows and AUCs to favor larger values of &#x0394;t<sub>inp</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Thus, electrical and inhibitory synapses compete for impact on the PSP.</p>

<p>Thus, similar to our previous demonstration [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], electrical synapse between inhibitory interneurons and their impact through inhibitory synapses onto a target work together in diverse ways to control the processing of transient signals passing through a circuit. We also note that changes in electrical synapse strength can potentially halve or double the PSP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref><sub>1</sub>), the integration window (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref><sub>1</sub>, 4C) or area under the curve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3E</xref><sub>1</sub>, 4D); thus, modulation [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or activity-dependent modifications of electrical synapses [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] potentially have a powerful impact on summation of transient inputs in the Tgt cell.</p>

<title>Spiking responses in networks of canonical circuits with electrical synapses</title>
<p>To study a population of Tgt neurons of separate channels, we embedded 50 units of the canonical circuit into a network (Model Na, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), with electrical coupling between the Int neurons. To each Src neuron in the layer of 50, we provided identically sized inputs drawn from Gaussian distributions of input times with a standard deviation of &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In order to study spiking rather than subthreshold activity in the Tgt population, we increased G<sub>AMPA</sub> from the Src to the Tgt (G<sub>AMPA&#x2192;Tgt</sub>) and decreased G<sub>AMPA</sub> from Src to Int (G<sub>AMPA&#x2192;Int</sub>) in each unit, along with additional increases to Tgt excitability (see Methods) in order to elicit spiking in the Tgt neurons within 5-6 ms of Src spiking (consistent with latency to input in the somatosensory cortex [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). We then quantified the distribution of spike times in the Int and Tgt populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). From these results, we observed that increases in electrical synapse strength acted to narrow the distributions of spike times in the Int layer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, middle row), and markedly increased maximal amount of spiking for smaller &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub>. In the Tgt population, the narrowed Int distributions that resulted from increased electrical coupling acted to decrease the latency of Tgt from the input (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, bottom row and insets). Increased electrical synapse strength also decreased total spiking in Tgt, in fact selectively reducing later spikes, as a result of increased Int spiking.</p>

<p>Finally, we included GABAergic connectivity between the Ints of our network (Model Nb, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). The effects of electrical synapses on this network were similar to the previous model (Model Na): increases in electrical synapse strength decreased total spiking in Tgt, and selectively reduced later spikes, thus shifting its distribution to earlier times. Increased reciprocal inhibition was most effective for small values of &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub>, where stronger inhibition between Int neurons allowed Tgt neurons to spike more often, thus effectively counteracting the effect of electrical synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, first two columns).</p>

<p>We compared our two network models by plotting the gain in spiking properties due to electrical synapses relative to the uncoupled case (&#x03A3;G<sub>elec</sub> = 0) across input time distributions for the Int (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) and Tgt (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>) populations. While the input was Gaussian, the Tgt distributions were often not Gaussian; therefore, we measured mean spike times, standard deviations of spike times, maximal density and total density of spiking, along with the relative latency. We observed that most of the effects that electrical synapses exerted on the output Tgt distribution were strongest for small &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub>. Mean spike times both increased and decreased for different combinations of &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub> with inhibitory and electrical synapse strengths, while the spread (standard deviation) of spike times consistently increased with electrical synapse strength. Maximum density and total density of spiking, as well as relative latencies, decreased with increase in electrical synapse strength. Further, inclusion of larger reciprocal inhibition between the Int neurons led to decreased spiking within the Int population, thereby allowing Tgt neurons to spike faster, especially for the electrically uncoupled cases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, dark blue lines). Increased electrical coupling combined with reciprocal inhibition led to increased inhibition within the Int layer, leading to more-synchronized Int activity but decreased total responses of the Int population. As seen previously, the effects of electrical and inhibitory synapses within the Int layer competed, such that Tgt spiking decreased less for stronger inhibition.</p>

<p>Together, these results show that electrical synapses embedded within a network composed of canonical circuits have powerful and heterogeneous effects on the spiking of the Tgt output population, by altering spike times and total responses properties, as inputs from Src propagate through the network.</p>
<p>We quantified the mutual information between the spike time distributions of Src and Tgt, as well as the transmission efficiency from Src to Tgt (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). For wider input distributions, we expected that mutual information would be larger due to increased entropy in both the input and output. Without any reciprocal inhibition within the Int layer, electrical coupling contributed to decreases in Src and Tgt mutual information, and more so with smaller input distributions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, top row), as a result of dispersed Tgt spiking (cf. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Hence the transmission efficiency also decreased with electrical coupling, with more notable decreases with smaller &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>, top row). The largest decrease was roughly 35&#x0025;.</p>

<p>For the uncoupled case with no reciprocal inhibition, each Src elicited a single spike within its Tgt unit with predictable latency, leading to Tgt spike time distributions that mirrored Src distributions and resulted in maximal mutual information and 100&#x0025; transmission efficiency (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>&#x0026;B, top row). As interneuron reciprocal inhibition was added and spiking in the Int population decreased, some neurons within the Tgt distribution were able to spike much faster but with less uncertainty, creating a smaller distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) and smaller entropy; as a result, reciprocal inhibition led to decreases in both mutual information and transmission efficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, our simulations show that electrical synapses between interneurons in canonical networks regulate both subthreshold activity and network spiking activity, ultimately exerting powerful effects on the output activity of the network while processing and passing on its inputs. The general effect was, for closely-timed inputs, that increase in electrical coupling strength led to (a) the delay of spiking in the inhibitory interneurons, which enabled larger summations in the target output earlier; yet simultaneously (b) stronger synchronized inhibition from the interneuron population to the target population at a later time, which limited the output of target. These competing effects highlight the diverse roles that electrical synapses of dynamically varying strength might play in circuits across the brain.</p>
<p>Electrical synapses in a local network regulate subthreshold summation of inputs in the target neuron. Stronger electrical coupling allowed the target neuron to integrate its source inputs with higher summed PSP peaks, yet limited time windows for further inputs to summate. Furthermore, changes in electrical coupling in a local network of interneurons, possibly via electrical synapse plasticity, led to more flexibility in regulating subthreshold summation than a global inhibitory neuron with varied excitability. However, our results also showed that reciprocal inhibition between the electrically coupled interneuron pair expanded the integration window and the area under the curve of the target PSP, especially for relatively larger differences in input timings. This suggests that the competition between the electrical coupling and reciprocal inhibition within the local interneuron networks could regulate the ability for the target neuron to either be a coincidence detector or an integrator.</p>
<p>At a network level, we find that electrical coupling of the interneuron population modulates the target population activity over different distribution of input timings. Similar to the subthreshold effect, increase in electrical synapse strength led to a more delayed, yet more concentrated activity in the interneuron population, effectively synchronizing their activity. Hence, stronger electrical coupling allowed stronger earlier response of the target layer activity but weaker response afterwards. However, because the activity of the interneurons was limited within a smaller temporal window due to electrical coupling, inhibition towards the target population was limited in time, hence the output activity was more sustained compared to uncoupled cases. As a result, electrical coupling allowed earlier yet more spread out responses and effectively reduced both the mutual information and the transmission efficiency, but mainly for small input distribution sizes. One implication of this is, although corrupting the integrity of input-output temporal coding, electrical coupling between the interneurons could increase temporal heterogeneity as inputs coming from different sources arrive too closely with each other. On the contrary, reciprocal inhibition within this population decreased the interneuron activity, which led to much less decrease of target response in presence of electrical coupling. However, for closely-timed input distributions, the target temporal code distribution was also changed towards less output timing spread, especially for electrically uncoupled or weak coupled cases, resulting in loss of mutual information and transmission efficiency in the presence of reciprocal inhibition.</p>
<p>These results point toward yet another competition between electrical coupling and reciprocal inhibition within the interneuron population at the network level to regulate the temporal code of the output distribution. Although both disrupt the input-output temporal integrity of closely-timed input distributions, electrical synapses increase temporal heterogeneity while the inhibitory synapses increase temporal homogeneity. As transient processing due to electrical coupling of inhibitory neurons does not receive much attention, the implications are not known. As recent work shows, there exist gap junctions between PV interneurons across barrel boundaries [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], suggesting there may be electrical coupling even across different barrel cortex via intermediate interneurons. One implication of our network simulations is that temporal heterogeneity due to electrical coupling would help separate inputs coming too close to each other in time but from different sources.</p>

<p>The canonical disynaptic feedforward-inhibition network can be simplified as a small 3-cell network (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref><sub>1</sub>), comprising of a Src (source), an Int (interneuron) and a Tgt (target) neuron.

In our simulations, Ints are either only electrically coupled (Models 2a, 2a<sup>norm</sup> and Na) or both electrically coupled and reciprocally inhibit each other (Models 2b, Nb).

<title>Normalized properties of spike time distributions</title>
<p>To easily compare between different initial input distributions, we generally normalized all quantifications to the Src population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> &#x2013; 7). More specifically, for each X<sub><italic>C</italic></sub> = X(&#x03B8;, <italic>C</italic>), we defined normalized mean spike time as the difference between the mean of X<sub><italic>C</italic></sub> and that of X<sub><italic>Src</italic></sub>.

<p>For each X<sub><italic>C</italic></sub> = X(&#x03B8;, <italic>C</italic>), we calculated the spike density from the smoothed histograms of spikes times. More specifically, each array of spike times X<sub><italic>C</italic></sub> was histogrammed with a bin width that equals to one-tenth of the &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub> in order to avoid under-sampling with small &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub> and over-sampling with large &#x03C3;<sub>inp</sub>; then it was smoothed by convoluting with a Hanning window of size 20 to obtain the un-normalized density <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t). For visualization, the spike times were translated relative to the mean Src spike time distributions, whereas the densities were scaled over the maximum density of the Src distribution to calculate the normalized density <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t). Note: neither <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t) nor <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t) represented estimated probability density function, because the smoothed histograms were not normalized by their number of samples.</p>
<p>For quantification comparison, we defined normalized maximum density as the maximum density of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t) normalized over that of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>Src</italic></sub>(t). The normalized total response was calculated by normalizing the area under the curve of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t) over that of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>Src</italic></sub>(t) (note: neither <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t) nor <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>(t) represented estimated probability density function, hence AUC was not necessarily 1).

We consider any missing spike (for example with cases that Src<sub>i</sub> did not induce any spike in Tgt<sub>i</sub> due to certain network configurations or parameter set) to take the value of max(X<sub><italic>C</italic></sub>) &#x002B; 2&#x03C3;(X<sub><italic>C</italic></sub>) to account for more accurate estimation of the marginal distribution of both Src and Tgt.

<caption><title>Model 2a<sup>norm</sup>: Comparison between single-interneuron control network and coupled interneuron network with normalized synaptic strengths.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold>: Schematic for the network identical to Model 2a but with <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="394593_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> doubled and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="394593_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> halved. This was done to easily compare between the coupled network and the control network. <bold>B</bold>: Examples of Tgt PSP due to different electrical synapse strengths between interneurons of the coupled network (colored lines and legends), in comparison to the control single-interneuron network (black dashed-dotted lines and legends). Each subpanel represents different values of input timing differences. Scale bar is 1 mV, 1 ms. Colored legends represent the spike times of Int<sub>1</sub> (filled circle &#x2022;) and Int<sub>2</sub> (filled triangle &#x25B4;), in which each color represents different values of G<sub>elec</sub> between the two interneurons in the coupled network. The black open circle (&#x25CB;) represents the spike times of the single Int neuron in the control network. The dotted line represents Tgt resting potential. <bold>C-E</bold>: The effects on integration window of the coupled network asymptote those in the control network with sufficiently large interneuron electrical coupling, although corresponding to highly unlikely coupling coefficient. For each panel, subpanel <italic>1</italic> (top) shows 2D plot with each colored line representing different electrical coupling, while the dashed-dotted line represents the control network; subpanel <italic>2</italic> (bottom) shows the heatmap of the same data from the coupled network.</p></caption>
