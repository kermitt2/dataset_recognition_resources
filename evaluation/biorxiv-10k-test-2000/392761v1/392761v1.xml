<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Studies conducted in time series could be far more informative than those questioning at a specific moment in time. However, when it comes to genomic data, time points are sparse creating the need for a constant search for methods capable of extracting information out of experiments of this kind. We propose a feature selection algorithm embedded in a hidden Markov model applied to gene expression time course data on either single or even multiple biological conditions. For the latter, in a simple case-control study features or genes are selected under the assumption of no change over time for the control samples, while the case group must have at least one change. The proposed model reduces the feature space according to a two-state hidden Markov model. The two states define change/no-change in gene expression. Features are ranked in consonance with three scores: number of changes across time, magnitude of such changes and quality of replicates as a measure of how much they deviate from the mean. An important highlight is that this strategy overcomes the few samples limitation, common in genomic experiments through a process of data transformation and rearrangement. To prove this method, our strategy was applied to three publicly available data sets. Results show that feature domain is reduced to up to 90&#x0025; leaving only few but relevant features yet with findings consistent to those previously reported. Moreover, our strategy proved to be robust, stable and working on studies where sample size is an issue otherwise. Hence, even with two biological replicates and/or three time points our method proves to work well.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The variety of methods for the analysis of gene expression with longitudinal measurements proposed aim to classify genes according to their expression profile over time. Approaches focus on searching for genes with: large changes at any given time, multiple changes across the time series, similar/opposed profile or a focal time point where most changes occur among others. What differs between these methods is the mathematical way they reach those goals. In all cases, we deal with noisy data, small number of time points, limited replication and questionable dependencies. In this work, we present a review of the state-of-the-art of such methods and propose a novel algorithm that integrates a probabilistic graphical approach using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), ideal for modeling sequential data convoluted with feature selection (FS) for gene classification. Its novel contribution or major innovation resides in how the method handles limited data points and low replication. This innovation is relevant because most genome-based studies face this same challenge, particularly longitudinal designs for which, sample size is a combination of time measurements and biological replicates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High dimensional genomic data is described by many features, however, many are either redundant or irrelevant. Identifying those is key in order to claim results are trustworthy. Data mining techniques, machine learning algorithms or statistic models are applied to classify features but at the cost of other important problems such as model over-fitting or the increase of computational resources and higher analysis cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. A possible approach to this classification problem is to reduce data dimensionality with feature extraction (FE) or with feature selection techniques (FS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>FS is a technique often used in domains where there are many features and comparatively few samples, particularly used in microarray or RNAseq studies where there are thousands of features and a small number of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. FS is the process of eliminating irrelevant features in the data by extracting only a subset of informative ones. Its main objectives include avoid overfitting, eliminate noise in the data, reduce algorithmic rate of convergence, improve model performance and, give a more accurate interpretation of features in the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. It is important not to be confounded with FE such as principal components analysis or compression, where they use the projection of the original set to a new feature space of lower dimensionality. In FE, the new feature space is a linear or even non-linear combination of the original features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. FS on the other hand, identifies relevant features without altering the original domain.</p>
<p>Due to the high dimensionality of most gene expression analyses, it is necessary to select the most relevant features to get better results interpretation and a deeper insight into the underlying process that generated the data. However, the noisy data and small sample size pose a great challenge for many modelling problems in bioinformatics making necessary to use adequate evaluation criteria or stable and robust FS models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In general, FS techniques can be classified into three main categories: filters, wrappers, and embedded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Filters take as input all the features and reduce them into a relevant subset independent of the model parameters. Wrappers select a subset of features using a search algorithm, then estimate the model parameters for that subset and perform an evaluation test for each model. Wrappers use FS for model identification by selecting the model parameters that best fit the training data and has the highest evaluation score. The embedded approach takes all the features at once, maximizes a learning algorithm optimizing model performance and outputs both the reduced feature set along with its model parameters. In this work we address the classification of time series gene expression data using two embedded processes feature selection and hidden Markov models.</p>
<p>A variety of FS techniques that have been proposed can be classified into parametric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and non-parametric methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The non-parametric methods aim to make a less stringent distribution assumptions, however, validation in the context of small sample sizes is a challenge. Parametric methods assume there is a given distribution for the observed data. The most common parametric latent variable models are the Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and hidden Markov models (HMM). The mixture model is often used to model multimodal data, while the HMM is often used for modeling time series data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In most applications of HMMs, features are pre-selected based on domain knowledge and the feature selection procedure is completely omitted. Some methods have been explored to reduce the feature space by using HMMs as stated in Adams and Beling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. However, FS strategies specifically with HMM are sparse. For example, the work of Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] shows a wrapper FS approach to get the best model and then the feature subset for a continuous HMM. The authors proposed a new set of continuous variables, defined as salient features, to avoid searching the space of all feature subsets and to prevent losing information about the original variable. The salient features have proved their effectiveness for FS in GMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Finally, they apply a variational Bayesian framework to infer the salient features, the number of hidden states and the model parameters simultaneously.</p>
<p>Adams et <italic>al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] propose a feature saliency hidden Markov model. This model also uses feature saliencies variables and they represent the probability that a feature is relevant by distinguishing between state-dependent and state-independent distributions. If the number of hidden states is known, this approach simultaneously provides maximum a posteriori estimates and select the relevant feature subset by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Finally, the most recent work is introduced in Zheng et <italic>al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Their strategy combines a hidden Markov model, a localized feature saliency measure and two t-Student distributions to describe the relevant and non-relevant features, to accurately model emission parameters for each hidden state. All the parameters are estimated using a Variational Bayes framework.</p>
<p>Most of these methods use saliency parameters additionally to those required by the model, therefore, when analyzing genomic data the increase of variables to be estimated from data becomes a hurdle. Besides, the number of hidden states necessary to model the data also affects the total parameters to estimate. Hence, a strategy that make use of a minimal number of parameters to get the most relevant features from a data set is indispensable to study genomic data.</p>
<p>In this article we present a novel strategy for FS capable of selecting and ranking relevant genes based on the changes between conditions and successive times, using an embedded FS technique with a HMM at its core. Lack of replication is handled using a novel data rearrangement that overcome the limitations of few samples in genomics experiment designs. To prove its efficiency, the strategy is applied to three publicly available data sets.</p>

<title>Overview of the strategy</title>
<p>We present a strategy that selects the most relevant features (genes) from high dimensional genomic experiments with longitudinal design for one or multiple conditions. The approach first compares gene profiles over time on the affected samples against those in the control group. Next, it scores the relevant features providing a ranking that can be used to further reduce the data set.</p>
<p>The complete pipeline takes an expression matrix from either a microarray or an RNAseq experiment as input and returns the list of ranked features. The main steps in the process involve transforming and rearranging input data, estimate the model parameters, evaluate time course expression profiles and select relevant features providing a ranking score for such genes. Code for each step in the pipeline is structured as a collection of single functions that allow user to customize methods, the full pipeline is available as an R-library. Some plots are also included. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref> shows the schematic representation of the proposed strategy. Source code can be found as supplementary information S1 File.</p>

<p>A key element of this strategy is the use of the Occam&#x2019;s razor or law of parsimony in the state transition model used for the HMM. The hidden state complexity is reduced to a minimum with a two-node clique that is capable of fully describing system dynamics by only considering a change or no change in gene expression over time. The &#x2018;change&#x201D; state would model either up or down regulation. Therefore, with only two states we are able to define three different behaviors.</p>

<title>Validation using real data</title>
<p>The strategy was applied to three different publicly available datasets, two from the Gene Expression Omnibus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and one from the Japanese Toxicogenomics Project (TGP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. We used RNA-seq data (GSE75417) comprised of 6 time points, 2 conditions and 3 replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Illumina Microarray gene expression data (GSE39549) consisting of 9 time points, 2 conditions and 3 replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Affymetrix Microarrays (TGP) a variety of studies on hepatotoxic compounds made up of 3 time-points, 1 control, 3 conditions and 2-to-3 replicates. These datasets were uploaded as .Rdata to be used with the R-package of our method at github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/robalecarova/FSHMM">https://github.com/robalecarova/FSHMM</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ikaros induced B3 cells</title>
<p>The first example, based in the work by Ferreiros et <italic>al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] where B3 pre-B-cell line is transduced with mouse stem cell virus retroviral vectors encoding wild-type Ikaros or Aiolos tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope followed by an internal ribosomal entry site and GFP. B3 cells containing inducible Ikaros were treated with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and sampled at 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after Ikaros induction. The control counterpart (not induced) were also sampled at the same times. Data are available at GEO with accession number GSE75417. Gene expression data comprised 2 conditions, 6 time points per condition and 3 biological replicates per time-point leading to 36 RNAseq samples.</p>
<p>Results were compared to those reported in Ferreiros et <italic>al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] which, provided a list of differentially expressed genes as well as the enriched pathways in their Excel Supp 1. Only two comparisons were selected mainly because we only had access to those results. Further comparison included an enrichment analysis with DAVID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] to match the approach used in what was originally reported. According to the GO terms, results showed many shared pathways, although the number of genes in each differed. We found that 44&#x0025; of pathways are shared by the two approaches the remainder 56&#x0025; involves leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, its regulation and some immune system cascades such as JAK/STAT. The cut-off value used, was a natural p-value of 0.05. The list of common and exclusive pathways are available as Supplementary data S1 Table.</p>
<p>We should consider though that the FSHMM strategy used all samples and all time-points to train the model which, presents a better idea of the dynamics in the experiment as opposed to analyzing isolated time-points. Details of genes and pathways are available as Supplementary data S2 Table and S3 Table.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>High-fat diet in mouse model</title>
<p>A second example with longitudinal design is the one published by Kwon <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and available through GSE39549. It is on an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model with two conditions high-fat and normal diet. Both with same time measurements, nine time points at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of high-fat or normal diet intake. The authors analyzed differential expression between both diets. However, they focused on diet effect at each time without considering the longitudinal nature of the study or a temporal dependency. They reported a total of 2037 differentially expressed genes as a result of adding all same-time contrasts. Using FSHMM the number of relevant genes obtained were 1922. We could not report level of agreement between the two studies because the list of differentially expressed genes was not released with their paper. However, a gene set enrichment analysis was performed on the FSHMM results using DAVID, see Supplementary data S4 Table. A caveat regarding this analysis is that search in DAVID involves a variety of parameters associated to different databases, the authors did not elaborate on which ones were used. Therefore, we decided to use the <italic>GOTERM-BP-FAT</italic> considering the cellular process to which they belong.</p>
<p>Their results showed an enrichment analysis that favors pathways involved in immune response, metabolic process and response to wounding. As stated before, these enriched pathways only considered the treatment <italic>vs</italic> control contrasts. When we compared these results with those obtained by FSHMM, common pathways are those associated to immune response. Hence, either time-by-time comparisons or considering the whole system the level of correlation is good. However, when proposing a time course experiment we should also consider studying the system dynamics instead of partitioning as if we had multiple pair-wise studies. Details of this analysis are available in S4 Table, the shared pathways are shown in yellow, comparing them with Table 2 in Kwon <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In terms of genes found, the authors report Emr1, CCL2, 6 and 7, Adam8, IL1rn, Itgam, CD3, 4, 9, 14 and 180, TLR1, 3, 6 and 7, Tgfb1, Irf5, Mmp12, Col1a, Col2, Col3a1, Col4a5, Col8a1, Col9a3, Col16a1, Ctsa, Ctsb, Ctsk, Ctsl, Ctss and Ctsz as some of the genes differentially expressed in the comparison between same-time contrasts. FSHMM classified as relevant CCL2, 6 and 7, CD14 and CD180, TLR1, 6 and 7, Irf5, Mmp12, Col3a1 and Col1a2. Leading to over 50&#x0025; of genes found in common. On the other hand, the authors report that the Resistin signaling is activated through the NF-&#x03BA;B transcription factor. In the enriched pathways found with FSHMM, the I-&#x03BA;B kinase/NF-&#x03BA;B signalling was reported, an important finding that coincides between the two analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Toxicogenomics data</title>
<p>The third and final example was a dataset from a time series experimental design to study hepatotoxic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The selected compound was Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) as it is known to be one of the most potent hepatotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and is usually used in scientific research to investigate possible beneficial effects from hepatoprotective agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The study involves only three time measurements at 2, 8 and 24 hours after dose administration with control and three doses: none, low and middle with two replicates leading to a 18 samples. This is an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment limited in terms of observation space and it was chosen precisely because it represented the <italic>worst case scenario</italic> when it comes to a longitudinal study. It represented the most challenging data to evalulate FSHMM on. Interestingly enough, the number of selected features yielded 1878 genes. The list of all of them is reported in S5 Table as Supplementary information. Pathway analysis using DAVID led to enriched GO terms mainly related to cell regulation, cell and nuclear division, adherens juntion and cell-cell signaling. This correlated to the toxic behavoir of CCl<sub>4</sub> in liver. Nevertheless, to have another perspective of the results, the KEGG database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] was used with pathways selected as relevant if they had a p-value lower than 0.05. The significant pathways were also consistent with DAVID and were related to cell regulation, nuclear division, adherens junction and cell-cell signaling. However some of the most relevant pathways that were statisticaly significant were Apoptosis, RNA degradation and the most important was the Carbon metabolism as this is directly related to CCl<sub>4</sub>. When classification parameters were tighten to get more over-represented pathways using the top 200 features, the Nucleotide excision repair pathway was enriched. This pathway is a mechanism to recognize and repair bulky DNA damage caused by xenobiotic factors as compounds, environmental carcinogens, and exposure to UV-light. All of this correlates to what is known about CCl<sub>4</sub> and its toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Aquiring this level of knowledge with so limited information made FSHMM a perfect choice even on studies this short. The enriched GO terms and details are in Supp S6 Table while the KEGG pathways are in Supp S7 Table.</p>
<p>In summary, for all three cases the feature space was reduced and almost 90&#x0025; of the variables were filtered out, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Remarkably, the limited size of replicated observations and time-points were not an issue for the FSHMM to reduce the feature space to a more manageable and yet informative size. The presented method makes use of all time measurements of replicated gene expression values as input and is able to get the most relevant genes by using a HMM as feature classifier.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Results using the FSHMM strategy outputs a subset of relevant features which is relatively low compared to the original set but yet, it proved to be informative even in situations where number of replicates is as low as two and time series only involves 3 point measurements. The three datasets used to validate our method were chosen because they covered microarray and RNAseq data. Also, because they offered opportunity to compare its efficiency at a pathway level as it was the case of Ikaros data, or gene-to-gene level as we did for the high-fat diet study or on common knowledge after literature review on results from the toxicogenomics data. In all three cases, the strategy efficiently reduced the number of relevant features, simplified the analysis, maintain the time series nature of the studies and provided an insight to the system dynamics. Features were selected according to three scores. One evaluates gene perturbation over time adding more value to genes that fluctuate more over time. A second score evaluates the magnitude of those perturbations and the third score evaluate statistical significance by means of consistency among replicates.</p>
<p>The parameters of the proposed HMM estimated from all three data sets had the same mean vector in their emitted normal distributions. This happens because the HMM models the magnitude of the change in expression instead of the actual expression level. This fact agrees with the hypothesis that only a small set of genes change, and according to our assumptions only those changing in the condition group with no changes among the control set are considered. Therefore, the distributions are centered around zero and this further reduces the number of parameters to estimate from data.</p>
<p>Parameters estimated from data using FSHMM strategy were compared to the models presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], with the conclusion that saliency variables were found not to be necessary, making it all more feasible for a genomic context where the number of observations is low so the less parameters to estimate, the better. The FSHMM used two hidden states to represent relevant features and non-relevant features similar to Zheng et <italic>al,</italic> however the multivariate normal distributions proposed let the user to provide all the replicates with its inherent variability to model the system dynamics.</p>
<p>Also, it is essential to highlight the role of data preprocessing but even more important the input data rearrangement. For our FSHMM strategy, each gene represents a different observation sequence in the training matrix. Therefore, even if the sample size is low, the model parameters can be estimated from data. Moreover, with the feature randomization, it is less probable to overfit. We also analyzed the idea of adding a third hidden state to model the up-regulation, down-regulation, and no-change. Results showed it was not worth it to add complexity by increasing the dimensionality of the hidden vector but instead keep it as simple as possible would allow us to handle studies with minimum counts of data points. The model feeds from changes in expression instead of expression levels themselves, still we can model the sign of the state that emitted the observation. Thus, the two hidden state transition graph is capable of modelling the desired dynamics without increasing the model complexity.</p>

<title>Feature selection with a hidden Markov model</title>
<p>The Feature Selection with a hidden Markov model (FSHMM) strategy starts with an already normalized gene expression matrix, a vector of time points, the biological conditions, the number of replicates and if necessary a set of parameters to customize the model estimation. Data is rearranged into matrices, one per each condition. Then, it is necessary to remove the offset value of each feature by computing the differences in gene expression between consecutive time points. Therefore, instead of using the expression level of each feature for the model parameters, it will receive the change in expression from two consecutive times.</p>
<p>The selected model is a HMM with two hidden states as proposed in Adams <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and Zheng <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. However, in the proposed model the states represent a non-relevant change in expression (N) and a relevant change (C). The former has the function of a null-hypothesis where most of the features will reside, while the later is the alternative hypothesis. The observations are assumed to be drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with dimensionality equal to the number of biological replicates or a univariate normal distribution if the replicates are summarized. The proposed model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>. Parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the path of hidden states X for each feature per condition is decoded using the Viterbi algorithm. Each feature decoded path is compared to the null-hypothesis that is represented by a sequence of non-relevant changes; if the feature rejects it, then it is selected as relevant. Finally, each relevant feature is ranked by the number of changes, the magnitude of each change and the biological replicates behaviour.</p>

<title>Hidden Markov model</title>
<p>Hidden Markov models are stochastic processes based on Markov chains, where the states X<sub>1:T</sub> and <italic>X<sub>t</sub> G x<sub>1:N</sub></italic> are connected through a transition matrix. Each state <italic>X<sub>t</sub></italic> can produce a measurable observation <italic>Y<sub>t</sub></italic>. These observations only depend of the system&#x2019;s present state, P(Y<sub>t</sub>|X<sub>t</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Unlike the Markov chains, the state variables in the HMM are hidden, this means that they cannot be measured. However, it is assumed that they follow a Markov chain and the transition probability matrix follows a multinomial distribution. If the observations are categorical, then they also follow a multinomial distribution. However, if they are continuous they are assumed to follow a univariate or multivariate normal distribution. Each hidden state has its own mean vector and variance/convariance matrix.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Decoding - Viterbi algorithm</title>
<p>The decoding function is used to get the hidden states that were traversed by the Markov chain. To decode the states in a hidden Markov model the most commonly used algorithms are the <italic>posterior decoding</italic> and the <italic>Viterbi algorithm</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The Viterbi algorithm is a greedy optimization approach to get the most probable path traversed by the Markov chain. The algorithm computes the best set of hidden states that can explain the present observation, starting from the first one. As it greedily tries to get the best path, it looks for the previous hidden state that maximizes the current joint probability. The algorithm continues to get the best values for each observation until the full sequence has been analyzed. Once it has the most probable outcome, it retraces back its path and outputs it as the most probable path that generated the observation sequence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Expectation-maximization algorithm</title>
<p>The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied when there is missing data, or an optimization problem does not have an analytical solution but can be simplified by assuming the existence of hidden variables. The EM algorithm objective is to maximize the complete data set log-likelihood in a two-step procedure. In the first step, it computes the function&#x2019;s expected value to fill the missing data. And in the second step the algorithm maximizes the model parameters given the <italic>complete data set</italic>. The process is iterated until the convergence criteria are met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>

<title>Computational pipeline</title>
<p>The proposed strategy was divided in three stages as stated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>, each one fulfills a specific objective and are sequentialy executed. These stages are explained below.</p>
<sec id="s4e1">
<title>Data preprocessing</title>
<p>The first step in the pipeline is the data rearrangement and transformation. Each condition is organized in a 3D matrix. Each feature <italic>g</italic> is represented as a matrix with the time points as columns and replicates as rows, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq 1</xref>. The arrangement differs from the usual 2D matrices where the rows contain the features and the columns have time-points and biological replicates. In this strategy an innovative arrangement is proposed, where each condition is organized in a 3D matrix with time points as columns, replicates as rows and as many slices as genes or features are included. With this data arrangement, the few samples limitation that arise in genomic experiments is overcome, given that each feature will be a different observation sequence to fit the model. For a finer parameter estimation, the replicates can be treated as they are or can be summarized by taking the mean or median of them per time measurement.

</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Then, each feature expression value its transformed to get the expression change by substracting the two consecutive time points, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq 2</xref>. With this transformation, the offset value is removed. It is necessary to remove this value because there are features with the same time profile but are shifted given its initial expression value. Thus, without the offset, they can be compared and analyzed as the same profile, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>. However, as result from the transfomation, the observation matrix columns are reduced from size <italic>T</italic> to <italic>T</italic> &#x2013; 1. For the next step, as it estimates the model parameters, the order of the features may bias the estimation. Therefore, a randomization step is done to shuffle them. This process is based in the preprocess of the sub-sampling cross-validation approach to avoid overfitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].

<title>Feature selection</title>
<p>After the data has been organized, the shuffled features are used to estimate the model parameters. With the HMM fitted to the data, the Viterbi algorithm is applied to each feature in each condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>. Once each gene has its hidden path decoded, they are compared. In the case of multiple conditions, if at least one condition has a change, but the control is flat, the feature is considered as relevant. And in the case of only one condition without a control or baseline to compare with, all the features that have a flat behavior are discarded, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>.</p>
