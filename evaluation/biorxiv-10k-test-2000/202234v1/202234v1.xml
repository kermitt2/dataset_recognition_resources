<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium africanum</italic> (<italic>Maf</italic>) causes up to half of human tuberculosis in West Africa, but little is known on this pathogen. We compared the genomes of 253 <italic>Maf</italic> clinical isolates from Ghana, including both L5 and L6. We found that the genomic diversity of L6 was higher than in L5, and the selection pressures differed between both groups. Regulatory proteins appeared to evolve neutrally in L5 but under purifying selection in L6. Conversely, human T cell epitopes were under purifying selection in L5, but under positive selection in L6. Although only 10&#x0025; of the T cell epitopes were variable, mutations were mostly lineage-specific. Our findings indicate that <italic>Maf</italic> L5 and L6 are genomically distinct, possibly reflecting different ecological niches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The global phylogeography of the human-adapted <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) demonstrates highest diversity in West Africa, with six out of the seven known lineages represented<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Two of these lineages, Lineage 5 (L5) and Lineage 6 (L6), together originally known as <italic>Mycobacterium africanum</italic> (<italic>Maf</italic>), are restricted to West Africa for unknown reasons. By contrast, MTBC lineages belonging to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> sensu stricto (<italic>Mtbss</italic>), in particular Lineage 4 (L4), are more geographically widespread<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. <italic>M. africanum</italic> has remained an important pathogen in West Africa since its first description in 1968<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, and is responsible for up to half of human tuberculosis (TB) in some regions<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The MTBC is thought to have originally emerged in Africa and subsequently spread to other parts of the world following waves of human migrations, trade and conquests<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Yet the reason(s) why <italic>Maf</italic> is limited to West Africa despite, for example, centuries of the trans-Atlantic slave trade remains unknown. Some comparative studies have identified phenotypic differences between the two <italic>Maf</italic> lineage<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, suggesting they might be fundamentally distinct and occupy different ecological niches.</p>
<p>Three hypotheses have been put forward to explain the restriction of <italic>Maf</italic> to West Africa. The first hypothesis proposes that <italic>Maf</italic> might have emigrated outside of Africa but was later outcompeted by <italic>Mtbss</italic>, which has been shown to be more virulent than <italic>Maf</italic> in animal models<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The second hypothesis states that the restriction of <italic>Maf</italic> to West Africa is due to its adaptation to West African human populations<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Finally, according to the third hypothesis, <italic>Maf</italic> might be zoonotic with an animal reservoir restricted to West Africa.</p>
<p>Some evidence in support of the first hypothesis is the reported association of <italic>Maf</italic> (L6) with HIV co-infection, attenuated ESAT-6 responses and delayed progression to active disease relative to <italic>Mtbss</italic><sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In addition, both <italic>Maf</italic> lineages as well as <italic>Mtbss</italic> L1, together described as &#x201C;ancestral&#x201D; MTBC lineages, have been shown to elicit a stronger early production of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to the &#x201C;modern&#x201D; MTBBC L2, L3 and L4<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The delayed pro-inflammatory immune response in the &#x201C;modern&#x201D; MTBC lineages might allow for more rapid disease progression and transmission<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The second hypothesis is supported by the statistical association of L5 with the native West African ethnic group known as &#x201C;Ewe&#x201D; reported by two independent studies in Ghana<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The third hypothesis is mainly supported by the phylogenetic placement of <italic>Maf</italic> (L6) amidst the cluster of the animal-adapted members of the MTBC in the various phylogenies of the MTBC<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>If the first hypothesis is true, the proportion of <italic>Maf</italic> associated TB in West Africa is expected to decline over time. However, there are conflicting reports of the proportion of <italic>Maf</italic> associated TB in West Africa. Even though the report of a steady decline of <italic>Maf</italic> associated TB in some settings seems to support the first hypothesis<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, other studies indicate that <italic>Maf</italic> remains an important cause of TB in West-Africa<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In Ghana for instance, a recent study showed that the proportion of TB due to <italic>Maf</italic> remained constant over the 8 year study period<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Even though, the reported statistical association of L5 with ethnicity in Ghana suggests a possible co-evolutionary scenario in favour of the second hypothesis, genetic evidence of co-evolution/co-adaptation remains to be demonstrated. In the case of the third hypothesis, the environmental or zoonotic reservoir(s) need to be identified.</p>
<p>In this study, we used whole genome sequencing of Ghanaian <italic>Maf</italic> clinical strains to explore genomic differences between the two <italic>Maf</italic> lineages that might support one or more of these hypotheses.</p>

<title>Whole genome SNP distance, average nucleotide diversity and phylogeny of <italic>Maf</italic> in Ghana</title>
<p>Our data set comprised <italic>Maf</italic> isolates obtained from TB patients reporting to various hospitals in Ghana. After excluding genomes that did not meet the criteria for mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary figure S1</xref>), 253 <italic>Maf</italic> genomes (175 L5 and 78 L6) were used for the analysis. Patients&#x2019; residential regions are provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary figure S2</xref>). The upper right pie chart indicates those 97 patients (55 infected with L5 and 42 with L6) with no information on region of residence. We found the number of fixed SNPs (SNPs found in more than 95&#x0025; of genomes) in a genome compared to the MTBC ancestor<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> to be significantly higher in L6 (1,037) compared to L5 (928) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p &#x003C; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). Moreover, despite the larger number of L5 genomes (more than twice the number of L6 genomes) analyzed, the mean pairwise SNP distance between any two strains was significantly higher in L6 (360) compared to L5 (223) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p &#x003C; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B)</xref>. Finally, the whole genome average nucleotide diversity (<italic>&#x03C0;</italic>) for L6 (0.000110) was significantly higher compared to L5 (0.00007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>, non-overlapping 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI)). Taken together, these findings show that L6 in Ghana is significantly more genetically diverse than L5 irrespective of sample size. The whole genome-based phylogenetic tree of the Ghanaian <italic>Maf</italic> strains generated from 11,027 total polymorphic positions between the <italic>Maf</italic> strains and the MTBC ancestor reference excluding repetitive and mobile genetic element rooted on <italic>M. canettii</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The <italic>Maf</italic> lineages were resolved as two distinct branches of the genome-based tree with possible sub-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Genetic diversity of L6 is significantly higher than L5 among T cell epitopes and genes of other functional categories</title>
<p>We found that the higher diversity of L6 compared to L5 was reflected across all the 8 functional categories of genes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Whereas pairwise nucleotide diversity (<italic>&#x03C0;</italic>) for L5 was below 0.0001 across all functional categories, the estimates for L6 were all above 0.0001. The most prominent difference between L6 and L5 was within 1,226 experimentally confirmed human T cell epitopes of MTBC which we downloaded from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, for which the mean <italic>&#x03C0;</italic> for L5 was 0.000063 compared to the 0.000149 estimated for L6, reflecting more than a two-fold difference in diversity (non-overlapping 95&#x0025; CI).</p>

<p>Within L5, there was no difference between the estimated <italic>&#x03C0;</italic> for the T cell epitopes and any of the other functionally categorized genes. However, within L6, genes encoding regulatory proteins and those involved with virulence, detoxification and adaptation were more diverse compared to those for lipid metabolism as well as intermediate metabolism and respiration (non-overlapping 95&#x0025; CI). In addition, genes encoding regulatory proteins were more diverse compared to those involved with lipid metabolism (non-overlapping 95&#x0025; CI).</p>

<title>Different selection pressures within L5 and L6 in human T cell epitopes and regulatory proteins</title>
<p>The average pairwise dN/dS of the concatenates of T cell epitopes as well as genes of the seven other functional categories were calculated for all genomes and compared between L5 and L6. Apart from sequences encoding human T cell epitopes and regulatory proteins that had median average pairwise dN/dS ratios greater than 1.0 in L5 and L6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>, panel a and b), all the remaining functional categories showed a dN/dS ratio of less than 1.0 in both lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary figure S3</xref>).

<title>Conservation of human T cell epitopes of L5 is not affected by patient ethnicity</title>
<p>We previously reported an association between L5 and Ewe patient ethnicity<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Hence to test if conservation of T cell epitopes and/or the diversity of regulatory proteins in L5 was influenced by patient ethnicity, we estimated pairwise dN/dS for sequences encoding T cell epitopes and regulatory proteins of L5 genomes stratified by patient ethnicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>). The median dN/dS of T cell epitopes were all below 1.0 irrespective of patient ethnicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>). However, the median dN/dS of regulatory proteins were marginally above 1.0 among L5 from Ewe TB patients and below 1.0 among L5 from non-Ewe TB patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference between the estimated dN/dS of either the sequences encoding T cell epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>) or regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>) between L5 from TB patients of Ewe and non-Ewe ethnicities.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we compared the largest collection of <italic>Maf</italic> genomes including both L5 and L6 reported so far. We found that, 1) at the whole genome level, L6 had significantly more pairwise nucleotide diversity, higher number of fixed SNPs as well as lower average pairwise SNPs relative to L5, 2) L5 had overall more conserved human T cell epitopes compared to L6, 3) conservation of T cell epitopes in L5 was not influenced by patient ethnicity, and 4) genes encoding regulatory proteins of L5 had lower pairwise nucleotide diversity but a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate than L6.</p>
<p>Our finding that <italic>Maf</italic> L6 has a higher number of fixed SNPs and higher average pairwise SNPs relative to L5 suggests that L6 has diversified more compared to L5 since the emergence of the two lineages<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. This observation is corroborated by the higher genome-wide nucleotide diversity of L6 compared to L5. The higher diversity of L6 might be linked to an earlier emergence. However, recent whole genome-based phytogenies rooted on <italic>Mycobacterium canettii</italic> show that following the branch leading to <italic>Maf</italic> and all animal-adapted members of the MTBC defined by the characteristic deletion in RD9 <sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, L5 branches off much earlier than L6<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Hence, L5 is ancestral to L6, a notion which is also supported by genomic deletion analyses which show that in addition to RD9, L6 and all the animal-adapted members of the MTBC harbor the deletions of RD7, RD8 and RD10<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Hence other factors are likely to account for the higher diversity of L6 compared to L5 in Ghana.</p>
<p><italic>Maf</italic> is highly restricted to West Africa, and thus could be seen as an ecological specialist compared to the other MTBC lineages. Specialists are expected to harbour less diversity across strains compared to generalists<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The observed lower genome-wide nucleotide diversity of L5 hence supports the hypothesis that L5 might be a specialist maintained in West Africa by adaptation to specific human genotypes. In contrast, the higher genome-wide diversity of L6 indicates a generalist pathogen, and hence would have been expected to be globally distributed instead of displaying restriction to West Africa<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The observed diversity of L6 therefore may indicate a pathogen with a wider host range, supporting the hypothesis of maintenance in West Africa by possible environmental or zoonotic reservoir(s). Alternatively, the higher diversity of L6 coupled with the higher number of fixed SNPs could mean that it has a higher intrinsic mutation rate compared to L5.</p>
<p>Even though 90&#x0025; of T cell epitopes were highly conserved in both L5 and L6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>), which is in line with previous reports for the whole MTBC<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, we found T cell epitopes in L5 to exhibit less nucleotide diversity and to be under purifying selection compared to L6. The purifying selection of mutations within L5 is comparable to that reported for the specialist sub-lineages of L4<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, dN/dS within essential genes for survival in macrophages did not differ between L5 and L6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) supporting the notion that the genes in this category perform key functions in both L5 and L6. Since T cell response might partially drive the pathogenesis of TB<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, the relative conservation of T cell epitopes in L5 indicate that it might elicit a more efficient T cell response compared to L6 in its particular host population. This therefore suggests L5 may be a more human-specific pathogen and L6, with significantly more diverse T cell epitopes, a potential opportunistic environmental or zoonotic pathogen. Even though the conserved T cell epitopes of L5 could account for geographical restriction to West Africa and the association with the Ewe ethnicity<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, we found no difference between the diversity of L5 isolated from TB patients of Ewe and those of non-Ewe ethnic backgrounds. The limited number of L5 genomes from Ewe TB patients could possibly account for the lack of observed difference in diversity of T cell epitopes of L5 from TB patients of Ewe and non-Ewe ethnicities, and hence larger sample sizes are required to explore this further. L5 isolated from TB patients of the Ewe ethnicity were shown to be distributed all across the L5 clade of the <italic>Maf</italic> phylogeny instead of clustering in a particular sub-clade (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure S7</xref>). This suggests that, if L5 is indeed maintained in West Africa by its coevolution/adaptation with the Ewe ethnic group of West Africa (Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Benin)<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, there is no specific sub-group of L5 that is responsible for this association but rather the whole of L5.</p>
<p>Members of the MTBC survive in the host mostly by modulation of the host immune response via the action of secretory proteins which form part of regulons controlled by specific regulatory proteins<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In addition, some regulatory proteins are involved in the regulation of transcription and translation of these secretory effectors as well as gene expression of other proteins involved with diverse functions<sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Regulatory proteins in the MTBC hence play an important role in the survival and propagation of the bacteria. Therefore, our finding that regulatory proteins in L5 are under neutral selection (pairwise dN/dS &#x003D; 1.03) compared to L6 in which they appear under purifying selection indicates that the mutations within regulatory proteins might be lineage-specific. This result is comparable to an earlier report comparing mutations within regulatory proteins between <italic>Mtbss</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic>, which found most of the <italic>M. bovis</italic> to harbor majority of the mutations<sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. As mutations within some regulatory proteins have been associated with attenuated virulence<sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, our observation could account for the reported attenuated virulence of <italic>Maf</italic> relative to <italic>Mtbss</italic><sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. This calls for further comparative studies of regulatory proteins between L5, L6 and other MTBC lineages to ascertain the role of regulatory proteins.</p>
<p>Our data is limited by the fact that, the number of L5 genomes was almost 3 times the number of L6 genomes; however, we used 1,000x bootstrap sampling with replacement of both L5 and L6 of equal sample size to limit any possible bias when comparing both lineages due to differences in sample size. In addition, a number of the L5 genomes did not have data on ethnicity and hence affected the number of L5 isolated from patients of the Ewe ethnicity for which we used average estimates of 10 random samples of L5 isolated from patients of non-Ewe origin in comparisons to account for the different sample sizes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that the two <italic>Maf</italic> lineages L5 and L6 are distinct in terms of genomic diversity, and selection pressure on T cell epitopes and regulatory proteins, possibly reflecting different ecological niches. Whereas L5 may be maintained in West Africa by its coevolution or adaptation with native West Africans, L6 may be maintained by an environmental reservoir, possibly a zoonotic source. This genomic analysis of <italic>Maf</italic> from Ghana gives a glimpse of the often neglected diversity within <italic>Maf</italic> and the MTBC overall. More studies are needed from representative genomes of <italic>Maf</italic> from across West Africa to understand the full diversity of these members of the MTBC. Improved knowledge of <italic>Maf</italic> will have implications for our understanding of human TB and the development of better control tools.</p>

<title>DNA Sequencing, Mapping of Sequence Reads, Variance Calling and Generation of Whole Genome Fasta files</title>
<p>Samples were sequenced as multiplexed libraries on the Illumina HiSeq platform to produce paired end reads of 125 nt in length. Genomes provided by the Research Center Borstel was obtained by sequencing DNA libraries prepared with the Nextera XT kit and run on Illumina MiSeq (250 and 300 bp, paired end) and NextSeq (150 bp, paired end) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instruction (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The FastQ files containing the raw paired-end reads were processed using a python pipeline developed in house as follows. The reads were first adapter-and quality-trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.33<sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Reads lower than 20 bp were not kept for the downstream analysis. Overlapping paired-end reads were then merged with SeqPrep (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gthub.comjstjohn/SeqPrep">https://gthub.comjstjohn/SeqPrep</ext-link>). The resulting filtered reads were mapped to a hypothetical reconstructed MTBC ancestor<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> with BWA v0.7.12<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, SNPs were called only if the alternative basecall was supported by at least five reads and without strand bias. All variants were annotated using snpEff v4.11<sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>, in accordance with the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv reference annotation (AL123456.3).

<title>Generation of Variable Positions and Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
<p>The variable SNPs alignment was obtained by concatenating the SNP calls present in the variant calling file of each genome, using the IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity codes for heterozygous calls. A position was considered variable if at least one genome had a SNP at that position. Called deletions and positions not called according to the minimum threshold of 7 were encoded as gaps. Positions for which the proportion of gaps exceeded 50&#x0025; were excluded from the alignment.
