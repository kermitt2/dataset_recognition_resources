<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Kochia scoparia</italic> is a dicotyledonous annual herb and belongs to the Amaranthaceae family. Genetic diversity and resistance to drought stress of this plant has made it widely scattered in different regions which contains highly genetic diversity and great potential as fodder and can grow on salty, drought affected areas. Since the soil salinity has become widely spread. environmental concern has sparked so many debates. An important limiting factor in agricultural production worldwide is the sensitivity of most of the crop to salinity caused by high concentration of salts soil. Plants use three different strategies to prevent and adapt to high Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentrations.

Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporters (NHX1 and SOS1) are located in tonoplasts and reduce cytosolic Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentration by pumping in the vacuole whereas SOS1 is localized at the plasma membrane and extrudes Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in apoplasts. Coding sequence of plasma membrane Na <sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H <sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter (SOS1) and vacuole membrane Na /<sup>&#x002B;</sup>H <sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter (NHX) in <italic>Kochia scoparia</italic> were isolated using conserved sequences of SOS1 and NHX. Also, expression profile under salinity stress was studied in this study. The amino acid sequences (aa) of the isolated region of K.SSOS1 and K.SNHX showed the maximum identity up to 84&#x0025; and 90&#x0025; to its orthologue in salicornia brachiata and suadea maritima, respectively.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most of studies have revealed that the greatest lost in various crop production is due to abiotic stresses, such as, salinity, water deficit, low temperature and heavy metals adversely affect the growth and several physiological processes such as leaf cell growth and biomass production of plants. An important limiting factor in agricultural production worldwide is the sensitivity of most of the crop to salinity caused by high concentration of salts soil. Processes such as seed germination, seedling growth and vigor, vegetative growth, flowering and fruit set are adversely affected by high salt concentration, ultimately causing yield lost. Salinity stress can reduce the productivity of glycophytes, which are the majority of agricultural products. High salt concentrations cause hyper osmotic stress and ion imbalance in plants which often as a secondary effect leads to oxidative damage in cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Qadir, Tubeileh et al. 2008</xref>). Plants adapt to environmental stresses via responses, including the activation of molecular networks that regulate stress perception, signal transduction and the expression of both stress related genes and metabolites (Huang, Ma et al. 2012). Plants have stress specific adaptive responses as well as responses which protect the plants from more than one environmental stress (Huang, Ma et al. 2012). Plants employ three different strategies to prevent and adapt to high Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentrations: 1) active Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> efflux, 2) Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> compartmentalization in vacuoles, and 3) Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> influx prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Niu, Bressan et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rajendran, Tester et al. 2009</xref>). Antiporters are important groups of genes that have a key role in ion homeostasis in plants. Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporters (NHX1 and SOS1) maintain the appropriate concentration of ions in the cytosol, thereby minimizing cytotoxicity. NHX1 are located in tonoplasts and reduce cytosolic Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> concentration by pumping it in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gaxiola, Rao et al. 1999</xref>), whereas SOS1 is localized at the plasma membrane and extrudes Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in apoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shi, Quintero et al. 2002</xref>). Both of these antiporters are driven by a motive proton force generated by the H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumwald, Aharon et al. 2000</xref>). The SOS signaling pathway consists of three major proteins including: SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3. SOS1, which encodes a plasma membrane Na <sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H <sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter, is essential in regulating Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> efflux at the cellular level. It also facilitates long distance transportation of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> from root to shoot. Over expression of this protein leads to salt tolerance in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shi, Ishitani et al. 2000</xref>). Activation of SOS1 by direct phosphorylation of the self-regulation scope is possible by serine/threonine protein kinas or SOS2 that requires calcium binding protein or SOS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Quintero, Martinez-Atienza et al. 2011</xref>). C-terminal end of the protein causes the Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> to move. At the C-terminal end, SOS1, the 764 849 region is cyclic nucleotide-binding site and in the 998 -1146 region a self-regulator domain exists. In the respite state the self-regulator domain interacts with upstream sequence bearing the cyclic nucleotide-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Quintero, Martinez-Atienza et al. 2011</xref>). In fact, the self-regulator domain is a target location for phosphorylation by SOS2. After SOS1 phosphorylation, the self-regulator domain leaves upstream location and attaches at this location of cyclic nucleotide and transferring protein activity begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Quintero, Martinez-Atienza et al. 2011</xref>). According to the above mentioned information, domain connected to the cyclic nucleotide can be used as one of the most important locations to regulate SOS1 activity, eventually its effect on salinity tolerance.</p>
<p><italic>K.scoparia</italic>, a dicotyledonous erect annual herb belongs to Amaranthaceae family with high genetic diversity and great foliage potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mullinex 1998</xref>), reported that <italic>K scoparia</italic> on of its Iranian variety is highly tolerant to salt and could be considered as a foliage species in cold regions of the world. Rapid vegetative growth under high salinity and temperature and drought and stress makes it a very valuable candidate as a non-conventional foliage crop for arid temperate regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kafi, Asadi et al. 2010</xref>). <italic>K scoparia</italic> has been widely used in Chinese and Korean traditional medicine as a treatment for skin diseases, diabetes, mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, liver disorders, and jaundice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi, Lee et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kim, Lee et al. 2005</xref>). Kochia seeds contain an ovi position pheromone that can be added as an attractant for mosquito pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Whitney, Sayanova et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Friesen, Beckie et al. 2009</xref>). It has been reported that seeds of Kochia also contain other chemicals that could be beneficial for human, such as compounds used in ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis, treatmeant and some pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Friesen, Beckie et al. 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Friesen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goyal and Gupta, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borrelli and Izzo, 2000</xref>). The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of SOS1 and NHX1 genes and trace it using by induced salt stress in <italic>Kochia scoparia</italic>, Futures of these genes in protein structure characterized with in silico tools.

<title>Results and Discussions</title>
<p>In this research, isolation of the coding sequence of plasma membrane Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> /H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>antiporter (SOS1) and vacuolar membrane Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> /H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchanger (NHX) in Kochia scparia was performed and, the consequence of salinity stress was studied on the expression profile of this gene. We focused on SOS1 and NHX the critical genes in the SOS pathway and vacuolar membrane for the resistant to salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The SOS pathway and vacuolar membrane Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchanger (NHX) are currently the most extensively studied mechanisms in controlling the salt stress response in plants. The SOS and vacuolar membrane Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> /H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchanger (NHX) pathway is responsible for ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in plants.</p>

<title>Conserved domains, homology and phylogenetic analyses of SOS1 and NHX in <italic>K.scoparia</italic></title>
<p>After sequencing the coding SOS1 and NHX genes sequences in <italic>K.scoparia</italic>, Conserved domain specified using of NCBI revealed that putative protein SOS1 belongs to the Sodium/hydrogen exchanger family; These antiporters contain 10-12 trans membrane regions (M) at the amino-terminus and a large cytoplasm region at the carboxyl terminus. The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share the same identity with other members of the which family. The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is believed to be the region involved in the transportation of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasm region has little similarity throughout the family. Conserved domain Analysis for NHX showed that family represents five transmembrane helices. This suggests that the paired regions form a ten helical structure, probably forming the pore, whereas the binds a ligand for export or regulation of the pore. The development of intracellular membrane systems and compartments has led to a considerable increase in the number of ion transporters in eukaryote cells. As a result, plants contain a large number of sequences encoding proteins that share homology to Na/H antiporters which are key transporters in maintaining the pH of actively metabolizing cells. According to highly similar sequences (Mega Blast) search for sequence homology of SOS1 and NHX genes in the NCBI data base on Table3 was provided. Maximum identity up to90&#x0025; with Suadeamaritimaof NHX gene and for SOS1 gene is 84&#x0025; by Salicorniabrachiata.</p>

<p>Studies have identified salt tolerance determinants in organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to fungi and from algae to higher plants. In plant cell maintain a high K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in the cytoplasm, under normal conditions. Under salt stress conditions plants have several strategies and adaptive mechanisms for tolerant to these conditions. In these mechanisms, to be launched sensing, signal transduction, gene expression and metabolic pathways. Evidence may be these tolerance progarms slow and steady adapatation in the sensitives plants. Therefore, understanding the components of these mechanisms in halophytes can do contribute substantially to improving retrofitting sensitive plants.We focused on isolation, characterization and gene expression pattern analysis of main genes involved in salinity tolerance in halophytes from <italic>K.scoparia.</italic> In the present study, the relatively high basal expression level of V-NHX indicated the important physiological function of NHX in <italic>K.scoparia</italic>, even in the absence of stress NHX levels positively have correlation with salinity levels. In other words, compared to control <italic>K.scoparia</italic> like most halophytes leaves progressively increases under salinity stress. Amounts of mRNA increased for NHX gene: 1 and 2 times higher than the control (0mM) in 150 and 300mM stressed plants after 48 h of exposure respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), The higher NHX1 expression in the leaves was a prompt response to NaCl treatment which could have helped decrease the Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> content in the cytoplasm and maintain water concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Khedr, Serag et al. 2011</xref>).Previously transgenic studies have shown that the over expression of the NHX1 gene significantly enhanced plant salt tolerance abilities, in transgenic Arabidopsis over expressing AtNHX1, higher activities of the vacuolar Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter were observed and enabling it to grow in the presence of 200 mMNaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Apse, Aharon et al. 1999</xref>). The over expression of the cotton Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter gene GhNHX1 in tobacco improved salt tolerance in comparison with wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wu, Yang et al. 2004</xref>). Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter is an important membrane protein responsible for pumping Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> into the vacuole to reduce Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> toxicity and alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wu, Yang et al. 2004</xref>).The expression of the K.s SOS1 gene in L. fusca was regulated by Na <sup>&#x002B;</sup> and to characterize the engagement of SOS1 in kochia response to saline conditions, results showed that a basal level of <italic>K.scoparia</italic> SOS1 transcripts in plants without salt stress, which up-regulated significantly with salt treatments. amounts of mRNA increased for SOS1 gene and NHX in roots plant but less than the increase in leaves, once and towice times for SOS1, 0.5 and 1 time higher than the control in 150 and 300mM treated plants. These results are in agreement with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Oh et al. 2009</xref>, report about the increase of the SOS1 expression level in response to salt treatments in A. thalianaand T. halophila. It has been reported that A. thaliana AtSOS1is expressed at low basal levels but is up-regulated significantly by salt stress in both roots and shoots. Moreover, it regulates other genes in response to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shi et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gong et al. 2001</xref>). Based on the conducted docking; there is a possibility of hydrogen and hydrophobic connection in the porous structure. The amino acid phenylalanine, lysine, threonine, glycine and arginine have the most connection and positioning in the porous structure according to their charge, polar, non-polar and structure features. Meanwhile, the conserved glycine amino acids, which are involved in the formation of pore-like structure, are also effective in hydrophobic connections,With further investigation on this domain, these factors affecting it can be determined. In the other plants antiporter activity, long cytosolic C-Terminal tail of SOS1 in thought to be involved in the sensing of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (She et al., 2000). Furthermore SOS1 has been demonstrated to be a target of SOS pathway, releationships between SOS1 and SOS2/SOS3 can be a way of regulating the activity of SOS1. Ceratin domains of SOS1 reacted with SOS2/SOS3 that charectrization of these domains can be helped to the use of this protein in process will creat resistance plants. To provide factors will be affected the SOS1 activity and to determine suitable methods to activate these proteins in Glycophyt plant. On the other NHX exchanger acts as a mediator of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> taransport between cytosol and vacoule, SOS2 also activates the vacuolar-ATP as e and vacuolar Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> antiporter NHX exchangers, which compartmentalizations Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> into vacuoles. K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> compartmentalization in the vacuole coulad result in a cytosolic K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> deficiency(Zhang et al., 2014). So determine how to communicate this antiporters can be controlled out ways of increasing salt tolerance to be properly. Sequencing of SOS2 and prediction of interact with NHX can be used for controling of SOS pathway.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the my study SOS1 and NHX genes sequenced and determind Proteins characteristics with insilico tools. Charecterization of other genes involved these pathways and signaling pathway and investigation invitro of proteins are apromising area of research that may lead to improvments in the biomass production of crop with external applications materials and genetic manipulation.</p>
