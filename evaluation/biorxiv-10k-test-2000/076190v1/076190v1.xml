<title>Abstract</title>
<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are integrated parts of the developmental toolkit in animals. The evolutionary history and origins of animal miRNAs is however unclear, and it is not known when they evolved and on how many occasions. We have therefore investigated the presence of miRNAs and the necessary miRNA biogenesis machinery in a large group of unicellular relatives of animals, Ichthyosporea. By small RNA sequencing we find evidence for at least four genes in the genus <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> that satisfy the criteria for the annotation of animal miRNA genes. Three of these miRNAs are conserved and expressed across sphaeroformid species. Furthermore, we identify homologues of the animal miRNA biogenesis genes across a wide range of ichthyosporeans, including <italic>Drosha</italic> and <italic>Pasha</italic> which make up the animal specific Microprocessor complex. Taken together we report the first evidence for <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNA genes and the presence of the miRNA-processing pathway in unicellular Choanozoa, implying that the origin of animal miRNAs and the Microprocessor complex predates multicellular animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20&#x2013;26 nucleotides) RNA molecules that are involved in gene regulation ADD SEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromm, 2016</xref>). They are found in a wide variety of organisms including plants, viruses and animals but current evidence does not support a common evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tarver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2006;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shabalina and Koonin, 2016</xref>). In animals, miRNAs are essential components of the gene regulatory machinery and highly important for processes like cell differentiation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mello and Conte, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, because of the increase of distinct miRNA families during animal evolution (combined with lineage specific expansions and rare losses), miRNAs have been linked to the evolution of morphological complexity in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berezikov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wheeler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kosik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fromm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Erwin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Philippe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Mainly based on the absence of miRNAs in single-celled ancestors, it has even been proposed that miRNAs were one of the key factors that allowed multicellular animals to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wheeler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mattick, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, the primary transcripts of miRNA genes (pri-miRNA) can be very long RNA molecules that contain hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Axtell et al. 2011</xref>; Ameres &#x0026; Zamore 2013; Chang et al. 2015). In animals, the so-called Microprocessor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), comprising the RNase III enzyme Drosha and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein Pasha (known as DGCR8 in humans), subsequently excises the hairpin structures (creating the pre-miRNA). In contrast, plants do not possess Drosha or Pasha proteins; here, several copies of the nuclear RNase III protein Dicer fulfills the role of the Microprocessor. In both animals and plants, the loop region of the hairpin pre-miRNA is subsequently removed by Dicer proteins, albeit dicing takes place in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, resulting in a 20&#x2013;26 nt dsRNA molecule. Typically, only one of these strands (known as the mature strand) is then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), while the other strand (the passenger, or star strand) is degraded. Gene regulation takes place via the RISC and the central component, the Argonaute (AGO) protein that binds the mature miRNA. Target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are identified by basepairing between the loaded miRNAs and the mRNA, and translation of the mRNA is either fully blocked or down regulated.</p>
<p>In animals, miRNA genes have been found even in the early diverging animal lineages such as sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wheeler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In fact, only two animal lineages are known to be missing miRNAs, the ctenophores and Placozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimson et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moroz et al. 2014</xref>). However, due to the lack of homologous miRNA sequences in the basal branching animals, it has been hypothesized that miRNA genes in animals arose several times independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tarver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although, except from one study sequencing the small RNA content of the choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimson et al. 2008</xref>), almost nothing is known about the presence of miRNA genes, or the biogenesis machinery, in the unicellular relatives of animals.</p>
<p>Here, we therefore investigate whether miRNA genes coevolved with animal multicellularity or if these genes were present already in the unicellular ancestors of animals, the choanozoans. We address this question by deep sequencing of smallRNAs from species belonging to Ichthyosporea; a basal group at the split between animals and fungi, and search for the animal miRNA biogenesis machinery in all unicellular relatives of animals. Our results show the existence of six miRNA genes in <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> that fulfill all criteria for the annotation of metazoan miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fromm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Three of the miRNAs are highly conserved and expressed across three species, which strongly indicate that the genes have important and similar function. In addition, we show that the genomes of several species of Ichthyosporea, covering the genera <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic>, <italic>Creolimax</italic>, <italic>Pirum</italic>, <italic>Abeoforma</italic> and <italic>Amoebidium</italic> contain homologs of the animal <italic>Pasha</italic> and <italic>Drosha</italic> genes as well as <italic>Dicer</italic>, <italic>Exportin 5</italic> and <italic>AGO</italic>.</p>
<p>Altogether we present an evolutionary scenario where the common ancestor of Choanozoa and animals (Holozoan ancestor) already possessed the animal miRNA biogenesis pathway, including <italic>Drosha</italic> and <italic>Pasha,</italic> as well as <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs. This implies that both the animal miRNAs and the Microprocessor pre-date the origin of animals and that the last common ancestor of animals likely used miRNAs for gene regulation.</p>

<title>Sphaeroforma species have bona fide miRNA genes</title>
<p>Initially, our small RNA sequencing and bioinformatics pipeline identified six miRNA genes in <italic>Sphaeroforma arctica</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary File 1). Five of the miRNAs fulfilled all of the recently proposed criteria for the annotation of miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fromm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>); at least two 20&#x2013;26 nt RNA strands are expressed from each of the two arms that are derived from a hairpin precursor with 2-nt offsets (note that the 1nt Drosha-offset of Sar-Mir-Nov-3 and the 1nt Dicer-offset of Sar-Mir-Nov-5 are both likely due to the low number of reads in general and correspondingly lower read-counts of the star sequence). Further, the reads on both arms show no or very little variation of their 5&#x2032; start positions (5&#x2032; homogeneity) and we observe at least 16 complementary nucleotides between the two arms. We include here Sar-Mir-Nov-6, although the star strand is not expressed and thus Dicer or Drosha offsets cannot be assessed because it shows high expression, a good structure and is located close to Sar-Mir-Nov-5 forming a polycistronic miRNA. The loop sizes are quite variable and Sar-Mir-Nov-5 has the smallest loop size of 36 nts. Sar-Mir-Nov-1, 2 and 4 are slightly larger with 42, 41 and 43 nts respectively, while Sar-Mir-Nov-3 and Sar-Mir-Nov-6 are considerably bigger with loop sizes of 59 and 60 nucleotides.</p>

<p>The expression of the primary miRNA transcripts is confirmed by transcription start site (TSS) and mRNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref>). Using the same pipeline on <italic>S. sirkka</italic> we identified four of the <italic>S. arctica</italic> miRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary File 1). No other additional miRNAs were found in <italic>S. sirkka.</italic> Because there is no genome available for <italic>S. napiecek</italic> we could not run the miRNA prediction tools as for the other species. But we could identify five of the <italic>S. arctica</italic> pre-miRNAs among the expressed mRNAs (even though the pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and hence is poly-adenylated, it might not be present among the mRNAs because of rapid processing by Drosha and Dicer). These pre-miRNAs also had small RNA reads mapping to the same locations as the mature and star strands in <italic>S. arctica</italic>, except for the star region of Sar-Mir-Nov-3 and 5. The pre-miRNAs were highly conserved between the three species with most mutations in the loop region which does not affect the gene targeting. But there were also a few minor differences in the mature and star strands, most notably in Sar-Mir-Nov-2. None of the novel miRNAs had any detectable homologs outside of Ichthyosporea.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The miRNA genes are either located in intergenic regions or in the introns and UTRs of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref>). In <italic>S. arctica</italic> Sar-Mir-Nov-1, 3, 5 and 6 are encoded in intergenic regions and transcribed as &#x003E; 1kb unspliced pri-miRNA fragments with a well-defined TSS, except for Sar-Mir-Nov-3 which is lacking a TSS but this is probably an artifact of the genome assembly. Interestingly, the region covering the Sar-Mir-Nov-5 pri-miRNA is transcribed also from the opposite strand which could represent a potential novel long non-coding RNA with binding capacity to the miRNA (an miRNA sponge) as no protein-coding gene is annotated in the region. Sar-Mir-Nov-2 and Sar-Mir-Nov-4 are encoded within protein coding genes, in the intron and the 3&#x2032;-UTR respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1</xref>). These miRNAs are not transcribed from a separate TSS, but instead co-transcribed with the protein-coding gene and subsequently processed into the mature miRNAs. It is worth noting that these miRNAs are located within the <italic>Drosha</italic> and <italic>Argonaute</italic> genes, indicating a possible co-evolution of the miRNAs and the miRNA processing genes.</p>

<title>The S. arctica genome contains both plant- and animal-type miRNA targets</title>
<p>In animals, mRNA targets in 3&#x2032;-UTRs, so called miRNA response elements (MREs) are usually recognized by short seed regions (7 nts) of the mature strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartel, 2009</xref>). As a consequence, target prediction is highly uncertain. Showing that putative miRNA target sequences are conserved in homologous target genes between species increases the probability that a true miRNA target is found, but needs to be verified experimentally. However, such conserved target sequences are not available from <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> and thus could not be included as input to the target prediction algorithm. Still, many potential target genes in the <italic>S. arctica</italic> genome were identified for all the miRNAs using the TargetScan program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) with a context&#x002B; score cutoff of &#x2212;0.2 as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jacobsen <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>.</p>
<p>We additionally searched for plant-like miRNA targets in the <italic>S. arctica</italic> transcriptome using the TAPIR web server (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonnet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Plant-like targets require a near-perfect basepairing along the whole length of the mature miRNA sequence and are thus much less likely to be an artifact. For Sar-Mir-Nov-3 we identified one gene with a plant-like target mode which is clearly homologous to an ABC transporter. Sar-Mir-Nov-4 also targets a single gene. This gene has no conserved domains but a weak Blast hit against the RED1 gene from yeast, a gene required for chromosome segregation during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Thompson and Roeder, 1989</xref>). For Sar-Mir-Nov-5 and 6 we identified three target genes with a plant-like target mode. These three genes are likely paralogs as they share significant sequence similarity (including 13 additional homologs in the <italic>S. arctica</italic> genome, data not shown). These three genes are all zinc-finger transcription factors.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ichthyosporea species harbor key elements of the animal miRNA processing machinery</title>
<p>We used reciprocal Blast searches and domain detection tools to identify genes related to the Microprocessor and RNAi machinery. We used all available Choanozoa genomes and transcriptomes, including the new transcriptomes generated in this study. The genes we searched for were <italic>Argonaute</italic> (<italic>AGO</italic>), <italic>Dicer</italic>, <italic>Drosha</italic>, <italic>Pasha</italic>, and <italic>Exportin 5</italic> (<italic>XPO5</italic>). Besides <italic>XPO5,</italic> which was detected in all opisthokont lineages, the choanoflagellates and filastereans seems to be lacking all key genes involved in miRNA processing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). No Argonaute of the <italic>AGO</italic> subfamily (with the signature PAZ and PIWI domains) was detected, likewise no <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Drosha</italic> gene, nor <italic>Pasha</italic> was detected. Importantly however, these genes were all detected in most of the ichthyosporean species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and S3). The annotated <italic>Dicer</italic>/<italic>Drosha</italic> genes contained two consecutive RNaseIII domains, which is a unique feature of <italic>Dicer</italic> and <italic>Drosha</italic> genes (Supplementary File 2 and Supplementary Information) revealing that both types of genes may be present (a few short genes identified as either <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Drosha</italic> by the Blast annotation pipeline covered only a single RNase III domain likely due to incomplete assembly).</p>

<p>To better distinguish the RNase III-containing genes as either <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Drosha</italic> we reconstructed a phylogeny with known Drosha and Dicer protein homologs from multiple animals and fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The resulting tree revealed a highly supported and distinct clades of Dicer (89&#x0025; Maximum Likelihood (ML) bootstrap support and 1.0 Bayesian posterior probability (BP), hereafter ML/BP) and Drosha (81&#x0025;/1.0). Within this framework, the ichthyosporean sequences were divided into several smaller clades that where phylogenetically related to both the Dicer and Drosha branches, supporting the gene annotation that both <italic>Dicer</italic> and <italic>Drosha</italic> genes are present in these species. In addition, there were several paralogs of both Dicer and Drosha among Ichthyosporeans, revealing several duplications of the genes, but unsupported phylogenetic relationships between these preclude an interpretation of the number of gene expansions and losses.</p>

<title>MicroRNAs are present in unicellular relatives of animals</title>
<p>Here we have sequenced the expressed small RNAs of three choanozoan species and for the first time shown evidence of miRNAs in unicellular relatives of animals. These miRNAs show all the characteristics of typical miRNAs, such as being transcribed from a structured miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA), processing by two consecutive Drosha and Dicer cuts that leave characteristic 2-nt 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; overhangs and 5&#x2032; homogeneous small RNA reads mapping to both the mature and star strands of the miRNAs. Four of the six novel miRNAs are highly conserved between the <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> species we have investigated. Conservation has earlier been one of the criteria for defining miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ambros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and together with expression and the canonical folding structure this strongly indicate functional miRNA genes. Conservation of miRNAs across species has also been used as a criterion for the identification of novel miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ambros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Only one of the newly detected miRNAs is within the typical range of animal miRNA loop sizes of up to 40 nts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fromm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), while three others are only slightly above this observed threshold. However, two of the miRNAs have significantly larger loop sizes and resemble more those observed in animals with at least two separate Dicer genes, including plants, demosponges, pancrustacean arthropods, and flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">De Jong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In an attempt to hone in on the function of these miRNAs we predicted their potential target genes in <italic>S. arctica</italic> which is the only species for which an annotation of the 3&#x2032;-UTRs is available. Surprisingly, the predicted targeting mode of the miRNAs seems to be a mixture of animal- and plant-like mechanisms. For all the miRNAs we could easily identify several tens to more than hundred genes potentially targeted with an animal-type mechanism. And intriguingly, for the two miRNAs with longer loops (i.e. more plant-like) we could also identify several genes targeted in a plant-like manner. These targets were very different types of genes. Some of them have no recognizable homologs in public databases and could therefore be specific to <italic>S. arctica</italic>. One was homologous to an ABC transporter, which are ubiquitous among eukaryotes. And lastly, different paralogs of Zinc-finger transcription factors seem to be regulated by these miRNAs. These miRNAs may therefore have important regulatory functions by acting on transcription factors in ichthyosporeans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, protocols and tools for assessing these regulatory functions by experimental approaches are obstructed by lack of appropriate molecular tools for <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, our results suggest that there is potentially a wide range of target genes in the genome of the unicellular Choanozoa reflecting the broad regulatory roles of the miRNA genes.</p>

<title>Essential components of the miRNA protein machinery present in Ichthyosporea</title>
<p>The ichthyosporean miRNAs discovered here have all characteristics of being processed by double RNase III domain proteins because they have 2-nt 3&#x2032; overhangs and small RNAs that map to the mature and star strands of the pre-miRNAs. But until now <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Drosha</italic>, as well as other key components of the animal miRNA biogenesis machinery, have not been identified in any ichthyosporean or other choanozoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We therefore re-examined available genome and transcriptome data from all choanozoans and identified <italic>Pasha</italic>, <italic>XPO5</italic> and <italic>AGO</italic> in all ichthyosperans investigated, as well as several genes that were either class II or III RNases which comprise <italic>Dicer</italic> and <italic>Drosha</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nicholson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kwon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Strikingly, the phylogenetic annotation shows that all the ichthyosproreans harbor at last one copy, but more often several copies, of an RNase III gene which is more closely related to <italic>Drosha</italic> than <italic>Dicer.</italic> Drosha has previously only been found in animals and is believed to have evolved from Dicer, which is ubiquitous among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kwon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In addition, homologs of the animal Dicer gene were identified in most ichthyosporeans.</p>
<p>The phylogenetic distribution of the <italic>Dicer</italic> and <italic>Drosha</italic> sequences reveal another pattern specific to the two closely related genera <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> and <italic>Creolimax</italic>: Both possess two distinct subfamilies of <italic>Drosha</italic> that are exclusive to these groups. To our knowledge this is the first example of multiple copies of Drosha in a species.</p>

<title>The Microprocessor complex evolved in ancient unicellular relatives of animals</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that miRNAs and a miRNA biogenesis pathway homologous to that in animals was innovated much earlier than in the last common ancestor of animals. This includes the animal-specific Microprocessor complex with Drosha and Pasha; in fact, these two genes are always found together. Our discovery of both Pasha and Drosha in all ichthyosporeans investigated suggests that the Microprocessor complex predates animals and was present already in the early history of opisthokonts. In contrast, no sign of the Microprocessor components was found in fungi or any basal Holomycota species. Altogether this suggest that the Microprocessor complex originated in Holozoa after the separation from Holomycota, but before Ichthyosporea diverged from the other choanozoan lineages.</p>
<p>This also implies that the absence of the Microprocessor complex, and miRNAs, in the deeply diverging comb jellies (ctenophores) must be a secondary loss. Hence it is not a primitive state argued to confirm their basal positon in the animal phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Similarly, no member of the other two main Holozoa groups, the choanoflagellates and filastereans, show any signs of miRNAs or the Microprocessor machinery implying that they have independently lost these genes. Altogether therefore, the deep holozoan origin of the Microprocessor complex and miRNA genes has been followed by multiple independent losses.</p>
<p>Previously, nearly all classes of transcription factors, signaling and adhesion proteins in animals have been discovered among their unicellular relatives (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Shalchian-Tabrizi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Seb&#x00E9;-Pedr&#x00F3;s and Ruiz-Trillo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Suga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Richter and King, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">King <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Hence most of the genetic components required for complex multicellular organisms were innovated among unicellular sisters of animals. Here, we provide the first evidence that also the regulatory RNAs essential for animal gene regulation and development pre-date the origin of animals, suggesting that the last common ancestor of animals had miRNAs and the capacity of gene regulation by such small regulatory RNAs.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Single origin and multiple losses of animal miRNAs</title>
<p>Animal miRNAs are believed to have originated at multiple occasions because sponge miRNAs are not conserved between silicisponges (demosponges &#x002B; hexactinellids), calcisponges and homoscleromorphs, nor with other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liew <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wheeler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tarver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, 2015). According to this scenario, eumetazoan miRNAs are not homologs of sponge miRNAs and the last common ancestor of animals did not possess miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tarver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Maxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moroz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the presence of the Microprocessor complex and the accompanying large variety of miRNA types in Ichthyosporea makes it likely that the ancestor of Holozoa and animals contained a variety of miRNA types. Hence, deviating animal miRNAs in the sponges may represent residuals of the ancient choanozoan genes instead of being genetic innovations. Accordingly, dissimilar miRNA types in the sponge lineages can be result of differential loss of the ancestral miRNAs.</p>
<p>The finding of conserved miRNAs outside of animals therefore changes how we view the evolution of miRNAs and their potential key role in the transition to complex multicellular animals. The striking similarities in the miRNA biogenesis machinery across the animal kingdom, which now also extends to include ichthyosporeans, argue for a common origin of the machinery and the capacity to process miRNAs that predates the animals. Hence the timing of the genetic innovations <italic>per se</italic> of the miRNAs in animals cannot longer be directly linked to the origin of multicellularity and complexity among animals.</p>

<title>Identification of genes related to the miRNA processing machinery</title>

Accession numbers of the query genes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Table S3</xref>.</p>
<p>Genes were identified using a reciprocal Blast strategy and domain identification.

<p>Domain annotation was performed using InterProScan and we defined miRNA-related genes on the basis of the identified domains as following: AGO: both PAZ and PIWI domains present, Dicer and Drosha: two RNase III domains present, Pasha: double stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). XPO5 contains no conserved domains and was only identified with the reciprocal Blast strategy. For a few <italic>Dicer</italic> and <italic>Drosha</italic> sequences identified by reciprocal Blast, only a a single RNase III domain was identified with InterProScan.

<title>Identification of Dicer and Drosha RNase III domains in Ichthyosporeans</title>
<p>Only two gene families contain double RNase III domains and these comprise the Drosha and Dicer and genes (i.e. class II and III of the RNAase III gene family; Kwon et al). For some putative ichthyosporean <italic>Dicer</italic>/<italic>Drosha</italic> homologs, conventional domain search tools such as Pfam or CD-search identified only one RNase III domain located in the C-terminal region. We therefore aligned the sequences to the RNase III a and b domains of other animal and fungal Dicers and Drosha proteins, as well as the bacterial <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> RNase III domain (names and accession numbers in Supplementary File 2). The alignment was done by splitting the sequences into parts consisting of only the RNaseIII a or b domain. For sequences without an annotated RNaseIII domain these putative domains were identified by aligning the sequence to the annotated domains of the <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>N. vectensis</italic> Dicer and Drosha sequences. Then all RNaseIII a and b domains were aligned together. All alignments were done using Mafft v.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Katoh and Toh, 2010</xref> with the L-INS-I algorithm with the BLOSUM45 scoring matrix. The alignment revealed that the RNase III a domain is much more divergent than the RNase III b domain, confirming earlier reports (Shi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006). Nevertheless it shows clear homology of the RNase III b domain for all ichthyosporean Dicer/Drosha sequences, and reveal homologous regions in the RNase III a domain, including residues in the highly important signature motif (Ji, 2008).</p>

<p>Mapping of smallRNAs (blue track), mRNAs (green track) and transcription start site (TSS) reads (red and orange tracks) at the genomic regions surrounding the miRNAs in <italic>Sphaeroforma arctica</italic>. &#x002A;For Supercontig_1.420 we merged Supercontig_1.3651 which contain the middle domain of AGO and are expressed together in the transcriptome. Note that Sar-Mir-Nov-3 is lacking a TSS but this is probably an artifact of the genome assembly (the contig is very short and the mRNAs map almost from beginning to the end).</p></caption>

<p>Genes in <italic>Sphaeroforma arctica</italic> targeted by the novel miRNAs in a plant-like manner. Genes annotated using Geneious R9 by running InterProScan, and Blastp searches against NCBI RefSeq database (with BLOSUM45 scoring matrix) and the UniprotKB/Swiss-prot database. Only Blast hits with an e-value &#x003C; 0.05 are shown. And in cases where the top his was an un-annotated gene, the best hitting annotate gene is shown. Hits against <italic>S. arctica</italic> genes in RefSeq are not reported.</p></caption>
