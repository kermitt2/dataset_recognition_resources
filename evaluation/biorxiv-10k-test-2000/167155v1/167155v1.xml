<title>Abstract</title>
<p>During development, cell-generated forces induce tissue-scale deformations to shape the organism. Here, we present a method that allows to quantitatively relate such tissue-scale deformations to spatially localized forces and measure mechanical properties of epithelia <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our approach is based on the application of controlled forces on microparticles embedded in individual cells of an embryo. Combining measurements of the bead displacement with the analysis of induced deformation fields in a continuum mechanics framework, we can quantify tissue material properties and follow their change over time. In particular, we uncover a rapid change in tissue response occurring during <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellularization, resulting from a softening of the blastoderm and an increase of external friction. Pharmacological treatments reveal that in addition to actomyosin, the microtubule cytoskeleton is a major contributor to epithelial mechanics at that stage. Overall, our method allows for measuring essential mechanical parameters governing tissue-scale deformations and flows occurring during morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During animal development, cell-generated forces, which are modulated in space and time, are translated into tissue-scale deformations that shape the living organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Petridou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Rauzi et al., 2015</xref>). The extent and pattern of these deformations depends not solely on the temporal and spatial profile of the generated force fields but also on the mechanical properties of tissues that the force acts on. For instance, when a thin sheet of elastic material moves with friction relative to an external substrate, the range of deformation triggered by an external force is larger in a stiffer elastic material. It is thus conceivable that, similar to cell-generated forces, the mechanical properties of tissues are modulated during development in order to drive morphogenesis towards specific developmental endpoints. However, the direct assessment of the material properties governing tissue-scale deformation in living organism is challenging, as it requires the application of controlled ectopic forces and the concurrent measurement of epithelial deformation within developing embryos. Recent approaches have started to develop methodologies to apply controlled forces employing tissue-embedded (ferromagnetic) fluid droplets combined with force application by means of a magnetic field or by trapping cell contacts with optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bambardekar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Campas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Serwane et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the applied force amplitudes, however, droplet movements as well as tissue deformations reached with these experimental techniques remain highly localized, thus hindering the accessibility of mechanical properties emerging on the tissue scale. Here, we present a method overcoming this limitation. In the spirit of previous <italic>in vitro</italic> methods, we make use of a micron-sized functionalized magnetic particle that is pulled on by means of a custom made electromagnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bausch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kollmannsberger and Fabry, 2007</xref>). Due to the high force amplitudes available within our assay, large bead displacements and, in particular, large-scale tissue deformations can be induced. We show that quantifying the tissue response to force application on the bead allows to characterize key tissue mechanical properties. Importantly, we do not only monitor bead displacement, but also quantify tissue deformation based on image-segmentation data. By analyzing the deformation field within a continuum mechanics framework, quantitative insights into global mechanical tissue properties can be obtained. In particular, we show that a rapid change in tissue mechanics occurs during cellularization on time-scales of as little as several minutes. Using drug treatments, we find that in addition to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, microtubules also contribute to the material properties of the syncytial blastoderm. Finally, we detect changes in the friction coefficient that correlate with changes in the distance between the blastoderm and the vitellin envelope, indicating that friction is modulated on short time scales during development.</p>

<title>Magnetic particle injection and positioning</title>
<p>We have developed a protocol for injecting an individual magnetic microparticle into a living <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and for a consecutive embedding of the particle into a tissue of interest: (i) a magnetic bead with a diameter of 4.5 <italic>&#x03BC;m</italic> is injected into the embryo at preblastoderm stage, (ii) the bead is then directed with a permanent magnet towards the surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The bead is afterwards encapsulated within an individual cell while cellularization occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and see Material and methods). The cell accommodates to the embedded bead and the organism develops normally until larval stage (Video 1). By choosing the orientation of the embryo during the steering phase, we can ensure the bead to be encapsulated in predefined groups of cells that will develop into specific tissues at a later stage. In particular, we were able to incorporate magnetic beads in the blastoderm at early stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and in the epidermis and amnioserosa at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). To specifically target intracellular compartments, the microparticle was coated with a GFP nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kubala et al., 2010</xref>), which specifically binds GFP-tagged proteins. In particular, in order to attach the bead to the cell surface, we made use of fly lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of Resille, a membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Morin et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Bead displacement and deformation field measurements upon force application</title>
<p>After calibration (see Material and methods), we applied a controlled force step of 65s duration and amplitudes taking values around 115pN to the magnetic bead by means of an electromagnet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure1-figure supplement 1A-B</xref>, Suppl. Info. and Material and methods). We obtained two complementary readouts in order to characterize the mechanical response of the tissue: (i) the bead displacement over time and (ii) the deformation field of the apical surface area of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, see Material and methods).</p>
<p>Applying forces at consecutive times in the blastoderm, spanning a period of 50 min before gastrulation of Resille-GFP expressing embryos, we can observe significant changes in both the displacement of the bead and the induced deformation field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>, video 2 and video 3). Defining the origin of time as the onset of gastrulation, we find that the amplitude of bead displacement, i.e. the maximal displacement of the bead at the end of the force step relative to its position before the force step, changes abruptly from approximately 2 <italic>&#x03BC;m</italic> to 8 <italic>&#x03BC;m</italic> around t=-20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This change in maximal bead displacement is associated with a concurrent change in the spatial profile and range of the deformation field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure1-figure supplement 1-D</xref>). Our data therefore show that the same localized force can lead to a significantly different deformation pattern when applied at developmental time points differing only by a few minutes.</p>

<title>Spring dashpot analysis shows a fast mechanical switch during cellularization</title>
<p>To obtain a first mechanical description of the response of the tissue upon force indentation, we analyzed bead responses by means of an effective rheological model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that the response to a force step could be well captured by fitting a viscoelastic Maxwell-Kelvin-Voigt model to the individual bead displacement curves. In this mechanical circuit, a viscous element, with viscosity coefficient <italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sub>1</sub>, acts in parallel with an elastic element, with stiffness coefficient <italic>K</italic>, both operating in series with a viscous element described by a second viscosity coefficient <italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In such a rheological scheme, the long time behavior is a fluid relaxation occurring on a timescale dictated by the ratio of the viscosity parameter <italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sub>2</sub> to the stiffness coefficient <italic>K</italic>. Introducing a long-time viscous response was necessary to account for the incomplete relaxation of the bead after the application of the force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which indicates that the tissue does not behave like a purely elastic material on long time scales.</p>

<p>We determined the effective parameters introduced above for 20 force application experiments, performed at successive time points during cellularization, the process during which cellular membranes extend basally towards the interior part of the embryo(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Figard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Royou et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Plotting them as a function of developmental time reveals a rapid step-like change of all three mechanical parameters, occurring at -17 min before the onset of gastrulation. Indeed, we found that the observed time-courses could be well fitted by sigmoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The effective viscoelastic timescales, <italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>K</italic> and <italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sub>2</sub>/<italic>K</italic>, in contrast, did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref>). This observation indicates that both elasticity and viscosities change in the same extent, suggesting that these two parameters are not independent from each other. The observed switch in mechanical parameters coincides with a change in the velocity of progression of cellularization(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Figard et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). We therefore refer to the phases before and after the change in mechanical parameters as early and late cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of changes in intrinsic tissue mechanical parameters and external friction with a continuous 2D viscoelastic description</title>
<p>The analysis of observed bead responses with an effective rheological scheme allows for the detection of rapid changes in the mechanical environment the bead is embedded in. However, effective response parameters are not direct read-Bouts of actual material properties of the tissue, and cannot relate the spatial deformation of the tissue to the applied force. To overcome this limitation, we analyzed two complementary measurements of the tissue response in pulling experiments (bead displacement and tissue deformation) in the framework of a continuum description of tissue mechanics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In our description, we represent the tissue as a two-dimensional flat sheet with tension tensor <italic>t<sub>ij</sub></italic>, moving with friction relative to a substrate and subjected to a 2D effective external force density from the bead <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>, such that force balance on the tissue reads

Sliding of the tissue is resisted by friction. Bead-induced tissue deformation (represented by arrows) is decomposed in x- and y-deformation (shown as heatmaps).

The tissue is described here as a linear Maxwell-Kelvin-Voigt material: the tissue is assumed to have a viscous response characterized by <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> and on short time scales <italic>t</italic> &#x003C; <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> /<italic>E</italic>, an elastic response on intermediate time scales <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="167155_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and that elastic stresses are relaxed above the Maxwell viscoelastic time scale <italic>&#x03C4;</italic>. In line with our choice of a continuous linear description, we note that for forces ranging from 50pN to 115pN, bead displacement and epithelial deformations scale approximately linearly with the force amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Note that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> is, however, a description of the tissue rheology which is not equivalent to the effective description of the bead behaviour introduced above, as it distinguishes explicitly between dissipative processes internal to the tissue (characterized by viscosities) and external to the tissue (characterized by a friction coefficient). In addition, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. (2)</xref> discriminates between isotropic and anisotropic elastic moduli and viscosities.</p>
<p>We then solved <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">2</xref> and used a fitting procedure to adjust the theoretically predicted bead displacement as a function of time and the displacement field at the end of force application to experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Suppl. Info. and Material and methods). We found that both the bead displacement and tissue deformation field could be reproduced with the continuum description in the early and late phases of cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Video 4 and Video 5).</p>
<p>We then compared the values of mechanical parameters extracted at different stages. We found changes in elasticity from <italic>E</italic> &#x2243; 29 pN/&#x03BC;m to 7 pN/&#x03BC;m, shear viscosity from <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> &#x2243; 540 pN. s/&#x03BC;m to 105 pN. s/&#x03BC;m, and Maxwell viscoelastic timescale from &#x03C4; &#x2243; 530s to 300s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These changes correspond to an overall softening of the epithelium, while the characteristic timescale of viscous to elastic transition (&#x007E;10s) and long-time plasticity (&#x007E;100s) does not vary significantly. Interestingly, these values match relaxation timescales measured during the Zebra fish tail bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Serwane et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we found that the friction coefficient was increasing from &#x007E;0.8 pN.s/&#x03BC;m<sup>3</sup> to 2.2 pN.s/&#x03BC;m<sup>3</sup>. We wondered why the friction coefficient was changing over the course of cellularization, given that it reflects resistance to motion between the tissue and surrounding structures. We therefore analyzed the width of the perivitelline space as a function of time, and found that the apical surface of the cells is getting in closer contact with the vitellin envelope at late cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). This observation suggests that as the embryo approaches the vitellin envelope, increased mechanical interactions lead to an increase in the external friction coefficient.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the long time-scale hydrodynamic length <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="167155_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> characterizes the spatial range of mechanical interactions in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bonnet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). We find that this length decreases from &#x007E;140 &#x03BC;m to &#x007E;30 &#x03BC;m over the course of cellularization.</p>
<p>Altogether, our method allowed us to identify a significant tissue softening and an increase in external friction occurring during cellularization. Both are contributing to the strong reduction in the spatial propagation of deformation generated by otherwise similar force fields.</p>

<title>Actomyosin and microtubule cytoskeletons impact the mechanical properties of the blastoderm</title>
<p>To relate the observed changes in mechanical properties of the epithelium during this softening to intracellular components, we performed our mechanical probing experiments in embryos injected with pharmacological drugs affecting cytoskeletal components. We used a Rho kinase inhibitor (Rho-K), Y27632 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Uehata et al., 1997</xref>), and a microtubule depolymerizing drug, Colcemid, to affect actomyosin contractility and the microtubule cytoskeleton, respectively. It has been reported that both components of the cytoskeleton contribute to the developmental remodeling occurring during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Royou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Xue and Sokac, 2016</xref>). Pharmacological drugs were injected after magnetic particle injection and before performing pulling experiments. The output of the experiments was then analyzed with both the spring-dashpot model and our 2D continuous viscoelastic model.</p>
<p>Rho-K inhibited embryos did not show major changes in the effective parameters <italic>K, &#x03BC;</italic><sub>1</sub>, and <italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sub>2</sub> compared to WT in both the early and late phases of cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">1D</xref>, Video 6 and Video 7). A fit to our 2D description indicated that epithelial elasticity is not affected by Rho-K treatment in both phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). However, we observed a major change in bulk viscosity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="167155_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of &#x007E;180&#x0025; at early cellularization, in the friction coefficient <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> compare to WT (a 310&#x0025; increase at early cellularization and a 34&#x0025; decrease in late cellularization), and a decrease in the viscoelastic relaxation timescale <italic>&#x03C4;</italic> (a 66&#x0025; decrease at early cellularization and a 43&#x0025; decrease at late cellularization). This is reflected in changes in the spatial propagation of the deformation and of the hydrodynamic length scale by a factor &#x007E;3 compared to WT early cellularization (Supp. Info. Table II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1-B</xref>). To identify whether the changes in friction observed in Rho-K injected embryos arise from the interaction with the vitellin envelope, we estimated the width of perivitellin space. We found that the distance between the apical cell surface and the vitelline membrane is smaller in Rho-K treated embryos at early cellularization, i.e. when we measure a higher external friction and, conversely, increased in late cellularization when we measure a decrease in external friction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of microtubules, apico-basal progression of membranes is impaired and embryos fail to cellularize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Royou et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore used Colcemid treatment to measure the effect of microtubule depolymerization on epithelial mechanics during cellularization. We observed that the transition in mechanical parameters observed in WT was absent in Colcemid-treated embryos, indicating that the shift in mechanical parameters is associated with the process of cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, Colcemid treatment also affected the response of the epithelium to mechanical forces in the early phases of cellularization. With our spring-dashpot analysis, we identified that the major effect of Colcemid treatment was an increase in the fluidity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="167155_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> by a factor &#x007E;2 compared to WT in the early phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">D</xref>). Interestingly, these modulations are also associated with changes in the deformation field. The spatial range of experimentally observed deformation is smaller than in WT at early cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>, Video 2 and Video 8). As for WT, we could recapitulate the deformation field and bead displacements measured in Colcemid injected embryos with our 2D theoretical description of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Compared to WT in early cellularization, our fitting procedure indicated a 5-fold increase in the friction <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>, a 2-fold decrease of the shear viscosity <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> and a 5-fold decrease in the long-time viscoelastic timescale <italic>&#x03C4;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). This decrease in the Maxwell viscoelastic timescale in the continuum model indicates that long time-scale relaxation of elastic forces is considerably accelerated in Colcemid-treated embryos. This observation suggests that relaxation of stresses stored in the microtubule network is responsible for the slow dynamics of tissue deformation in the WT embryo. Using these values, we find that the hydrodynamic length is about 25 &#x03BC;m, i.e. &#x007E;5 times shorter than WT in early cellularization, thus accounting for the decrease in the spatial extent of deformation observed in Colcemid-treated embryos. The observed changes in frictional forces are, here as well, consistent with a reduction in the space between the vitellin envelope and the blastoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Altogether, we observe an inverse correlation between friction coefficients and perivitellin space widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A-B</xref>), suggesting that cytoskeletal components may affect the distance between the tissue and the vitellin membrane, and consequently external friction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we presented a methodology to apply controlled forces, extract tissue-scale deformations and measure mechanical properties of epithelia within a generic continuum mechanics framework. Our method allows for the <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement of essential physical parameters governing tissue-scale deformations and flows and therefore to relate force patterns to spatial deformation profiles. We can monitor mechanical changes during development, and could uncover a rapid step-like softening of the blastoderm preceding the onset of gastrulation. Our work therefore indicates that, in addition of the modulation of cellular forces, mechanical properties of tissues can change significantly on time-scales of the order of minutes during morphogenesis. Such changes must impact morphogenetic processes, as the pattern and amplitude of deformations in response to the same force field is set by the mechanical properties of the involved tissues. In particular, we can speculate about an essential role for the observed softening during cellularization in the consequent rearrangements associated with gastrulation. Indeed, low tissue stiffness and high external friction reduce the range of propagation of deformations, and therefore allows for local deformation without impacting cells at larger distances. This feature could be important when several morphogenetic rearrangements occur concurrently, such as during gastrulation. In addition, our results obtained in drug-injected embryos identified the microtubule network as one of the main factors in determining tissue mechanics at this stage. Our work therefore suggests that the observed modulation of tissue mechanics is due to the rearrangement of the microtubule network occurring during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Foe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Mazumdar and Mazumdar, 2002</xref>). Microtubules emanating from the asters associated to different nuclei display transient connections that disappear during cellularization. A highly connected microtubule meshwork before celularization thus rearranges into a network of only weakly interacting microtubules asters. One hypothesis could be that this change in connectivity is at the origin of the observed changes in mechanics.</p>
<p>Finally, our method for mechanical measurements, due to its versatility, low cost and adaptability to different microscopy techniques can easily be employed in other systems. It thus paves the way for further studies mapping out epithelial mechanics. Therefore, it will serve as an important tool for understanding the emergence of mechanical properties at the tissue-scale in developmental contexts and in cases of disease.</p>

<title>Preparation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Embryos</title>
<p>To inject the bead at pre-blastoderm stage, the embryos are collected during 15min, dechorionated in 100&#x0025; bleach and mounted on an heptane/glue coverslip(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fish et al., 2007</xref>). The tissue in which the bead will be located has to face the coverslip. Once mounted, the embryos are dehydrated during 10 min at 25&#x00B0;C and then covered with voltalef 10S oil.</p>

<title>Particle microinjection</title>
<p>MicroBneedles are generated by pulling 1mm glass capillaries (Narishige G1) using a micro-puller (Sutter instruments P30). The needle tip is then opened and beveled in a controlled manner to facilitate the injection using a micro grinder (Narishige EG-44). The internal diameter is set to be slightly smaller than the particle, i.e., 3.5-4 <italic>&#x03BC;m</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1-A</xref>). This allows, by tuning the pressure inside the micro-needle with a microinjector (WPI PV 820), to hold and inject an individual particle within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Once inside the embryo, the bead can be oriented on the A-P and dorso-lateral axes using an electromagnet. After injection, the embryos are positioned above a permanent magnet and are let aged (2h to apply force during cellularization) in a wet chamber at 25&#x00B0;C.</p>

<title>Calibration of the electro-magnet</title>
<p>To induce controlled forces we designed an electromagnet similarly to previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kollmannsberger and Fabry, 2007</xref>). A core of soft metal with a tip shape (Mumetal, Sekels Gmbh) is surrounded by 100 coils of copper cable alimented by a power supply in order to generate a solenoid. An additional radiator is placed in between the soft metal core and the cupper coils to evacuate the thermal dissipation. The electric current circulating within the cupper coils will generate a magnetic field that will be focused at the tip of the soft metal core. The magnetic force exerted on the paramagnetic micro-particle is directly proportional to the gradient of magnetic field(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kollmannsberger and Fabry, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the force would be the highest close to the tip and decay as a power law with the distance to the tip of the electro-magnet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1-B</xref>). In order to calibrate the magnetic force exerted on the micro-particle, we have established a calibration assay with micro-particle embedded in PDMS (Sigma Aldrich). Because its viscosity is well established, by measuring the velocity of the micro-particles within the magnetic field generated by the electro-magnet, one can determine precisely the force applied to the particle as a function of its distance to the tip for a specific current applied in the solenoid. For a current of 0.3A, the typical force-distance curve range from &#x007E;1nN at 60 &#x03BC;m from the tip to &#x007E;100 pN at 200 &#x03BC;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Due to geometrical constrains arising from the embryo shape, the typically used bead-magnet distances in our experiments were about 190&#x03BC;m (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). This corresponds to forces of &#x007E;115pN (high force condition, for 0.3A) and &#x007E;50pN (low force condition, for 0.15A). Note that for currents above 0.5A the magnetic force saturates.</p>

<title>Imaging and force application</title>
<p>Embryos were imaged at room temperature (22&#x00B0;C) using an Andor spinning disk confocal microscope. Z stacks of 4-5 sections spaced by 1 micron interval were collected every 5 seconds with 100X magnification.</p>
<p>The magnet was precisely positioned with a three-axis micromanipulator (Narishige UMM-3FC) mounted on the microscope stage. In the experiments, the electromagnet has been positioned approximately at 190 &#x03BC;m from the bead, and the force has been applied systematically for 65s. Data considered valid for analysis are cases when the bead is attached to the apical cell membrane. Occasionally, the bead detaches from the membrane, displaces in the basal direction or is attached to a wrong site in the cell for pulling experiment. In those cases, we did not include the data in the analysis.</p>

<title>Analysis of the bead displacement</title>
<p>Analysis of the bead displacement was performed using Fiji. Tracking of the bead was performed on images acquired on the red channel where the auto-fluorescence of the particle is emitted. The following analysis step were implemented: (1) A median filter (radius 2) is applied on maximum intensity projections of each z stacks, (2) the projection is then manually thresholded, (3) MTrack2 plugin was used to automatically extract the x-y coordinate of the bead. In some occasions, samples showed drift. In order to detrend extracted bead displacements, we fit a linear function, <italic>f</italic> (<italic>x</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>mx</italic> &#x002B; <italic>c</italic>, to the bead displacement in the 100s preceding the force application. Assuming this drift pertained during the force application, we subtracted this linear trend from the bead displacement.</p>

<title>Analysis of the experimental deformation field</title>
<p>Experimental images where aligned using the position of the bead at t&#x003D;0s. Cell shapes were determined from the outlines of cell membranes at the onset and at the end of the period of force application, i.e. at t&#x003D;0s and t&#x003D;65s, respectively, using the software Packing Analyzer v.2.0(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). Cells where tracked using the same software. We determined the displacement vector, d(x), corresponding to the centroid movement between t&#x003D;0s and t&#x003D;65s of all cells within the field of view. Here, x=(x,y) is a vector denoting the position of the centroid of the cell at t&#x003D;0s relative to the bead at t&#x003D;0s. We considered the total set of obtained deformation vectors, {<italic>d</italic>(<italic>x<sub>k</sub></italic>) <italic>for k</italic>&#x003D;1, &#x2026;, <italic>M</italic>}, as the readout of the experimental deformation field.

<title>Vitelline envelope-apical cell surface distance estimation analysis</title>
<p>The estimation of the distance between the vitellin envelope and apical cell surface was performed using z-reslice along the AP axis (using FIJI) of z-stacks spaced by 0.5 &#x03BC;m of embryo expressing Resille-GFP injected with Dextran Texas-Red 70000MW(Molecular Probes) in the perivitelline space. We use the fluorescence intensity of Dextran Texas Red as a proxy for the position of the perivitelline space. With a homemade Matlab script, an average z-fluorescence profile is obtained by: 1) performing a sliding average of 5 pixels along the z-reslice and 2) by realigning in z each local average to the maximal dextran-RFP fluorescence intensity. A spline interpolation has been performed on the Resille-GFP intensity curves to determine the position of the maximum of intensity.</p>

On the left, the parameters are estimated for WT embryo (Resille-GFP) at low force steps of &#x007E;50pN and high force steps of &#x007E;115pN. The estimated three parameters are approximately the same for 50pN and 115pN forces indicating that the tissue behaves linearly in this force regime. On the right, parameters are estimated for the same force amplitude (&#x007E;115pN) for Resille-GFP expressing embryos and Resille-GFP embryos injected with Rho-K, Colcemid and DMSO. Numbers on the error bars are the number of force application. &#x002A;&#x002A; indicate p values smaller then 0.05 calculated using two sided t-test. Error bars represent standard deviations.</p>

For Rho-K injected embryos, we still observe a step-like behavior in the evolution of the three parameters. The red line is a sigmoidal fit recapitulating the time evolution of the parameters. For embryos treated with Colcemid there are no significant changes between early and late cellularization. In both cases the black dashed line represents the separation between early (in orange) and late (in blue) force applications. The insets show the mean value for each parameter for early and late cellularization. Error bars represent standard deviations.</p></caption>
