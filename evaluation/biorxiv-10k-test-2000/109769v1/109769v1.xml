<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The PML (promyelocytic leukemia) protein is a member of the TRIM family, a large group of proteins that show high diversity in functions but possess a common tripartite motif giving the family its name. We and others recently reported that both murine and human PML strongly restrict the early stages of infection by HIV-1 and other lentiviruses when expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This restriction activity was found to contribute to the type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 in MEFs. Additionally, PML caused transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 promoter in MEFs. By contrast, the modulation of the early stages of HIV-1 infection of human cells by PML has been investigated by RNAi with unclear results. In order to conclusively determine whether PML restricts HIV-1 or not in human cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out its gene in epithelial, lymphoid and monocytic human cell lines. Infection challenges showed that PML knockout had no effect on the permissiveness of these cells to HIV-1 infection. IFN-I treatments inhibited HIV-1 equally whether PML was expressed or not. Over-expression of individual hPML isoforms, or of mPML, in a human T cell line did not restrict HIV-1. The presence of PML was not required for the restriction of nonhuman retroviruses by TRIM5&#x03B1;, another human TRIM protein, and TRIM5&#x03B1; was inhibited by arsenic trioxide through a PML-independent mechanism. We conclude that PML is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 in human cell lines representing diverse lineages.</p>

<title>Importance (150 words)</title>
<p>PML is involved in innate immune mechanisms against both DNA and RNA viruses. Although the mechanism by which PML inhibits highly divergent viruses is unclear, it was recently found that it can increase the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, whether human PML inhibits HIV-1 has been debated. Here we provide unambiguous, knockout-based evidence that PML does not restrict the early post-entry stages of HIV-1 infection in a variety of human cell types and does not participate in the inhibition of HIV-1 by IFN-I. Although this study does not exclude the possibility of other mechanisms by which PML may interfere with HIV-1, we nonetheless demonstrate that PML does not generally act as an HIV-1 restriction factor in human cells and that its presence is not required for IFN-I to stimulate the expression of anti-HIV-1 genes. These results contribute to uncovering the landscape of HIV-1 inhibition by ISGs in human cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>PML/TRIM19 belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein superfamily that shares a conserved tripartite architecture: a RING domain, one or two B-boxes, and a coiled-coil domain (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Due to the alternative splicing of the C-terminal domain, seven PML isoforms are present in human cells. Isoforms I to VI are primarily located in the nucleus, while PML VII is mostly cytoplasmic (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PML is the major component of a nuclear substructure named PML nuclear body (PML NB). PML NBs are dynamic and their size, number, and composition change in response to cellular stresses or during the cell cycle. In addition to PML, these NBs recruit many other proteins in a transient fashion (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). TRIM5&#x03B1;, a cytoplasmic factor that restricts retroviruses in a species-specific, virus-specific manner (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), is actively shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and localizes to the PML NBs when present in the nucleus (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). PML is involved in many cellular activities including transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
<p>IFNs are a multigene family of inducible cytokines released by host cells in response to pathogens, including viruses (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). IFN-I binding to its receptor leads to the transcriptional stimulation of a set of genes encoding antiviral proteins which inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The transcription of PML and of many NB-associated proteins (e.g. Daxx and Sp100) is up-regulated by IFN-I (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Conversely, it was recently proposed that PML is involved in the IFN-I-induced expression of ISGs by directly binding their promoter (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
<p>The involvement of PML in antiviral defense mechanisms against several DNA and RNA viruses has been extensively studied. PML was shown to restrict a complex retrovirus, the human foamy virus, by inhibiting viral gene expression (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). PML deficient cells are also more prone to infection with rabies virus (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, PML was shown to interfere with the replication of poliovirus (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), adeno-associated virus (AAV) (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), influenza virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). As a direct consequence, some viruses such as HSV-1 and the human cytomegalovirus have evolved mechanisms to counteract PML, either by disrupting PML NBs and/or by inducing PML degradation (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of PML in HIV-1 infection of human cells is controversial. As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a drug that induces PML oligomerization and degradation (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), was shown to increase the susceptibility of human cells to N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) and HIV-1 (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A recent study proposed that PML was an indirect inhibitor of HIV-1 early post-entry infection stages through its association with Daxx, a constitutive partner protein in PML NBs (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, another group found that the depletion of PML (but not that of Daxx) enhanced HIV-1 infection in human primary fibroblasts, while having no effect in T cell lines such as Jurkat (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). PML was also found to regulate HIV-1 latency. Specifically, PML degradation or NBs disruption resulted in the activation of HIV-1 provirus transcription in a lymphoid model of HIV-1 latency (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), although these results have not been independently confirmed. There is consensus, however, on the existence of a PML-dependent restriction of HIV-1 in MEFs. In these cells, PML inhibits the early post-entry stages of infection (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and also promotes the transcriptional silencing of the integrated provirus (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Human PML (hPML) was able to reconstitute both restriction activities in MEFs knocked out for the endogenous murine PML (mPML), in an isoform-specific fashion (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In addition, the inhibition of lentiviruses by IFN-I in MEFs involves PML (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In this study, we investigate the role of PML in the restriction of HIV-1 and other retroviruses in several human cell lines, including T cells and myeloid cells, by gene knockout. We also examine the role of PML in the IFN-induced restriction of lentiviruses in human cells. We show that PML is dispensable for the restriction of lentiviruses in human cells, is not involved in the IFN-I-mediated inhibition of infection, and is not relevant to the inhibition of TRIM5&#x03B1; by As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<title>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of PML in human cells</title>
<p>In order to stably and irreversibly deplete PML in human cells, we designed two guide RNAs (gRNAs), hPML1 and hPML2, to target the Cas9 nuclease towards exon 2 of <italic>PML</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The plasmid used in this study, pLentiCRISPRv2 (pLCv2), can mediate knockouts through transfection and also through lentiviral transduction. The control plasmid, pLCv2-CAG, targets the CMV-IE/chicken actin/rabbit beta globin hybrid promoter, a nonhuman sequence (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We used the Surveyor assay (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) to reveal the presence of insertions/deletions (indels) in the PML gene of HEK293T cells transiently transfected with pLCv2-hPML1 or pLCv2-hPML2. We could observe the presence of PML DNA digestion products of the expected size in cells transfected with each of the PML gRNAs but not in cells transfected with the control gRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating that both PML gRNAs generated double-strand breaks that were repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).</p>

<title>Knocking out PML in human monocytic cells has little to no effect on the permissiveness to HIV-1 in the presence or absence of IFN-I</title>
<p>Human monocytic THP-1 cells were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors produced using pLCv2-hPML1 and pLCv2-hPML2. Following puromycin selection to eliminate non-transduced cells, we performed a Western blotting (WB) analysis of PML levels in bulk populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The levels of hPML were not sufficiently high to be detected in unstimulated cells (not shown), and therefore, the analysis was done using cells treated with IFN-&#x03B2;. In control cells we found several bands corresponding to hPML isoforms, as previously reported (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the cells transduced with the hPML gRNAs, PML was undetectable, showing that knockout was efficient with both gRNAs. This result is consistent with the NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis observed in transfected HEK293T cells using both gRNAs shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. As both gRNAs showed similar efficiency, all the subsequent experiments in this study were only performed with one gRNA, hPML1. We next infected PML knockout (hPML1 gRNA transduced) and control cells (CAG transduced) with a single dose of HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), a VSV-G-pseudotyped, &#x0394;-Envelope HIV-1 vector expressing GFP in place of Nef (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The percentage of GFP-positive cells following HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> challenge is directly proportional to the cells&#x2019; permissiveness toward infection by this virus. This system is thus well-suited to analyze restriction activities taking place during post-entry steps and until integration. These infections were performed in the presence or absence of IFN-&#x03B2;, owing to the reported role of PML in stimulating the transcription of ISGs (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In the absence of IFN-&#x03B2;, we found that the PML-KO cells were slightly more permissive to infection by HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> compared with the control cells (less than 2-fold). The addition of IFN-&#x03B2; very strongly inhibited (&#x003E;20-fold) the infection of THP-1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and the low numbers of infected cells prevented a fine analysis of the role of PML in this inhibition. However, the absence of PML clearly did not prevent IFN-&#x03B2; from inhibiting HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub>, showing that PML was dispensable for this activity.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a more complete picture of the importance of PML in the permissiveness to retroviruses in this immune cell line, we performed additional infections with this HIV-1 vector as well as with GFP-expressing vectors derived from the macaque strain of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub>), the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV<sub>GFP</sub>) and the B-tropic murine leukemia virus (B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub>). EIAV is restricted by TRIM5&#x03B1; in human cells (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), making it possible to analyze whether PML modulates the restriction of retroviruses by this well-characterized restriction factor. Infectivity of the three lentiviral vectors (HIV-1, SIVmac, EIAV) was slightly higher in the absence of PML at most virus doses used, whereas infectivity of the B-MLV vector was unaffected by PML knockout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results suggest that PML has a small, barely detectable inhibitory effect on the infection of THP-1 cells by lentiviruses and does not modulate TRIM5&#x03B1; activity. Treatment with IFN-&#x03B2; strongly decreased THP-1 permissiveness to all four vectors, preventing us from measuring the -fold decrease in infectivity with accuracy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, it was clear that IFN-&#x03B2; efficiently inhibited infection in the presence or absence of PML, indicating that PML is not crucial for the IFN-I-mediated anti-retroviral response.</p>

<title>Knocking out PML in human epithelial cells has little to no effect on the permissiveness to retroviral infections in the presence or absence of IFN-I</title>
<p>We then transduced epithelial carcinoma HeLa cells with the the CAG or PML gRNAs. PML was efficiently knocked out, as seen by WB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We also performed immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze the effect of PML knockout on PML and SUMO nuclear bodies. A large part (but not all) of SUMO-1 localizes to PML bodies in normal conditions (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). As expected, signal corresponding to PML nuclear bodies almost completely disappeared from the cells transduced with the PML gRNA (Fig. S1). In addition, SUMO-1 punctate nuclear staining was strongly diminished but not abolished (Fig. S1). We then challenged the stably transduced cells with GFP-expressing viral vectors like we had done in THP-1 cells. We found that susceptibility to HIV-1, SIVmac, EIAV and B-MLV vectors was identical whether PML was present or not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). IFN-&#x03B2; inhibited all four viral vectors, although the magnitude of this effect (&#x007E;2- to 3-fold) was much smaller than in THP-1 cells. IFN-&#x03B2; treatments had identical effects in PML-expressing and PML-knockout cells, again showing that PML does not modulate this inhibitory pathway in human cells.</p>

<title>A knock-in approach to suppress PML in human cells</title>
<p>In order to achieve efficient knockout by transient transfection without the need to isolate cellular clones by limiting dilution, we constructed a plasmid to serve as donor DNA in homology-directed repair (HDR). This plasmid contains two &#x007E;800bp-long PML homology arms surrounding a neomycin resistance cassette (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). It is expected that its co-transfection in cells along with Cas9 and the hPML gRNA1 would lead to the knock-in of Neo<sup>R</sup> in <italic>PML</italic> through HDR in a fraction of the cells. Selection in neomycin then eliminates cells in which the knock-in did not occur. Even if not all alleles of a given gene are successfully modified by knock-in, recent reports indicate that the remaining ones are usually knocked out through NHEJ-dependent mechanisms (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). We designed PCR primers for the specific amplification of the knock-in product and another pair to amplify the wild-type (WT) or the NHEJ-repair knockout alleles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To validate this system, we co-transfected TE671 cells with pLCv2. PML1 and the HDR donor plasmid, and randomly isolated a number of neomycin-resistant cell clones of which a representative analysis is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>. The knock-in product was detected as expected in all 7 clones while being absent in the parental cells. On the other hand, the band corresponding to WT or NHEJ-repaired alleles was less intense in these clones relative to the parental cells, but was always present, suggesting that HDR-mediated knockout did not affect all the <italic>PML</italic> alleles.</p>

<caption><p>HDR-mediated knockout of PML. (A) Schematic of the HDR plasmid and targeting strategy for the knock-in of the Neomycin resistance gene at the PML locus. Two 800 bp-long PML homology arms encompass the Neo<sup>R</sup> expression cassette on plasmid pNMs-Neo.HDR-hPML. The arms are complementary to the PML regions on either side of the gRNA1-mediated Cas9 cleavage site.

<title>PML is important for the efficient inhibition of SIVmac but not HIV-1 by IFN-I in lymphoid cells</title>
<p>We knocked out PML in Jurkat cells using the transfection approach that results in the insertion of <italic>Neo</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup> in <italic>PML</italic>, as described above. We performed WB analyses to assess knockout efficiency. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Treatment with the IFN-I species IFN-&#x03B1;, IFN-&#x03B2; and IFN-&#x03C9; stimulated PML expression in Jurkat cells. PML was efficiently knocked out (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), validating the HDR-based approach. In the absence of IFN-&#x03B2;, PML had little effect on the infectivity of all four vectors (&#x02C2;2-fold) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The effect of IFN-&#x03B2; treatment differed according to the retroviral vector used (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). IFN-&#x03B2; treatment decreased HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> infectivity by &#x007E;3.5-fold in both control and PML-KO cells. IFN-&#x03B2; similarly decreased the infectivity of SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub> by about 4-fold, but only in the control cells. In the PML-KO cells, the inhibitory effect of IFN-&#x03B2; on SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub> infectivity was smaller (&#x02C2;2-fold). Interestingly, we found the opposite situation upon challenge with the EIAV<sub>GFP</sub> vector: IFN-&#x03B2; treatment had no effect on EIAV<sub>GFP</sub> infectivity in the WT Jurkat cells, whereas it significantly inhibited this vector in PML-KO cells, especially at low vector doses. Finally, IFN-&#x03B2; decreased the infectivity of B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> in both WT cells and PML-KO cells, with no apparent specificity. Thus, Jurkat cells provided a more complex situation with respect to the importance of PML in the antiviral effects of IFN-&#x03B2;. In order to further study the contrasting phenotypes of the HIV-1 and SIVmac vectors in these cells, we also analyzed the effects of IFN-&#x03B1; and IFN-&#x03C9;. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). We found that in control cells, all three IFN-I species decreased infectivity of both the HIV-1 and the SIVmac vectors, by 2- to 4-fold; IFN-&#x03B2; appearing to be the most consistently inhibitory IFN-I in these cells, similar to what we had observed in other cell lines (not shown) and to what was reported in the literature (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In PML-KO cells, HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> was inhibited by all three IFN-I species, similar to the control cells. In contrast, IFN-I inhibition of SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub> was much less efficient in PML-KO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, bottom right panel). Thus, PML is important for IFN-I to inhibit the early infection stages of SIVmac, but not HIV-1, in Jurkat cells.</p>

<title>Over-expression of murine or human PML in Jurkat cells does not affect the infectivity of an HIV-1 vector</title>
<p>Unlike the PML-KO THP-1, HeLa and TE671 cells, the PML-KO Jurkat cells generated do not continuously express Cas9 or a PML-targeting gRNA. Thus, these cells provided an appropriate model to test whether the over-expression of specific hPML isoforms in a PML-KO background could inhibit HIV-1 or other retroviruses. In other words, this experiment was designed to reveal a possible cryptic restriction activity associated with specific PML isoforms that would normally not be apparent due to the presence of other isoforms. We retrovirally transduced the isoforms I to VI of hPML into PML-KO Jurkat cells, separately. Because HIV-1 is inhibited by mPML in MEFs (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we also transduced mPML. A WB analysis showed that all six isoforms of hPML were expressed, as was mPML isoform 2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). We then challenged the various cell cultures with the HIV-1, SIVmac, EIAV and B-MLV vectors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). We found that none of the PML isoforms had an effect on GFP transduction by HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub>. Interestingly, several hPML isoforms and mPML slightly increased permissiveness to SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub>, by &#x007E;2-fold. Permissiveness to EIAV<sub>GFP</sub> was significantly decreased by over-expression of hPML-IV, hPML-VI and mPML. Finally, the presence of hPML-VI also slightly inhibited infection by B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> at least at some virus doses used (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Thus, although individual PML isoforms modulated the permissiveness to infection by the SIVmac, EIAV and B-MLV vectors in a virus-specific fashion, none of them affected permissiveness to infection by the HIV-1 vector.</p>

<title>Restriction of N-MLV by TRIM5&#x03B1; and inhibition of TRIM5&#x03B1; by arsenic trioxide are independent of PML</title>
<p>Intriguingly, TRIM5&#x03B1; localizes at PML bodies when shuttling to the nucleus, as demonstrated by pharmacological treatment interfering with its nuclear export (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The possibility of PML involvement in the inhibition of retroviruses by TRIM5&#x03B1; has been envisioned but not proven. The infectivity of the EIAV vector used here (which is restricted 5- to 10-fold by human TRIM5&#x03B1; (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)) was not significantly affected by knocking out PML (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggesting that TRIM5&#x03B1; does not require PML. In order to increase sensitivity, we used an &#x201C;N-tropic&#x201D; strain of MLV, which is even more strongly restricted by human TRIM5&#x03B1; (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) than EIAV, and of which restriction is counteracted by As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in a cell context-specific fashion (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Thus, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> greatly increases the infectivity of N-MLV but not B-MLV vectors in many human cell lines. The mechanism of action of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> against TRIM5&#x03B1; has not been determined but it was thought to involve PML, since As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is well-known as a specific inhibitor of PML (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Interestingly, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> also enhances the infectivity of HIV-1 in human cells, although the magnitude of this effect is milder than what is found with N-MLV (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We infected HeLa, TE671 and Jurkat cells with HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub>, B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> and N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> in the presence of increasing As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). In the absence of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> infectivity was barely detectable or undetectable in all three cell lines, reflecting the strong inhibition conferred by TRIM5&#x03B1; in human cells. At the same virus dose, B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> infected 3&#x0025; to 5&#x0025; of the cells. PML knockout had no effect on the infectivity of the two MLV vectors, implying that PML is not required for TRIM5&#x03B1;-mediated restriction of N-MLV. In presence of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> infectivity was greatly enhanced, although the stimulating effect was partly reversed at high As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in HeLa and TE671 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> effectiveness at counteracting TRIM5&#x03B1;-mediated restrictions was found to decrease at high concentrations in previous studies as well (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In contrast to N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub>, B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> was only slightly enhanced by As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. As reported before, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> modestly increased HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> infection of HeLa and TE671 cells, although it had no effect on this vector in Jurkat cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Knocking out PML had no detectable effect on the As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-mediated stimulation of N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> and HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> in the three cell lines tested. We performed an additional infection of the HeLa cells with the N-MLV and B-MLV vectors, this time at a fixed As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> concentration and varying virus doses. Again, we observed that (i) PML had no effect on the infectivity of N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> and B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub>, (ii) As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-mediated stimulation of N-MLV<sub>GFP</sub> was significantly stronger than that of B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub>, regardless of the virus dose, and (iii) knocking out PML had no impact on the effect of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the MLV vectors. These data demonstrate that PML is not involved in the restriction of N-MLV by TRIM5&#x03B1;, nor is it involved in the mechanism by which As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> stimulates retroviral infections and counteracts TRIM5&#x03B1;.</p>

<title>PML is not required for TRIM5&#x03B1;-mediated restriction of HIV-1 in MEFs</title>
<p>MEFs provide a cellular environment in which PML restricts HIV-1, as seen by several laboratories (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In addition, PML also inhibits HIV-1 transcription in MEFs, an effect that we did not observe in human cells (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we used PML-KO MEFs (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). WT and PML-KO MEFs were stably transduced with the HIV-1-restrictive Rhesus macaque TRIM5&#x03B1; or the non-restrictive human TRIM5&#x03B1; as a control. The cells were also transduced with the C35A RING domain mutant of each TRIM5&#x03B1; ortholog, which abolishes the RING domain-associated ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Colocalization of a fraction of TRIM5&#x03B1; with PML NBs was seen in the presence of the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, consistent with published data obtained in human and canine cells (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and exposure of the cells to HIV-1 did not modify this pattern (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). The cells were then challenged with HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub> or with the relatively restriction insensitive SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub> as a control (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). HIV-1 was very strongly restricted by rhTRIM5&#x03B1; in both WT and PML-KO MEF cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). As expected, C35A rhTRIM5&#x03B1; and hTRIM5&#x03B1; (WT or C35A) had little to no effect on HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub>. SIV<sub>mac-GFP</sub> was moderately restricted by rhTRIM5&#x03B1;, and PML knockout did not affect this inhibitory effect (in fact, restriction was slightly greater in the absence of PML) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Whether PML has an impact or not on the infection of human cells by HIV-1 has been an open question for over 15 years. Trono and colleagues reported that PML is transiently exported in the cytoplasm following exposure to HIV-1 and co-localizes with the incoming virus in HeLa cells (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>); however, this study did not include functional evidence for the involvement of PML in HIV-1 infection. Another team found no effect of HIV-1 infection on the distribution of PML bodies (<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a known PML inhibitor, was found to enhance the infection of human cells with HIV-1 (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) but it also stimulated the infection of MEFs with HIV-1 vectors whether PML was present or not (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Interest for PML as a modulator of HIV-1 infection surfaced again in recent years, as it was proposed to act as an HIV-1 restriction factor in mouse and human cells (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the data gathered so far by three different teams, including this study, suggest that the restriction activity in human cells, if it exists, is cell type-specific. Dutrieux and colleagues, using shRNAs, observed a modest inhibition of HIV-1 vector transduction conferred by PML in HeLa cells (&#x003C;2-fold). They also observed a small delay in HIV-1 propagation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but the decrease in infectivity was not quantified (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We previously observed that knocking down PML in T-lymphoid Sup-T1 cells increases HIV-1 infectivity by 2&#x002D; to 4-fold (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). On the other hand, Kahle and colleagues saw no effect of knocking down PML on the infectivity of an HIV-1 vector in T lymphoid cell lines including CEM, HuT78, Jurkat and Molt4 (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). They showed, however, that PML reduces HIV-1 infectivity in human foreskin fibroblasts by 2&#x002D; to 3-fold (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Taken together, those previous papers showed that knocking down PML has either no effect or modest effects on HIV-1 infectivity in human cells. We were not able to efficiently knock out PML in Sup-T1 cells, preventing us from drawing comparisons with our previous knockdown results. However, our knockout experiments in Jurkat, THP-1, HeLa and TE671 are not consistent with PML being an HIV-1 restriction factor in human cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the EIAV and B-MLV vectors were slightly inhibited by PML in Jurkat cells, as judged by infectivity in PML knockout cells. Furthermore, over-expression of hPML-IV in the PML-KO Jurkat cells had an inhibitory effect on EIAV<sub>GFP</sub> and to a lesser extent on B-MLV<sub>GFP</sub>. Thus, it is possible that this hPML isoform contributes to the inhibition of specific retroviruses in this cell line. However, the effects seen are probably too small for us to characterize a mechanism or identify determinants of the restriction.</p>
<p>A recent study by Kim and Ahn (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) uncovered an additional function for PML in human skin fibroblasts: the stimulation of ISG expression through a direct association with their promoter. Accordingly, we previously showed that PML was important for the efficient inhibition of HIV-1 by IFN-I in MEF cells (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Although HIV-1 is also readily inhibited by IFN-I in a variety of human cell types, as illustrated in our study, we find that this effect is not affected by knocking out PML. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that PML is involved in regulating IFN-I-dependent transcription in specific cellular contexts such as skin fibroblasts (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It is also possible that PML stimulates the transcription of some ISGs but not others. In support of this idea is our observation that SIVmac inhibition by IFN-I in Jurkat cells was significantly greater in the presence of PML. SIVmac, but not HIV-1, is inhibited by an unidentified restriction factor in Jurkat cells and other T cells, provisionally called Lv4 (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). It is conceivable that the gene encoding Lv4 is specifically stimulated by IFN-I in a PML-dependent fashion in Jurkat cells. This characteristic could be exploited to identify this gene, similar to the strategy that led to the identification of Tetherin as a retroviral restriction factor (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).</p>
<p>In our previous study (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we showed that PML inhibited HIV-1 transcription in MEFs but not in Sup-T1 cells and in an IFN-I-independent fashion. We analyzed GFP mean fluorescence intensity in all our experiments for this study, as a surrogate for HIV-1 gene expression levels. Consistent with our previous findings, we observed no effect of PML on the GFP fluorescence intensity following infection of THP-1, Jurkat, HeLa or TE671 cells with our various vectors (not shown). We conclude that PML does not repress HIV-1 transcription in human cells. This apparently contradicts a report by Giacca and colleagues that PML inhibits HIV-1 transcription by directly binding the viral promoter (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, the latter study was based on the use of &#x201C;J-Lat&#x201D; clones, which are Jurkat cells in which the HIV-1 provirus has become constitutively repressed through unknown mechanisms (<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). We propose that PML may be involved in the rare silencing events leading to HIV-1 latency in Jurkat cells, and that PML is important for the maintenance of silencing; however, PML is not a ubiquitous silencer of HIV-1 transcription.</p>
<p>Finally, our study shows that the As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-mediated stimulation of early retroviral infection stages is completely independent of PML, and so is the inhibition of TRIM5&#x03B1; by this drug. This is not entirely surprising, considering that TRIM5&#x03B1; can target N-MLV in human cells, and HIV-1 in MEF cells, in the absence of PML. However, these results challenge conclusions from another paper that used radioactively or chemically labelled arsenate compounds to show that PML was the main target for this group of pharmacological agents (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). How, then, does As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> counteract TRIM5&#x03B1; and, to a lesser extent, stimulate HIV-1 and B-MLV vectors in human cells? Perhaps addressing this long-unanswered question will be helped by an observation that pre-dated the isolation of TRIM5&#x03B1;. Indeed, PK11195, a compound which, like As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, affects mitochondrial functions, also counteracts TRIM5&#x03B1; (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Strikingly, these two drugs enhance autophagy (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), an outcome possibly related to their effect on mitochondria. It is possible that As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-induced autophagy accelerates the lysosomal degradation of TRIM5&#x03B1; and other cytoplasmic restriction factors.</p>

A gRNA targeting the CAG hybrid promoter (target: 5&#x2019;GTTCCGCGTTACATAACTTA) was used as a negative control (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) needed for the generation of pLCv2-based constructs were designed according to the Zhang lab protocol (<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) and are shown in Table S1.</p>
<p>The lentiviral vectors were prepared by co-transfection of 293T cells with 10 &#x03BC;g of the plentiCRISPRv2 construct together with 5 &#x03BC;g of pMD-G and 10 &#x03BC;g of p&#x0394;R8.9 (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The viral supernatants were collected at 1.5 or 2 d post-transfection and used to transduce various cell lines. Stably transduced cells were selected by addition of 0.5 &#x03BC;g/ml puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the medium at 2 d post-infection and for 5 d. Control untransduced cells were killed under these conditions.</p>

<title>Surveyor nuclease assay</title>
<p>To evaluate on-target modifications (indels) in <italic>hPML</italic>, a surveyor nuclease assay was performed. 293T cells were transfected with either plentiCRISPRv2-hPML1, -hPML2 or -CAG using PEI. 3 d later, the genomic DNA was extracted from the transfected cells using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). Two pairs of primers were designed to amplify 637 bp and 725 bp fragments on either side of Cas9 targets guided by gPML1 and gPML2 respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The sequences of these ODNs are included in Table S1. PCR amplicons were heat-denatured at 95 &#x00B0;C, and re-annealed by slow cooling to promote formation of dsDNA heteroduplexes. The heteroduplexes were then cleaved by surveyor nuclease S (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Digestion products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p>

<title>Construction of the homology directed repair (HDR) plasmid and generation of PML-KO Jurkat cells</title>
<p>We used pcDNA3.1&#x002B; as the backbone plasmid to prepare a HDR &#x201C;donor&#x201D; plasmid containing a neomycin selection gene (Neo<sup>R</sup>). First, the backbone plasmid was cut with BamHI and BglII, then self-ligated in order to remove the cytomegalovirus promoter from upstream of the multicloning site MCS1. Next, two ODNs were designed to introduce the second MCS (MCS2) (see Table S1); these ODNs were annealed, and the resulting duplex ligated into the PciI cut site of the plasmid, downstream of Neo<sup>R</sup>, yielding pNMs-Neo.HDR. To construct the PML HDR plasmid, homology arms corresponding to 800 bp-long regions immediately upstream and downstream of the hPML gRNA1-mediated Cas9 cut site in <italic>hPML</italic> were designed. The arms were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA extracted from 293T cells using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). The sequences of ODNs used in the PCR reactions are provided in Table S1. The 5&#x2019; arm was cloned into MCS1 of pNMs-Neo.HDR which had been cut with NotI and XbaI. The plasmid was then cut with Mfe I and Sbf I in order to clone the 3&#x2019; arm into MCS2, yielding pNMs-Neo.HDR-hPML.</p>
<p>Jurkat cells (300,000) were electroporated with 1.5 &#x03BC;g of pNMs-Neo.HDR-hPML together with 1.5 &#x03BC;g of pLCv2-hPML1 using an MP-100 microporator (Digital Bio Technology) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The parameters were 1300 V, 2 pulses, 20 ms. 48 h later, cells were placed in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418, and selection was carried out for 7 d.</p>

<title>Antibodies and WB analyses</title>
<p>Cells (1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup>) were lysed at 4&#x00B0;C in RIPA lysis buffer (1&#x0025; NP40, 0.5&#x0025; deoxycholate, 0.1&#x0025; SDS, 150mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). The lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by WB analysis using mouse anti-mPML mAb (36-1-104, Enzo life sciences, NY), rabbit polyclonal anti-hPML (A301-167A, Bethyl Laboratories, TX), rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (Cell Signaling, MA, USA), or mouse anti-&#x03B2;-actin antibody (Sigma, MI).</p>

<title>Viral challenges and flow cytometric analysis</title>
<p>Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 3&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and infected the following day with GFP-expressing retroviral vectors. HeLa and TE671 cells were trypsinized at 2 d post-infection and fixed in 3&#x0025; formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The percentage of GFP-positive cells was then determined by analyzing 1&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> to 5&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells on a FC500 MPL cytometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) using the CXP Software (Beckman Coulter).</p>

<p>A 0.1 M stock solution of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Sigma) was prepared in 1 N NaOH, as previously described (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and diluted in the culture medium immediately before use. Cells were treated for 15 min prior to infection. 16 h post-infection, the supernatants were replaced with fresh medium devoid of drug. Recombinant human IFN-&#x03B1; was obtained from Shenandoah biotechnology (Warwick, PA). Recombinant human IFN-&#x03B2; and IFN-&#x03C9; were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). IFN-I was added to cell cultures 16 h prior to infection and at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>HeLa or MEF cells were seeded on glass coverslips placed in 3.5-cm wells. MEFs were treated with LMB (20 ng/ml) 3 h prior to infection then infected for 6 h with HIV-1<sub>NL-GFP</sub>. The cells were permeabilized and fixed for 10 min in Triton X-100/4&#x0025; formaldehyde at room temperature (RT), followed by 4 washes with PBS. Cells were then treated with 10&#x0025; goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min at RT followed by 4 h of incubation with antibodies against FLAG (Sigma, 1:150), hPML (Bethyl Laboratories, 1:150) or mPML (Enzo Life Sciences, 1:150) in 10&#x0025; goat serum at RT. They were then washed 4 times with PBS and fluorescently stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:100 in 10&#x0025; goat serum for 1 h at RT. The cells were then washed 4 times with PBS before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Hoechst 33342 (0.8 &#x03BC;g/ml; Molecular Probes) was added along with the penultimate PBS wash to reveal DNA. Images were acquired on an AxioObserver Microscope (Carl Zeiss Canada, Toronto, ON) equipped with the Apotome module.</p>
