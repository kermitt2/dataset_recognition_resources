<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. MRSA resists nearly all &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics that have a bactericidal activity and a signal inducer effect. However, studies have yet to clarify whether the inducer effect of empirically used &#x03B2;-lactams stimulates MRSA pathogenicity in vivo. Here, we showed that a new cluster of tandem lipoprotein genes (<italic>tlpps</italic>) was upregulated in MRSA in response to the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam induction. The increased Tlpps significantly altered immune responses by macrophages with high IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; levels. The deletion of the <italic>tlpps</italic> mutant (N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>) significantly decreased the proinflammatory cytokine levels in vitro and in vivo. The bacterial loads of N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic> in the mouse kidney were also reduced compared with those of the wild type N315. The &#x03B2;-lactam-treated MRSA exacerbated cutaneous infections with increased lesion size, extended illness, and flake-like abscess-formation compared with those of the nontreatment. The &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics that promoted the MRSA pathogenicity were SarA dependent, and the increasing expression of <italic>tlpps</italic> after &#x03B2;-lactam treatment was directly controlled by the global regulator SarA. Overall, our findings suggested that &#x03B2;-lactams should be used carefully because it might lead to a worse outcome of MRSA infection than inaction in the treatment.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>&#x03B2;-lactams are widely used in practice to treat infectious diseases, however, &#x03B2;-lactams worsening the outcome of a certain disease is poorly understood. In this study, we have identified a new cluster of tandem lipoprotein genes (<italic>tlpps</italic>) that is upregulated in the major clinically prevalent MRSA clones in response to the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactams induction. The major highlight in this work is that &#x03B2;-lactams induce SarA expression, and then SarA directly binds to the <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster promoter region and upregulates the <italic>tlpp</italic> expression in MRSA. Moreover, the &#x03B2;-lactam stimulated Tlpps are important virulence factors that enhance MRSA pathogenicity. The deletion of the <italic>tlpps</italic> mutant significantly decreases the proinflammatory cytokine levels in vitro and in vivo. The &#x03B2;-lactam induced Tlpps enhance the host inflammatory responses by triggering the expression of IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1;, thereby promoting bacterial colonization and abscess formation. These data elucidate that &#x03B2;-lactams can worsen the outcome of MRSA infection through the induction of <italic>tlpps</italic> that are controlled by the global regulator SarA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infectious diseases caused by bacteria are common and adversely affect human health worldwide. The discovery of antibiotics for antibacterial application was a remarkable achievement in the 20th century. In the therapeutic use of antibiotics in humans and animals, bacteria encounter wide gradients of antibiotic concentrations in host bodies [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Antibiotics can serve as signal inducers, in addition to their clinically important antibacterial activity, and influence the physiological characteristics of bacteria and trigger various cellular responses in bacterial species. Low levels of antibiotics can induce extracellular DNA release, virulence factor production, and biofilm formation [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], resulting in a worse outcome of bacterial infections. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the stimulation of pathogenicity in a bacterial population at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations should be understood.</p>
<p>Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) is a leading pathogen with notable pathogenic effects. MRSA causes a wide range of diseases, including acute skin and soft tissue infections, chronic and persistent endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MRSA infections cause greater morbidity and mortality than methicillin-susceptible <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) infections do [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Several studies have suggested that as-yet-unidentified virulence factors or inappropriate treatments contribute to the poor outcome of MRSA infections [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that between 30&#x0025; and 80&#x0025; of individuals infected with MRSA are inappropriately treated often with &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics because of the failure to recognize MRSA infection initially [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accumulated data have demonstrated that the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics can promote <italic>S. aureus</italic> pathogenicity by increasing the expression of alpha-toxin [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], enterotoxins [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], or staphylococcal protein A (SPA) in vitro [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, the contribution of the certain altered virulence factor to the MRSA pathogenesis in vivo has yet determined, and the molecular mechanisms underlying &#x03B2;-lactams modulating MRSA pathogenesis remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Lipoproteins (Lpps) are an abundant family of proteins anchored in the bacterial membrane, and they account for at least 2&#x0025; of a bacterial proteome [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>S. aureus</italic> encodes 55-70 putative Lpps, and approximately 50&#x0025; of these Lpps are annotated as chaperones or as transporters for amino acids, peptides, iron, and zinc [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many of the proposed Lpps (more than 30&#x0025;) in <italic>S. aureus</italic> are conserved hypothetical proteins of unknown functions [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Most virulent MRSA strains, such as USA300, carry a conserved genomic island termed vSa&#x03B1; (nonphage and nonstaphylococcal cassette chromosome genomic island) that encodes numerous homologous <italic>lpps</italic> arranged in tandem, which is referred to as &#x201C;tandem lipoproteins&#x201D; (<italic>tlpps</italic>) or &#x201C;lipoprotein-like&#x201D; (<italic>lpl</italic>) [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster likely represents the paralogous genes that have diverged after a duplication event in <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MRSA USA300 belonging to the clonal complex CC8 carries 15 (22&#x0025;) hypothetical Tlpps. Of these Tlpps, 9 are specific to the vSa&#x03B1; genomic island [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. By comparison, N315 belonging to the clonal complex CC5 carries 12 (21&#x0025;) hypothetical Tlpps. Of these Tlpps, 9 Lpl proteins are specific to the vSa&#x03B1; genomic island (S1 Table).</p>
<p>Some staphylococcal Lpps can trigger host cell invasion, increase bacterial pathogenicity, and contribute to the epidemic of CC8 and CC5 strains [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the exact roles of the Tlpp proteins are unclear. Whether these Tlpp proteins can be induced by the subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics and contribute to the pathogenesis of MRSA have yet to be determined. In this study, we demonstrated that a new <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster of MRSA was upregulated in response to the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam induction. The increased Tlpps in MRSA significantly altered immune responses by increasing the IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; levels of the macrophages. Null Tlpp MRSA mutant infection decreased the IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; levels in serum and the bacterial burdens in kidney of a mouse model. &#x03B2;-lactam-treated MRSA N315 exhibited an increased pathogenicity with severe cutaneous infection and abscess formation. Moreover, the &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics that promoted pathogenicity in MRSA were SarA dependent, and the increasing Tlpp expression after &#x03B2;-lactam treatment was directly controlled by the global regulator SarA.</p>

<title>&#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics stimulated tandem lipoprotein expression in MRSA</title>
<p>It is reported that the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics can induce the production of some <italic>S. aureus</italic> toxins, such as alpha-toxin [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], PVL [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and enterotoxins [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], or immune evasion molecules, such as SPA [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, <italic>S. aureus</italic> N315, which is a globally prevalent sequence type 5 (ST5) MRSA strain [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], was tested for its antibiotic response to identify new factors contributing to MRSA pathogenesis in antibiotic induction. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics, including oxacillin (OXA), methicillin (MET), cefoxitin (FOX), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MER), chloramphenicol (CHL), vancomycin (VAN), kanamycin (KAN), and erythromycin (ERY) against N315 were determined (S2 Table). The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed that a protein band (approximately 30 kDa) was upregulated in the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam-treated bacteria compared with the nontreatment control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). By contrast, CHL, VAN, KAN, and ERY did not have induction effects on this protein band. Further observations indicated that the subinhibitory concentrations of OXA exerted a broad-spectrum induction effect on other major clinically prevalent MRSA clones, including ST88, ST239, ST59, ST1, and ST398, which displayed the same upregulated protein band as that in the OXA-treated MRSA compared with the nontreatment one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>The protein band was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed through liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to characterize the &#x03B2;-lactam-induced proteins in the MRSA strains. The detected peptides matched with 68 proteins in the N315 proteome (S3 Table). Most known metabolic enzymes were excluded, and three putative Tlpps, namely, Tlpp3 (SA2273), Tlpp2 (SA2274), and Tlpp1(SA2275), encoded by a consecutive gene cluster were selected on the basis of theoretical molecular weights for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref> and S1 Table). SA2273, SA2274, and SA2275 were annotated as hypothetical proteins in the N315 genome (GenBank accession no. BA000018.3). A typical Lpp precursor contained a signal peptide at the N-terminal and a characteristic conserved three-amino acid lipobox in front of the invariable cysteine [(LVI) (ASTG) (GA)&#x2193;<bold>C</bold>] [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Both Tlpp1 and Tlpp3 possessed signal peptides and &#x201C;lipobox&#x201D; sequences, whereas Tlpp2 comprised a transmembrane helix domain at the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1A Fig</xref>). These proteins were annotated as Tlpps belonging to a domain of unknown function (DUF) 576 protein family on the Pfam database [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Considering that Tlpps account for more than 62.6&#x0025; of amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1B Fig</xref>), we prepared recombinant Tlpp1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>) and the corresponding antibodies, and verified the authority of the &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated proteins through Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Although several MRSA clones, such as ST8 and ST239, contained only two of the three <italic>tlpps</italic> in their genomes, the <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster was widely distributed among the major prevalent MRSA clones (S4 Table). This observation was consistent with the finding that several major MRSA clonal strains upregulated Tlpps in response to the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using RNA extracted from MRSA N315 by specific primers to test whether <italic>tlpp1, tlpp2,</italic> and <italic>tlpp3</italic> were co-transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref> and S5 Table). The comparison of the RT-PCR results with the template of the genomic DNA or RNA only revealed that <italic>tlpp1, tlpp2,</italic> and <italic>tlpp3</italic> were co-transcribed from the <italic>tlpp1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). We further examined the influence of &#x03B2;-lactams on <italic>tlpp</italic> expression. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the mRNA levels of <italic>tlpp1, tlpp2,</italic> and <italic>tlpp3</italic> were upregulated in N315 after treatment with the subinhibitory concentrations of OXA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein levels of Tlpps in both N315 total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref> and 2E) and the culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2F</xref> and 2G) increased in a dose-dependent manner after OXA treatment was administered. Tlpp expression was also upregulated by N315 in a dose-dependent manner after MET treatment was given (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the Tlpp expression by N315 increased in a time-dependent manner after OXA treatment was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2H</xref> and 2I). These results verified that MRSA Tlpps could be released from the bacteria and secreted to the culture, and their production was influenced by the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics.</p>

<title>&#x03B2;-lactam-induced Tlpps triggered proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages</title>
<p>In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall-associated lipopolysaccharides are the main molecules involved in activating the innate immune system of hosts via TLR4 interaction [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while in Gram-positive bacteria, the releasable Lpps may be the main factor that exert a similar function by triggering the TLR2-MyD88-NF-&#x03BA;B signaling pathway, thereby inducing proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To determine whether the &#x03B2;-lactam-induced MRSA Tlpps involved in the innate immune activation, we cultured mouse RAW264.7 macrophages in media containing 5&#x0025; culture supernatant of N315 post-treated with different concentrations of OXA for 6 h. We then determined the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1;, in the cell-cultured media (DMEN). The results revealed that IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; levels were gradually increased by macrophages stimulated by the culture supernatant of N315 treated with OXA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref> and 3B). Then, we wondered whether the MRSA Tlpps promoted the cytokine expression in macrophages, a <italic>tlpps</italic> deletion mutant (N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>) with a pYT3-&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic> plasmid and a tlpps-overexpressing strain (N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>/pLI-<italic>tlpps</italic>) with a pLI-<italic>tlpps</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3 Fig</xref>) were constructed for macrophage infection. Results showed that the production of IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; in macrophages significantly decreased after treated with N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic> at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30 compared with those of the wild-type N315 administered. By contrast, higher levels of IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; were detected in macrophages treated with N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>/pLI-<italic>tlpps</italic> but not with N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>, which carried an empty pLI50 vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref> and 3E). Similar results were observed when the bacterial culture supernatant was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3G</xref> and 3H) because of the loss of Tlpp expression in the supernatant of N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3F</xref>), indicating that the increased levels of IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; by macrophages depended on the expression of N315 Tlpps that responded to &#x03B2;-lactams in a dose-dependent manner. However, the recombinant Tlpp1 purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>) exhibited no effect on the levels of IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting that a correctly triacylated Tlpp or a long-chain N-acylated Lpp was needed for the recognition by TLR2-TLR1 receptors to trigger immune response by macrophages [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

<title>&#x03B2;-lactam-antibiotic-stimulated Tlpps promoted the pathogenesis of MRSA</title>
<p>We determined whether &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated Tlpps enhanced the pathogenesis of MRSA. A mouse subcutaneous infection model was used to evaluate the contribution of the subinhibitory concentrations of OXA or Tlpps to skin and soft tissue infections.

The abscesses caused by the OXA-treated N315 was significantly larger than those caused by the OXA-treated N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>, untreated N315, and untreated N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>), and this observation was further shown in the photographs of the skin lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5 Fig</xref>). Histological examinations indicated that the skin of the OXA-treated N315-challenged mice exhibited less extensive inflammation with leukocyte infiltration, destroyed skin structure, and more flake-like abscess-formation than those of the untreated N315-infected and PBS-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MRSA is distinct from MSSA in terms of the acquisition of a genetic element called staphylococcal cassette chromosome <italic>mec</italic> (SCC<italic>mec</italic>) in which <italic>mecA</italic> encodes an alternative penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) with a low affinity for &#x03B2;-lactams [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As such, MRSA strains are resistant to nearly all &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As antibiotics, &#x03B2;-lactams bind to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and inhibit the transpeptidation and transglycosylation of the cell wall, resulting in a weakened cell wall and inducing cell lysis and death [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This type of antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins and &#x03B2;-lactam/&#x03B2;-lactamase inhibitor combinations, has been empirically used for clinical treatments of infectious diseases [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The subinhibitory concentrations of antistaphylococcal agents might arise because of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms or pharmacokinetics of antibiotics [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For MRSA infections, which are not initially recognized, &#x03B2;-lactams are not only ineffective in the treatment of infections but also likely contributing to poor outcomes by enhancing the pathogenicity of MRSA. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, we showed that a three-gene constituent <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster upregulated in response to &#x03B2;-lactam induction in a dose&#x002D; and time-dependent manner. This <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster, belonging to a DUF576 protein family of unknown function [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], was widely distributed among the major prevalent MRSA clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref> and S4 Table). Tlpps could be upregulated after treatment with nearly all &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin (oxacillin and methicillin), cephalosporins (cefoxitin), and carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), but not with vancomycin, kanamycin, and erythromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to antimicrobial activity, signal induction may be implemented by the subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactams. They actively promote <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], induce PBP2a to reduce peptidoglycan crosslinking in MRSA [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and enhance virulence factors, such as alpha-toxins, PVL, SPA, and enterotoxins [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast to &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated SPA and PVL, which have a controversial pathogenic role in <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the Lpps of <italic>S. aureus</italic> are crucial players in alerting the host immune system by recognizing TLR2/TLR1 or TLR2/TLR6 receptors [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In general, the Lpps of Gram-positive bacteria are anchored in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We observed that the &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated MRSA Tlpps could be released; Tlpps could be detected in both cell lysates and the culture supernatant through Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>, 2F, 3C and 3F). MRSA Tlpps could induce the production of IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; proinflammatory cytokines of macrophages which stimulated with the culture supernatant of N315 post-treated with different OXA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref> and 3B). Although the <italic>tlpp</italic> deletion mutant (N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>) infection induced less IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; production in mice compared with the wild-type N315 was administrated, OXA-treated N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic>-infected mice still produced higher IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; cytokines compared with those of the untreated N315-challenged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref> and 5E), suggesting that other mechanisms might be involved in the immune system modulation by &#x03B2;-lactam-treated MRSA. For instance, &#x03B2;-lactam-promoted PBP2a induction can diminish the peptidoglycan crosslinking, thereby enhancing phagocytic degradation and detection and resulting in strong IL-1&#x03B2; production [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to stimulating the immune system, increasing the pathogenicity of MRSA was attributed to &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated Tlpps. In comparison with wild-type N315, the N315&#x0394;<italic>tlpps</italic> strain significantly decreased the bacterial burden in mouse kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>, 4D and 4E). &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotic treatment exacerbated MRSA infections in the mouse skin infection model, and the histological examinations of the OXA-treated N315-challenged mouse skin displayed less extensive infiltration with leukocytes, destroyed skin structure, and easily promoted abscess formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). A possible explanation is that the induced IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; expression by &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated MRSA Tlpps silenced the innate immune responses [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], thereby facilitating MRSA colonization and infection. Our findings might indicate that MRSA infections were associated with higher morbidity and mortality than MSSA [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
<p>&#x03B2;-lactams can induce PVL expression in <italic>S. aureus</italic> by interfering with PBP1 and triggering SarA and Rot global regulators [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our results showed that SarA and AgrA were the most upregulated regulators in MRSA N315 after OXA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). The deletion of SarA (N315&#x0394;<italic>sarA</italic>) failed to upregulate <italic>tlpps</italic> even under OXA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref> and 7B), indicating that the &#x03B2;-lactam-induced Tlpp expression in MRSA was SarA controlled. EMSA data revealed that the regulation of SarA on Tlpp expression was direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7F</xref>). However, further investigations should be performed to clarify how &#x03B2;-lactams trigger the SarA expression.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this work focused on the function and regulation of a new <italic>tlpp</italic> cluster in response to the induction of subinhibitory concentrations of &#x03B2;-lactams. We demonstrated that the increased Tlpps in MRSA significantly enhanced inflammatory response by triggering IL-6 and TNF&#x03B1; levels in vitro and in vivo, thereby possibly contributing to bacterial pathogenicity and worsening the outcome of MRSA infection by reducing host immune responses and promoting bacterial colonization. &#x03B2;-lactam-stimulated MRSA Tlpps was SarA dependent, and the upregulation in Tlpp expression after &#x03B2;-lactam treatment was directly controlled by the global regulator SarA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref>). Nonetheless the pathways leading to the SarA expression trigged by &#x03B2;-lactam antibiotics remain unknown. Our data support the recommendation to clinicians that the discreet usage of &#x03B2;-lactams which possibly worsened the clinical outcome of MRSA infections.</p>
