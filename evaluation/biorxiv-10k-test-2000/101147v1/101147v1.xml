Here, we present flexible and efficient strategies for gene cloning and vector construction using overlap PCR. We firstly cloned the open reading frames (ORFs) of the porcine <italic>MSTN</italic>, chicken <italic>OVA</italic> and human <italic>&#x03B1;-glucosidase</italic> genes by overlap PCR-based assembling of their exons, which could be amplified with genomic DNAs as the templates without RNA extraction and RT-PCR reaction. Secondly, we generated additionally three designed functional cassettes by overlap PCR-based assembling of different DNA elements, which facilitated the construction their expression vectors greatly. Moreover, we further developed an interesting overlap-circled PCR method for fast plasmid vector construction without any cutting and ligating procedure.

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene cloning and vector construction are the foundational and routine technologies for molecular biological research. The first step for studying a particular gene is usually to clone it from the cDNA using RT-PCR, and routinely the next step is to construct corresponding expression vector by restrictive endonuclease-based digestion and ligase-based ligation. The restrictive endonuclease-ligase dependent strategy for gene cloning has been deeply developed and widely used. However, there are inherently several limitations, such as the requirement of high-qualified cDNA template for desired gene cloning, the inconvenience for simultaneous multiple gene cloning and the limited restriction enzyme sites available on the backbone plasmid for vector construction. Multiple fragment cloning can be achieved by enzymatic assembly of overlapping DNA fragments with the alternative application of 5&#x02B9;-exonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and by Golden Gate cloning using type IIs restrictive enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides, a series of nuclease or/and ligase-independent strategies for constructing vectors based on different characteristics of intent terminal sequences has been developed, such as the enzyme-free cloning using annealing tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], the T-A cloning applying special ends of PCR products[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], the UDG or USER cloning with Uracil DNA glycosylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], the Gateway cloning dependent on bacterial homologous recombination (HR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], the mating-assisted genetically integrated cloning (MAGIC) using bacterial <italic>in vivo</italic> site-specific endonuclease cleavage and HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and the sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC) using <italic>in vitro</italic> HR and single-strand annealing (SSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Although these methods mentioned above all have their own applications and advantages, new improvements leading to more flexible, feasible, convenient and economical approaches for gene cloning and vector construction are still needed.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrated that the open reading frame (ORFs) of functional genes could be assembled with exon amplicons from genomic DNA using overlap PCR strategy, which is useful and practical for amplifying long eukaryotic genes interrupted by introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Besides, multiple genes or DNA elements are sometimes required to be cloned into a single plasmid vector, which is always inconvenient with multiple cloning steps and confined by limited cloning sites available. The overlap PCR strategy could be effective for assembling these genes or elements. We further demonstrated that the overlap-circled PCR could be used to assemble the intent DNA fragment and the plasmid backbone for vector construction.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Cloning eukaryotic genes by overlap PCR-based assembling of their exons</title>
<p>Firstly, we tried to clone the ORF of porcine <italic>MSTN</italic> gene (NC&#x005F;010457) by the overlap PCR strategy. Myostatin is a myokine protein released by myocytes to inhibit myogenesis and the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene contains 3 exons and 3 introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1A</xref>). Generally, to obtain the 1128 bp CDS, the exons were amplified respectively via PCR with porcine genomic DNA as template and were assembled one by one via overlap PCR. The principle for designing overlap PCR primers is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1B</xref>. The 3 exons were amplified with primer pairs of exon 1-F/exon 1-R, exon 2-F/exon 2-R, and exon 3-F/exon 3-R respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref>). The PCR products of these 3 exons were purified by gel extraction, and further served as the templates for generating the whole ORF fragment of <italic>MSTN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1C</xref>) by the second overlap PCR step (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig.S2) with primers exon 1-F and exon 3-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>). This technique makes gene cloning simply by exon-ligation through overlap PCR without RNA extraction and RT-PCR, and can be applied widely for amplifying various eukaryotic gene interrupted by introns for molecular biology study.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility, the chicken ovalbumin gene (NM205152, <italic>OVA</italic>) containing 8 interval exons (with the codon ATG in exon 2) inlayed in the 7573 bp genomic DNA was assembled similarly. Seven pairs of overlap PCR primers were designed as described above. The 1161 bp ORF of <italic>OVA</italic> gene was generated by assembling fragments from exon 2 to exon 8 (Supplementary Fig.S1A and S1B). We next successfully assembled the 2132 bp ORF of human <italic>&#x03B1;-glucosidase</italic> gene with 11 exons (Supplementary Fig.S1C and S1D). Actually, in addition to the two-step overlap PCR procedure described above, the intent ORF fragments of the two genes could also obtained by one-step overlap PCR simply pooling all the overlap PCR primers, the genomic DNA template and the PCR regents together in a single tube. These studies suggested that the overlap PCR strategy is effective and practical for amplifying long eukaryotic genes interrupted by introns, which may be more convenient and economical when applied in the further studies.</p>

<sec id="s2b"><title>Cloning functional cassettes by overlap PCR-based assembling of different DNA elements</title>
<p>In order to further verify the advantage of the overlap PCR strategy, we tried to assemble different DNA elements rapidly to generate designed functional cassettes. Firstly, the SV40P.neo-IRES-tk-polyA cassette was designed and constructed. Three pairs of overlapping primer were designed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2A</xref>. The SV40P.neo, IRES and tk-polyA fragments were amplified from plasmid DNA through touch-down PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and purified by gel extraction routinely. The whole 3.3 kb fragment was generated by overlap PCR with primers at the ends using the three fragments as the templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Secondly, we tried to assemble a larger Tet.SV40T-T2A-p53-polyA cassette, which was intended to be 5.7 kb in length. Five pairs of overlapping primers were designed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2C</xref>. Corresponding DNA elements were PCR amplified from either plasmid DNA or genomic DNA, and were assembled together successfully by overlap PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2D</xref>). Furthermore, by using the overlap PCR strategy, we also obtained the zinc finger cassette with three fingers for targeting the <italic>CCR5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>). The successful assembly of different DNA elements through overlap PCR will facilitate the fast cloning of functional cassette by avoiding multiple cloning steps.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Fast plasmid vector construction by overlap-circled PCR</title>
<p>In another attempt, we obtained a circle plasmid containing the selective marker gene and the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene expression cassette through overlap-circled PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.3</xref>). To begin with, the backbone plasmid pBlueScript (Addgene) containing the <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> gene and pUC replication initiation site was amplified with primers pBlue-F/pBlue-R. Then the ORF of eukaryotic <italic>MSTN</italic> gene was cloned by the two-step overlap PCR strategy as described above. Finally, the pBlueScript backbone fragment and the <italic>MSTN</italic> ORF fragment were overlapped by circled PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] using the <italic>pfu</italic> DNA polymerase without primers for generating the pBlueScript-MSTN construct, which was used to transform the <italic>E.coli</italic> JM109 competent cells for the amplification. Then plasmid DNA was extracted from culture of positive colonies, the digesting assay with <italic>Eco</italic>R I/<italic>Xho</italic> I restrictive enzymes was conducted and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm the positive plasmid clones. The results revealed that 4 out of the 12 clones (33.3&#x0025;) were positive. Here, we demonstrated a useful overlap-circled PCR method for fast vector construction, through only two or three PCR procedures without using any ligase and endonuclease.</p>

<p>The <italic>Amp<sup>r</sup></italic> marker gene and the pUC replication initiation site of pBlueScript backbone were amplified by normal PCR and the MSTN fragment was generated by overlap PCR as described above. The pBlueScript backbone fragment and the MSTN fragment were overlapped by circled PCR using the pfu DNA polymerase without primers for generating the pBlueScript-MSTN construct. <italic>E.coli</italic> JM109 were transformed with the product for cloning and the gel represents the result of digesting assay with <italic>Eco</italic>R I/<italic>Xho</italic> I.

<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we firstly cloned the ORFs of genes porcine <italic>MSTN</italic>, chicken <italic>OVA</italic> and human <italic>&#x03B1;-glucosidase</italic> by overlap PCR-based assembling their exons. Secondly, we successfully obtained several functional cassettes by assembling different DNA elements from plasmid or genomic DNA. Thus, the first advantage of the overlap PCR strategy is that it is much convenient and cost-effective to conduct gene cloning without RNA extraction and RT-PCR, and the cloning can be even achieved by one step overlap PCR procedure. The second advantage is that functional cassettes can be generated by quickly assembling corresponding DNA elements, facilitating the fast cloning of complicated cassettes by avoiding multiple cloning steps. Finally, we further demonstrated an interesting overlap-circled PCR method for fast vector construction with only PCR procedures, which makes the vector construction much easier and more economic by simply designing several pairs of primers without using any ligase and endonuclease. To sum up, our work demonstrated that the overlap PCR strategy can be flexible, effective, convenient and economical for gene cloning and vector construction.</p>

<p>The genome DNAs prepared from tissues (pig and chicken) was shown as follows and that from cultured cells (human 293T) was manipulated similarly without the digestion. Digest approximately 2 mm<sup>3</sup> tissues with 300 &#x03BC;L digestion buffer [5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2&#x0025; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] with 0.4 mg proteinase K/1 mL digestion buffer, in a 1.5 mL tube at 55 &#x00B0;C overnight. Add an equal volume (about 300 &#x03BC;L) of phenol/chloroform to each sample, and vortex for 30 seconds. Centrifuge at room temperature at max speed for 5 minutes to separate phases. Transfer the upper phase of each sample to a fresh tube. Add 1 mL 100&#x0025; ethanol into each tube, mix completely. Centrifuge at max speed for 10 minutes, and then pour out the ethanol. Wash the DNA pellets by adding 1 mL 70&#x0025; ethanol into the tubes, then centrifuge at max speed for 10 minutes. Pour out the ethanol from the tubes, immediately dissolve the DNA pellets with 50 &#x03BC;L TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, pH 7.5) after air-drying.</p>

<sec id="s4c"><title>Overlap PCR for assembling exons and DNA fragments</title>
<p>The individual exons and DNA element fragments were amplified through standard PCR procedure and reaction system (15&#x03BC;L) as shown in Supplementary Table2. The overlap PCR for assembling exons and different DNA fragments were performed in 50&#x03BC;L reaction system (Supplementary Table2) using the touch-down PCR procedure (Supplementary Fig.S2). Briefly, the touch-down PCR parameters used were as follows: pre-denaturation at 95&#x00B0;C for 5 minutes; followed by 18 touch-down cycles of denaturation at 95&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds, annealing at 68&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds with one degree reduction in each cycle, and polymerization at 72&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds; then, 25 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds, annealing at 50&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds, and polymerization at 72&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds; and a final incubation for 10 minutes at 72&#x00B0;C; end with 10&#x00B0;C incubation. PCR products were purified by gel extraction using the kit according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (OMEGA; Guangzhou, China). All primers used in this work were ordered from Genscript (Nanjing, China) and the sequence information was shown in Supplementary Table1.</p>

<sec id="s4d"><title>Vector construction by overlap-circled PCR</title>
<p>For the plasmid vector construction by overlap-circled PCR, the plasmid backbone and the insertion fragments with overlapping ends were firstly obtained by respectively normal and overlap PCR amplification.

Positive colonies were picked and cultured for plasmid DNA extraction using the kit (OMEGA; Guangzhou, China). The digesting assay with <italic>Eco</italic>R I/<italic>Xho</italic> I restrictive enzymes and agarose gel electrophoresis was conducted to confirm the positive plasmid clones.</p>
