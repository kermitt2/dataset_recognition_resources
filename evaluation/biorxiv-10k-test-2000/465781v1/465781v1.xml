<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Cell-cell communication via gap junctions regulates a wide range of physiological processes by enabling the direct intercellular electrical and chemical coupling. However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> distribution and function of gap junctions remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of non-invasive tools with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Here we developed PARIS (<underline>p</underline>airing <underline>a</underline>ctuators and <underline>r</underline>eceivers to optically <underline>i</underline>solate gap junctions), a new fully genetically encoded tool for measuring the cell-specific gap junctional coupling (GJC). PARIS successfully enabled monitoring of GJC in several cultured cell lines under physiologically relevant conditions and in distinct genetically defined neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, with &#x007E;10-sec temporal resolution and sub-cellular spatial resolution. These results demonstrate that PARIS is a robust, highly sensitive tool for mapping functional gap junctions and study their regulation in both health and disease.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Gap junctions are intercellular channels that are expressed in virtually all tissue types in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They allow direct transfer of small molecules such as ions, metabolites and second messengers between connected cells, thereby playing essential roles in various physiological processes, including embryo development, metabolic coordination of avascular organs, tissue homeostasis and synchronizing electrical activity in excitable tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bennett and Zukin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kumar and Gilula, 1996</xref>). Defects of gap junction function are linked with a wide array of diseases, including myocardial infarction, hearing loss and hypomyelinating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jongsma and Wilders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Laird, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sohl et al., 2005</xref>). Studying gap junction coupling (GJC) under physiological or disease conditions in complex systems such as the nervous system requires a non-invasive method with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Current methods used to monitor GJC include paired electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Furshpan and Potter, 1959</xref>), dye microinjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stewart, 1978</xref>), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wade et al., 1986</xref>), and local activation of molecular fluorescent probes (LAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dakin et al., 2005</xref>), all of which are either invasive and/or lack cell-type specificity, thus limiting their use in heterogeneous tissues. Recently, hybrid approaches have been developed in which genetically encoded hydrolytic enzymes or promiscuous transporters are used to introduce small molecule substrates or peptides tagged with a fluorescent label in specific cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qiao and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). Although these methods might provide cell type specific investigation of GJC, the requirement of exogenous substrate and the background generated by endogenous enzymes or transporters still make them difficult to apply <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, dye diffusion is an irreversible process and thus these methods are difficult to be applied to examine the same gap junctions repeatedly in order to measure their dynamics, regulations and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dong et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, we developed an all-optical approach named PARIS (<underline>p</underline>airing <underline>a</underline>ctuators and <underline>r</underline>eceivers to optically <underline>is</underline>olate gap junctions) in which we express an optically-controlled actuator in one cell, to generate an electrochemical gradient of specific molecules between two connected cells, and a fluorescent receiver in the adjacent cell, to detect the movement of the molecules across the gap junctions. GJC between the actuator cell (i.e., expressing actuators) and the receiver cell (i.e., expressing receivers) is detected by a fluorescence increase in the receiver followed by the optical activation of the actuator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Development of a novel all-optical tool for monitoring GJC</title>
<p>At the beginning, we tested several pairs of optical actuators/receivers based on generating/detecting small molecules that can readily diffuse across gap junctions, such as cGMP, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and proton (H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). Our first step was to test whether the actuator/receiver pair can generate a cell-autonomous signal. We found that, when co-expressed in HEK293T cells (i.e., in the <italic>cis</italic> configuration), neither a light-activated cGMP cyclase BeCylOp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gao et al., 2015</xref>) paired with a cGMP sensor FlincG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhargava et al., 2013</xref>) nor the red shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) paired with a sensitive Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> indicator GCamP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) could generate detectable light-induced signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, when we co-expressed a light-gated outward proton pump ArchT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 2011</xref>) and a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>) in HEK293T cells, a 4-sec laser illumination at 561 nm elicited a robust increase in pHluorin fluorescence, with the membrane-targeted pHluorin (pHluorinCAAX) producing a larger change in fluorescence than the cytosolic pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). No light-induced change in fluorescence was observed in cells that co-expressing pHluorinCAAX and the deficient proton-pump ArchTD95N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kralj et al., 2012</xref>), or in cells that only express pHluorinCAAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Furthermore, the evoked response is dependent on both the duration and the power of the activating light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2C-F</xref>). These results demonstrate that ArchT and pHluorin can function as a pair of proton actuator and proton sensor.</p>
<p>We next examined whether PARIS based on ArchT/pHluorin can be used to measure GJC between cultured HEK293T cells, which endogenously express both connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx45, therefore spontaneously form gap junctions between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Butterweck et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Langlois et al., 2008</xref>). When ArchT and pHluorin were separately expressed in neighboring cells (i.e., in the <italic>trans</italic> configuration, see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B1</xref>), a brief photoactivation of ArchT in the actuator cells (4 sec, &#x007E;0.5 mW, indicated by the yellow circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2</xref>) faithfully induced a &#x007E;4.3&#x0025; &#x2206;F/F<sub>0</sub> increase in pHluorinCAAX fluorescence in the neighboring receiver cells whereas non-adjacent pHluorinCAAX-expressing cells had no measurable change in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2-3</xref>). Application of carbenoxolone (CBX, 100&#x03BC;M) which blocks gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Connors, 2012</xref>) significantly decreased the light-induced PARIS signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that the signal measured in receiver cells is mediated by GJC. Similar to autonomous signals, increasing the duration of the illumination pulse from 1 sec to 20 sec incrementally increased the PARIS response from &#x007E;2&#x0025; to &#x007E;20&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). A 4-sec laser pulse was sufficient to induce a robust PARIS signal (SNR &#x003D; 23 &#x00B1; 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) with a half-rise time of &#x007E;10 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). On the other hand, a 20-sec laser pulse induced an &#x007E;4.3-fold increase in the signal-to-noise ratio compared to 4-sec with a half-rise time of &#x007E;21 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>); however, the half-decay time did not differ between a 4-sec pulse and a 20-sec pulse (t1/2 decay &#x003D; 61 &#x00B1; 5s and 67 &#x00B1; 3s respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We also observed the spatially graded PARIS signals in three receiver cells that are sequentially connected to the actuator cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S3">Figure 1 - figure supplement 3</xref>). Specifically, the directly connected cell had the strongest response, and the thirdly connected cell had the weakest response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S3">Figure 1 - figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>We then quantified the ArchT-induced pH change in the actuator cells using the ratiometric pH indicator mTagBFP-pHluorinCAAX generated by fusing the pH-insensitive blue fluorescent protein mTagBFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Subach et al., 2008</xref>) to the N-terminus of pHluorinCAAX and then calibrating the correlation between pH and the ratio of GFP/BFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S4">Figure 1 - figure supplement 4</xref>). Based on a fit to the titration curve, we estimated that a 4-sec and 20-sec laser pulse induces a transient increase of intracellular pH from 7.35 to 7.45 and 7.80 respectively in actuator cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S4">Figure 1 - figure supplement 4D-F</xref>), which allowed us to repeatedly elicit a PARIS signal in specific cells as shown above. Together, these data provide proof-of-principle that PARIS is a robust tool for measuring GJC between connected cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Electrophysiological validation of PARIS and its comparison with FRAP in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>We have showed that PARIS could detect GJC in a photostimulation dependent way and sensitive to CBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, D1 &#x0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Next, we further validated PARIS by patch-clamping the receiver cell in order to record the gap junction&#x2012; mediated current induced by activating the actuator cell using a laser pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1</xref>). Applying increasingly stronger light pulses to the actuator cell yielded time-locked currents in the receiver cell that were blocked by CBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B2, D2</xref>). In the same cells, voltage steps on the actuator cell also elicited non-rectifying and CBX sensitive currents in the receiver cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D3</xref>). Quantification of the group data showed that the CBX inhibition of GJC was independent from the approaches used to activate the actuator cell (by light or voltage) and from the signals measured in the receiver cell (pHluorinCAAX fluorescence or currents) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, we performed a head-to-head comparison between PARIS and FRAP&#x2014;a dye diffusion based methods which detects the gap junction mediated fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The PARIS signal was stable for five sequential pulses at 2-min intervals, whereas the FRAP signal decayed considerably over the same time period in terms of both basal fluorescence and SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-I</xref>). Moreover, the PARIS signal had considerably faster kinetics than FRAP, with a half-rise time of 21 sec compared to 197 sec, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>

<title>PARIS enables reporting regulations of gap junction and disease-causing mutations in connexin genes</title>
<p>Phosphorylation has been implicated in the modulation of GJC by affecting the trafficking, assembly/disassembly, degradation and gating of gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Laird, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nihei et al., 2010</xref>). To test whether PARIS could report GJC under different regulations such as protein phosphorylation, we treated PARIS-expressing HEK293T cells with the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP, the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin, or the protein kinase C (PKC) agonist tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). Compared with the control group, treating cells with TPA significantly inhibited the PARIS signal compared to the control group; in contrast, neither 8-Br-cAMP nor forskolin had obvious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), suggesting that activating PKC&#x2014;but not protein kinase A&#x2014;inhibits GJC, which is in general consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lampe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sirnes et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Mutations in <italic>GJA1</italic>, the gene encoding Cx43, have been linked to a number of diseases such as the inherited oculodentodigital dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Paznekas et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore asked whether PARIS could be used to probe the function of Cxs encoded by mutated Cx genes. We performed PARIS in HeLa cells, which do not express measurable levels of endogenous Cxs (Elfgang et al., 1995). As expected, no PARIS signal was elicited in receiver HeLa cells upon photoactivating the actuator cell; while in HeLa cells expressing GJA1, photoactivating the actuator cell elicited a robust fluorescence increase in the adjacent receiver cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Interestingly, expressing a Cx43 protein with either the R202H or R76H mutation&#x2014;which affects Cx43 trafficking and gap junction permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shibayama et al., 2005</xref>)&#x2014;caused a significant reduction in the PARIS signal compared to cells expressing wild-type Cx43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). These data indicate that PARIS can be used to probe the effects of clinically relevant mutations in gap junction proteins.</p>

<title>PARIS can report the activity of functional gap junctions between cardiomyocytes</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether PARIS can be used to study gap junctions in a physiologically relevant system, namely cardiomyocytes (CMs). Gap junctions formed by Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 play an important role in CMs by synchronizing their contractions and defects in these connexins have been associated with cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jongsma and Wilders, 2000</xref>). Using CMs cultured from neonatal rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we observed that stimulating actuator CMs induced a robust fluorescence increase in receiver CMs with half-rise and half-decay times of approximately 14 and 21 sec respectively, and the responses were reversibly blocked by the gap junction blocker heptanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garcia-Dorado et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure. 3F-H</xref>). Neither the rate of spontaneous Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> transients in CMs nor the rate of cellular beating was altered by the expression or stimulation of the actuator protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the notion that expressing and activating PARIS does not affect cellular functions.</p>

<p>We then used PARIS to measure electrical synapses formed between excitatory projection neurons (ePNs) and excitatory local neurons (eLNs), both of which have dendritic arborizations in the antennal lobe (AL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shang et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>, first row). We generated a transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> line expressing the actuator (GH146-QF>QUAS-ArchT) selectively in ePNs and the receiver (Kras-Gal4>UAS-pHluorinCAAX) selectively in eLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Stimulating a 20-&#x03BC;m diameter region in the AL elicited a rapid increase in pHluorinCAAX fluorescence, with half-rise and half-decay times of approximately 12 sec and 29 sec, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C, F, G</xref>), consistent with previously reported electrophysiological data indicating that ePNs and eLNs are electrically coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>).

Next, we divided the AL into four regions based on orientation and then scanned each region, revealing that laser illumination can induce a fluorescence increase in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E, H</xref>), indicating that electrical coupling is a general property between ePNs and eLNs in the AL. In addition, we examined gap junction activity between ePNs and other cell types by pairing ePNs as the receiver cells with various actuator cells that have anatomical overlap with ePNs, including inhibitory local neurons (iLNs), glial cells, and Keyon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4 &#x2013; figure supplement 2</xref>, second-bottom rows). However, when activated, none of these three cell types caused a measurable PARIS signal in the receiver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3">Figure 4 &#x2013; figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that ePNs may not form functional gap junction connections with iLNs, glial cells, or Keyon cells.</p>

<title>PARIS can be used to map functional gap junctions in distinct neuronal structures</title>
<p>Electrical coupling between neurons could happen through dendritic networks, axon-axonal connections or somatic contacts, which contribute the signal integration and decision of neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belousov and Fontes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>). Capitalizing on the entire optical nature of PARIS, we further examined whether PARIS can be used to measure functional GJC in subcellular compartments, thereby providing spatial resolution that is not accessible to traditional methods such as electrophysiological recording or dye injection. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, ventrally localized inhibitory projection neurons (iPNs) and ePNs form gap junctions participating odor information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Anatomically, both ePNs and iPNs have dendrites in the AL and axons that project to the lateral horn (LH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Parnas et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, whether gap junctions are formed between iPNs and ePNs in the AL, LH, or both is currently unknown. To answer this question, we expressed the actuator (Mz699-Gal4>UAS-ArchT) in iPNs and the receiver (GH146-QF>QUAS-pHluorinCAAX) in ePNs. We then separately illuminated ePNs-iPNs overlapping regions in the AL or LH to test the presence of functional GJC. Interestingly, stimulating the AL&#x2014;but not the LH&#x2014;elicited a significant increase in pHluorinCAAX fluorescence, and this response was eliminated in the presence of CBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-D</xref>). As a control, we confirmed that CBX had no significant influence on the autonomous signal measured at either the AL or LH when both the actuator and receiver were co-expressed in iPNs (i.e., in the <italic>cis</italic> configuration; Mz699>ArchT/pHluorin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C, F</xref>). These results support the notion that iPNs and ePNs form functional gap junctions at the AL (i.e., via dendrite-dendrite contacts), but not at the LH (i.e., via axon-axon contacts).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Here, we developed a new tool named PARIS, an all-optical approach that can facilitate mapping GJC in specific cells. We show that PARIS can be readily adapted for use in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparations, including cultured cell lines, primary cardiomyocytes, and transgenic flies. We validated that this system specifically reports functional gap junctions using a variety of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches. By focusing on defined sets of neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, we show that as the first completely genetically encoded method, PARIS can be applied to repeatedly probe electrical synapses in distinct, genetically tractable neurons with high temporal resolution (on the order of &#x007E;10 sec) and high spatial resolution.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Advantages of PARIS over existing techniques</title>
<p>First, PARIS relies solely on light and therefore is virtually non-invasive compared with existing methods including paired-recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bennett et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Furshpan and Potter, 1959</xref>), dye microinjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Stewart, 1978</xref>) and scrape loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">el-Fouly et al., 1987</xref>). In addition, given that the activation of the actuator can be specific to subcellular resolution, PARIS can provide spatial information of the functional gap junctions, as shown by our ability to functionally map gap junctions formed at dendrite-dendrite contacts in AL but not at axon-axon contacts in LH between ePNs and iPNs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), while such resolution cannot be easily achieved by any of the previously existed method.</p>
<p>With respect to those relatively non-invasive methods which rely on the diffusion of small fluorescent dyes across gap junctions such as FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wade et al., 1986</xref>) and LAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dakin et al., 2005</xref>), a significant advantage of PARIS is that it is fully reversible and does not require the delivery of exogenous dyes. PARIS may serve as a robust tool for screening existing and newly developed gap junction blockers and/or modulators, including clinically relevant compounds such as inhibitors of PKC signaling. In addition, PARIS could possibly be applied to study the dynamic regulation of gap junctions <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as the formation and break of gap junction connections during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arumugam et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the actuator and receiver proteins in PARIS are both genetically encoded. Recently, several innovative hybrid approaches were developed to monitor gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang and Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qiao and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). Using a channel/transporter/enzyme-dependent step for the transfer of small molecules, these approaches can in principle achieve genetic specificity in terms of targeting defined cells. In practice, however, these methods require the addition of an exogenous substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qiao and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tian et al., 2012</xref>) or a patch electrode to establish an electrochemical gradient between connected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang and Baker, 2016</xref>), thereby limiting their application, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, all of the components in PARIS are genetically encoded by relatively small genes, vastly increasing the range of cell types in which they can be selectively expressed. For example, we show that the PARIS proteins can be introduced using transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1-3</xref>), virus-mediated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and <italic>ex vivo</italic> transgenic labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> &#x0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Given that similar transgenic tools are available for higher organisms, including mammals, PARIS can easily be adapted to other preparations and animal models, including the highly complex mammalian nervous system. In mammalian systems and model organisms in which transgenic techniques are currently unavailable or impractical, recombinant viruses such as lentiviruses, retroviruses, and adeno-associated viruses can be conveniently packaged with these genetic components and used to infect the appropriate target cells.</p>

<title>Limitations of PARIS</title>
<p>In most animal cells, intracellular pH is believed to be tightly regulated for optimal biochemical reactions; thus, even a small change in intracellular pH is rapidly restored to a set point by buffers and proton exchangers/transporters located on the membrane of cells or intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann and Simonsen, 1989</xref>). This robust system for maintaining pH homeostasis enabled us to repeatedly elicit a PARIS signal in both cultured cells and transgenic animals. One caveat to our approach may be the ability of pH to regulate gap junction activity during PARIS. The uncoupling effect of acidic intracellular pH on GJC has long been described across different Cx consisted gap junctions while alkalization was reported to increase the junctional conductance and the total number of opened channels in gap junction plagues (Palacios-Prado et al., 2010; Turin and Warner, 1977). For the mostly wide expressed Cx43 channels, it has a pKa of &#x007E;6.7 in oocytes and fully closed when pH is under 6.4 while fully open when pH is above 7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Peracchia, 2004</xref>), which enables PARIS measurement to reveal the GJC mediated by Cx43. However, there is one type of gap junctions that has been reported to be sensitive to alkalization&#x2014;Cx36 consisted gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gonzalez-Nieto et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the reported pH-conductance curve, the junctional conductance decreased to 50&#x0025; when pH increase 0.8 unit from 7.2 to 8. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S4">Figure 1&#x2013;figure supplement 4</xref>, 0.1-unit pH increase from 7.35 to 7.45 was enough to induce PARIS signal. So PARIS is still possible in reporting Cx36 consisted GJC under proper activation of the actuator. An even more sensitive pH indicator could help us minimize the pH influence.</p>
<p>As we have demonstrated, PARIS is powerful as a genetic tool to map gap junction connections between targeted neurons in the complex central nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> &#x0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). To map unknown gap junctions, firstly we need anatomic information about the two group of cells that we concern to make sure they are spatially contacted, which could be achieved by immunostaining or EM. As the intensive efforts have been or being made to create whole brain connectomes from <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (FlyEM project, janelia) to zebra fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hildebrand et al., 2017</xref>) and mice (Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas), PARIS could utilize these information and databases and possibly help creating electrical connectome.</p>
<p>Lastly, PARIS requires the exclusive expression of the actuator and receiver in different cells. Such genetic tools specifically labeling two distinct groups of cells from different cell types or two subgroups from one cell type, might not be accessible in mammals. However, this limitation can be overcome by the intersectional non-overlapping expression of the actuator and receiver, for example using flp-out system. By fusing the receiver with a flippase, the frt sequence flanked actuator would not express in the presence of the receiver. Meanwhile the receiver and the actuator can both designed to be turned on in a cre-dependent manner. This design could make PARIS more versatile in detecting GJC between different cell types labeled by two cre-lines or within the same cell type labeled by one cre-line, without the contamination of the autonomous signal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Future perspectives</title>
<p>Future refinements to PARIS include the use of the new actuators we have screened combining a receiver with higher pH sensitivity, thereby increasing both the signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution, allowing for an even wider range of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. Finally, the use of additional spectrally non-overlapping pairs of proton-related actuators and receivers, as well as developing actuator-receiver pairs that transport and detect other gap junction&#x2012;permeable small molecules, may provide the opportunity to detect gap junctions between multiple cell types and/or structures.</p>

<title>Molecular cloning</title>
<p>All plasmids were constructed using the Gibson assembly(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) method. In brief, plasmid vectors and inserts were amplified by PCR using &#x007E;30-bp overlapping primers. The fragments were assembled using T5 exonuclease, Phusion DNA polymerase, and Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). All sequences were verified using Sanger sequencing in our in-house facility (sequencing platform in the School of Life Sciences of the Peking University). For cultured cell expression experiments, genes were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector unless otherwise noted. ArchT was amplified from pAAV-CAG-ArchT-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Han et al., 2011</xref>), codon-optimized rhodopsin genes from different species were synthesized by Qinglan Biotec then fused at the C-terminus with BFP2, a trafficking sequence (TS), and an ER export sequence (ERex), producing Actuator-BFP2. In addition, ArchT was linked directly with a TS and ERex and then fused with mRuby3, yielding pcDNA3.1-ArchT-P2A-mRuby3. mTagBFP was fused to the N-terminus of pHluorinCAAX to generate pcDNA3.1-mTagBFP-pHluorinCAAX. The <italic>GJA1</italic> gene was amplified from a cDNA library (hORFeome database 8.1) and fused with RFP (pHuji) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) via a P2A linker to generate pHuji-P2A-GJA1, which was then cloned into the N3 expression vector. Mutations in ArchT and GJA1 were introduced using overlapping PCR with primers containing the mutations of interest. To generate transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines, the following four plasmids were used: ArchT (linked with mRuby3CAAX, HA tag and Flag tag: ArchT-HA-TS-ERex-P2A-mRuby3-Flag-CAAX) and pHluorinCAAX were cloned into pJFRC28-10xUAS vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pfeiffer et al., 2012</xref>)/pJFRC28-5xQUAS vector (made by replacing 10xUAS with 5XQUAS in pJFRC28) respectively, yielding UAS/QUAS-ArchT and UAS/QUAS-pHluorin transgenic flies.</p>

<title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
<p>HEK293T cells and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10&#x0025; (v/v) FBS and 1&#x0025; penicillin-streptomycin (all from Gibco) at 37&#x00B0;C in humidified air containing 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. For transfection, cells were plated at 50&#x0025; confluence on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates; 12-24 h after plating, the cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI), with a typical ratio of 1 &#x03BC;g DNA: 3 &#x03BC;g PEI per well; 6 h after transfection (or 2 h after transfection for electrophysiological experiments), the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and the cells were incubated for an additional 18-24 h prior to imaging or electrophysiological recording. For PARIS transfection, the ArchT-BFP2 and pHluorinCAAX constructs were transfected in separate wells; 6 h after transfection, the cells were dissociated, mixed by pipette, combined into a single well, and incubated for 24 h prior to imaging. Alternatively, in some experiments we used sequential transfection, in which the cells were first transfected with the pHluorinCAAX construct; 6 h later, the medium was changed and the cells were transfected with the ArchT-BFP2 construct. The medium was changed 6 h later, and the cells were incubated for 24 h prior to imaging.</p>
<p>For PARIS measurements in HeLa cells, 0.5 &#x03BC;g pHluorinCAAX was mixed with 0.5 &#x03BC;g pHuji-P2A-GJA1 (or the R202H or R76H mutant version) and transfected into the cells; 10 h later, the medium was replaced with new medium and the cells were transfected with 0.5 &#x03BC;g ArchT-BFP2 mixed with 0.5 &#x03BC;g pHuji-P2A-GJA1 (or the R202H or R76H mutant version). The medium was replaced 10 h later, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h prior to imaging.</p>

<title>pH calibration in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the mTagBFP-pHluorinCAAX and ArchT-P2A-mRuby3 plasmids (each at 0.5 &#x03BC;g per well in a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:3) or mTagBFP-pHluorinCAAX alone (1 &#x03BC;g per well) 24 h prior to imaging. Cover slips with cells attached were immersed in Tyrode&#x2019;s solution containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4) and then pre-treated with 10 &#x03BC;M Nigericin for 5 min, after which the calibration buffers were perfused into the chamber. After Nigericin was added, GFP and BFP channels were recorded simultaneously at 5-s intervals (500 ms/frame, 512&#x00D7;512 pixels) using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. Calibration buffers (containing 10 &#x03BC;M Nigericin) at pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, and 9.5 contained (in mM) 120 KCl, 30 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Glucose, and 10 HEPES; for pH 5.5 and 6.5 buffers, HEPES was replaced with 10 mM MES.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Patch-clamp recordings were performed using an Olympus IX81 upright microscope equipped with a 40x/0.95 NA objective; images were acquired using Micro-Manager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://micro-manager.org/">https://micro-manager.org/</ext-link>). Laser light was delivered via a Sutter DG-4 equipped with a xenon lamp. Cultured HEK293T cells were bathed in Tyrode&#x2019;s solution. Actuator HEK293T cells were identified by blue fluorescence (excitation filter: 350/50 nm; emission filter: 448/60 nm). ArchT was activated using the same light source filtered through a 560/25-nm Sutter VF5 filter. Light intensity was adjusted using the Sutter DG-4 and was calculated by measuring the light power transmitted through the objective using a SANWA laser power meter LP1). Recording electrodes (with a tip resistance of 3-6 M&#x03A9; when filled with internal solution) were fabricated using a Sutter P-97 electrode puller and controlled using Sutter MP-225 micromanipulators. The recording electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 Mg-ATP, 0.25 Na-GTP, 10 HEPES, and 0.4 EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH; osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose); where indicated, 100 &#x03BC;M carbenoxolone (CBX) (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied by perfusion. The recording signal was amplified and digitized using a HEKA EPC10 double patch-clamp amplifier and collected using Patch Master. Currents were smoothed using a 20-ms moving average in order to minimize 50 Hz AC noise. For simultaneous optical and electrophysiology recordings, the Sutter DG-4 light source was triggered by the HEKA EPC10 amplifier in order to synchronize the electrophysiological recording with the light simulation. All recordings were performed at room temperature.</p>

<title>FRAP measurements in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>A 1 mM stock solution of Calcein-AM was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 &#x03BC;M. The cells were then incubated for 10 min before washing 3 times with 1 ml Tyrode&#x2019;s solution. The coverslips containing the attached cells were then placed in a chamber containing Tyrode&#x2019;s solution and imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. A typical FRAP experiment was performed using 488 nm imaging for measuring the baseline (1 sec/frame, 5-sec interval, 5 frames, 512&#x00D7;512 pixels), 405 nm bleaching (12 sec, ROI &#x007E;5 &#x03BC;m in diameter within the cell), and 488 nm imaging for 2 min in order to track Calcein recovery.</p>

<title>Preparation, culture, transfection, and infection of primary cardiomyocytes</title>
<p>Cardiomyocytes (CMs) were enzymatically dissociated from the ventricles of neonatal (P0) Sprague-Dawley rats, and 0.5-1&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> CMs per well were seeded on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 24-well plates and grown in DMEM containing 10&#x0025; FBS and 1&#x0025; penicillin-streptomycin (all from Gibco) at 37&#x00B0;C in humidified air containing 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. Forty-eight hours after plating, CMs were simultaneously transfected with the ArchT-BFP2 plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) and infected with an adenovirus carrying pHluorinCAAX under CMV promoter (Vigene Biosciences). In brief, before transfection/infection, the medium in each well was replaced with 500 &#x03BC;l Opti-MEM. DNA (1 &#x03BC;g) and Lipofectamine 3000 (1.5 &#x03BC;l) were diluted in 100 &#x03BC;l Opti-MEM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before additional to each well. At the same time, 1 &#x03BC;l of adeno-associated virus carrying the pHluorinCAAX (3&#x00D7;10<sup>10</sup> pfu/ml) was added into the same wells. Eight hours later, the Opti-MEM was replaced with standard DMEM medium, and the CMs were incubated for an additional 24 h prior to imaging.</p>

<title>Measurements of beating rate and Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> transients in CMs</title>
<p>CMs were transfected with ArchT-BFP2 plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 as described above; 24 h after transfection, CMs expressing ArchT-BFP2 were loaded with 1 &#x03BC;M Fluo-8 AM (AAT Bioquest) for 20 min, washed with 1 ml Tyrode&#x2019;s solution for three times. CMs were imaged with 488 nm excitation in Tyrode&#x2019;s solution at room temperature using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope for 1 min to record Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> transients, followed by stimulation with 561 nm for 20 sec (5 trials at 2 min intervals). After stimulation, another 1 min of time-lapse imaging was performed using 488 nm excitation to record Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> transients. Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> transients recorded before and after light stimulation were counted using ImageJ analysis of the green channel. All images were generated at a rate of 100 ms/frame. Beating rate was measured using ImageJ analysis of the white-field images.</p>

<title>Ex vivo fly brain preparations for PARIS imaging</title>
<p>The entire brain from adult flies within 2 weeks after eclosion was dissected using fine forceps into Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-free adult-like hemolymph (ALH) containing (in mM): 108 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 HEPES, 5 trehalose, 5 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1-2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (275 mOsm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). The brain was then transferred to a glass-bottom chamber containing ALH for confocal imaging. The brain was held in place using a custom-made platinum frame and positioned with the anterior surface of the brain toward the objective (for imaging and stimulation of the antennal lobe), or with the posterior surface toward the objective (for imaging and stimulation of the lateral horn).</p>

<title>Fluorescence imaging and light stimulation</title>
<p>Imaging and light stimulation were performed using an inverted Nikon A1 confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon sapphire laser and either a 40x/1.35 NA oil objective (for HEK293T and HeLa cells) or a 20x/0.75 NA air objective (for CMs and fly brains). During imaging, the cells (HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, or CMs) were immersed in Tyrode&#x2019;s solution. Cells expressing the actuator (ArchT-BFP2) or receiver (pHluorinCAAX) were identified by the presence of blue or green fluorescence respectively. ArchT-BFP2 was excited at 405 nm and visualized using a 450/50-nm filter; pHluorin was excited at 488 nm and visualized using a GaSP photomultiplier after passing through a 525/50-nm filter. Blue fluorescent cells in adjacent to green cells were selected to conduct photostimulation with a ROI of 10-20 &#x03BC;m in diameter. ArchT was photostimulated using a 561 nm scanning laser at 0.5 mW for experiments using cell lines (except for the power-dependent measurements) and 0.1 mW for experiments using CMs. Typically, cells were first imaged using 488 nm excitation (256&#x00D7;256 pixels, 500 ms/frame, 2-5 sec intervals) to obtain a baseline fluorescence measurement. After obtaining a baseline, pulses of 561 nm laser light were applied to activate the ArchT (4 sec/pulse, 5-10 pulses with no delay), intertwined with 488 nm imaging of the receiver. The 488 nm imaging was continued (2-5 sec intervals) for 1-2 min after the 561-nm stimulation in order to record the fluorescence recovery of the receiver. For experiments using gap junction blockers and modulators, 100 &#x03BC;M CBX (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM heptanol (J&#x0026;K Scientific), 500 &#x03BC;M 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 &#x03BC;M forskolin (TargetMol), or 340 nM TPA (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied by adding a 1000x stock solution to the chamber. For CM experiments, heptanol was washed out of the chamber for 3 min by perfusion with Tyrode&#x2019;s solution.</p>
<p>Fly brains were stimulated and imaged in ALH using the same laser configuration described above. The antennal lobe (AL) and lateral horn (LH) were identified by the presence of pHluorin fluorescence and were stimulated with 0.5 mW laser intensity using an ROI 20-30 &#x03BC;m in diameter.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Time series images were analyzed using Nikon NIS and ImageJ with a batch-registration plugin (Nimmerjahn et al., 2009). A mean background value obtained from regions away from the pHluorin was subtracted in order to correct for fluorescence intensity (F). For each pixel, we calculated the normalized change in fluorescence intensity (&#x0394;F/F<sub>0</sub>), where F0 is the baseline fluorescence averaged from 5 frames obtained prior to light stimulation. &#x0394;F/F<sub>0</sub> over time was further processed using Origin 9.1 (OriginLab). &#x0394;F/F<sub>0</sub> images were processed with MATLAB (MathWorks) using custom-written scripts in order to produce pseudocolor images.</p>
