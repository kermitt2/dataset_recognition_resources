<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Influenza is notable for its evolutionary capacity to escape immunity targeting the viral hemagglutinin. We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the &#x2248; 10<sup>4</sup> amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the protein&#x2019;s structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinin&#x2019;s evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenza&#x2019;s antigenic evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epidemic influenza poses an annual threat to human health largely because the virus rapidly evolves to escape the immunity elicited by previous infections or vaccinations. The most potent form of anti-influenza immunity is antibodies targeting the virus&#x2019;s hemagglutinin (HA) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caton et al., 1982</xref>). The virus evades these antibodies primarily by accumulating amino-acid substitutions in HA&#x2019;s antigenic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, HA undergoes this rapid evolution while retaining the ability to fold to a highly conserved structure that performs two functions essential for viral replication: receptor binding and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wiley and Skehel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Russell et al., 2004</xref>). HA is therefore highly &#x201C;antigenically evolvable&#x201D; in the sense that it can accommodate rapid antigenic change without compromising its structural and functional properties.</p>
<p>Two factors that undoubtedly contribute to HA&#x2019;s rapid antigenic evolution are influenza&#x2019;s high mutation rate and the strong selection that immunity exerts on the virus. However, it is unclear whether these factors are sufficient to fully explain HA&#x2019;s antigenic evolution. For instance, while some other error-prone viruses (such as HIV and hepatitis C) also exhibit rapid antigenic evolution of their surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burton et al., 2012</xref>), other viruses with comparable mutation rates (such as measles) show little propensity for antigenic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duffy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sheshberadaran et al., 1983</xref>), despite the fact that evasion of immunity would presumably confer a selective benefit. A variety of explanations ranging in scale from ecological to molecular can be posited to account for these differences in rates of antigenic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lipsitch and O&#x2019;Hagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Koelle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heaton et al., 2013</xref>). One hypothesis is that HA has a high inherent tolerance for mutations in its antigenic sites, thereby conferring on influenza the evolutionary capacity to escape from anti-HA antibodies with relative ease.</p>
<p>Testing this hypothesis requires quantifying the inherent mutational tolerance of each site in HA. This cannot be done simply by examining variability among naturally occurring viruses, since the evolution of influenza in nature is shaped by a combination of inherent mutational tolerance and external immune selection. For example, the rapid evolution of HA&#x2019;s antigenic sites in nature could reflect the fact that these sites are especially tolerant of mutations, or it could be purely a consequence of strong immune selection. Traditional experimental approaches using site-directed mutagenesis or serial viral passage are also inadequate to quantify inherent mutational tolerance&#x2013;while such experimental techniques have been used to determine the effect of specific mutations on HA, they cannot feasibly be applied to all possible individual amino-acid mutations. Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heaton et al. (2013)</xref> used transposon mutagenesis to show that HA is tolerant to the random insertion of five to six amino-acid sequences at several locations in the protein. However, the relevance of this tolerance to insertional mutations is unclear, since HA&#x2019;s actual antigenic evolution involves almost entirely point substitutions, with only a very low rate of insertions and deletions.</p>
<p>Here we use the new high-throughput experimental technique of deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araya and Fowler, 2011</xref>) to comprehensively quantify the tolerance of HA to amino-acid mutations. Specifically, we create mutant libraries of the HA gene from the H1N1 strain A/WSN/1933 (WSN) that contain virtually all of the &#x2248; 4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>4</sup> possible individual codon mutations, and therefore virtually all of the &#x2248; 10<sup>4</sup> possible amino-acid mutations. We use these mutant libraries to generate pools of mutant influenza viruses, which we estimate incorporate at least 85&#x0025; of the possible HA codon mutations and 97&#x0025; of the possible amino-acid mutations. We then passage these viruses to select for functional variants, and use Illumina deep sequencing to determine the frequency of each HA mutation before and after this selection for viral growth. Since these experiments measure the impact of mutations in the absence of immune selection, they enable us to quantify HA&#x2019;s inherent tolerance for each amino acid at each site in the protein. We show that these quantitative measurements are consistent with existing knowledge about HA structure and function, and can be used to create an evolutionary model that describes HA&#x2019;s natural evolution far better than existing models of sequence evolution. Finally, we use our results to show that HA&#x2019;s antigenic sites are disproportionately tolerant of mutations, suggesting that a high inherent tolerance for mutations at key positions targeted by the immune system is one factor that contributes to influenza&#x2019;s antigenic evolvability.</p>

<title>Strategy for deep mutational scanning of HA</title>
<p>Our strategy for deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araya and Fowler, 2011</xref>) of HA is outlined in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The wildtype WSN HA gene was mutagenized to create a diverse library of mutant HA genes. This library of mutant genes was then used to generate a pool of mutant viruses by reverse genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). The mutant viruses were passaged at a low multiplicity of infection to ensure a linkage between genotype and phenotype. The frequencies of mutations before and after selection for viral growth were quantified by Illumina deep sequencing of the mutant genes (the <bold>mutDNA</bold> sample in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and the mutant viruses (the <bold>mutvirus</bold> sample in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). An identical process was performed in parallel using the unmutated wildtype HA gene to generate unmutated viruses in order to quantify the error rates associated with sequencing, reverse transcription, and virus growth (these are the <bold>DNA</bold> and <bold>virus</bold> samples in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The entire process in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> was performed in full biological triplicate (the replicates are referred to as &#x0023;1, &#x0023;2, and &#x0023;3). In addition, a repeat of the Illumina sample preparation and deep sequencing was performed for replicate &#x0023;1 to quantify the technical variation associated with these processes.</p>

<title>Creation of HA codon-mutant libraries</title>
<p>The deep mutational scanning strategy in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> requires the creation of mutant libraries of the HA gene. We wanted to assess the impact of all possible amino-acid mutations. Most mutagenesis techniques operate at the nucleotide level, and so frequently introduce single-nucleotide codon changes (e.g. <monospace>GGA &#x2192; cGA</monospace>) but only very rarely introduce multi-nucleotide codon changes (e.g. <monospace>GGA &#x2192; cat</monospace>). However, several PCR-based techniques have recently been developed to introduce random codon mutations into full-length genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Firnberg and Ostermeier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jain and Varadarajan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom, 2014</xref>). We used one of these techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom, 2014</xref>) to create three replicate codon-mutant libraries of the WSN HA gene (Supplementary file 1).</p>
<p>Sanger sequencing of 34 individual clones indicated that the libraries contained an average of slightly over two codon mutations per gene, with a very low rate of insertions and deletions (less than 0.1 per gene). The number of mutations per clone was distributed around this average in an approximately Poisson fashion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The mutations consisted of a mix of one-, two-, and three-nucleotide codon changes, and were roughly uniform in their nucleotide composition and location in the gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The genes in each mutant library were cloned at high efficiency into a bidirectional influenza reverse-genetics plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). Each of the library replicates contained at least six-million unique clones&#x2013;a diversity that far exceeds the 10<sup>4</sup> unique single amino-acid mutations and the &#x2248; 4&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> unique single codon mutations to the HA gene. The vast majority of possible codon and amino-acid mutations are therefore represented many times in each plasmid mutant library, both individually and in combination with other mutations.</p>

<title>Generation of mutant viruses by reverse genetics</title>
<p>The HA plasmid mutant libraries were used to generate pools of mutant influenza viruses by reverse genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). Briefly, this process involves transfecting cells with the HA plasmid mutant library along with plasmids encoding the other seven genes from the WSN strain of influenza. Although the cells were transfected with a very large diversity of HA plasmids, we were uncertain what fraction of the genes encoded on these plasmids would actually be productively packaged into a virus. In an attempt to maximize the diversity in the viral pools, the mutant viruses were generated by transfecting several dozen wells of cells. The logic behind this scheme was to maintain substantial diversity even if only a subset of viral mutants stochastically predominated in each individual well of cells. A different replicate virus pool was generated for each of the three HA plasmid mutant libraries.</p>
<p>The mutant viruses generated for each replicate were passaged at a relatively low multiplicity of infection (0.1) to reduce the probability of co-infection, thereby ensuring a link between viral genotype and phenotype. The passaging was performed in a total of 2.4&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> cells, thereby maintaining a diversity of over two-million infectious viral particles.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Deep sequencing reveals purifying selection against many mutations</title>
<p>We used Illumina sequencing to quantify the frequencies of mutations before and after selection for viral growth. For each replicate, we sequenced HA from the unmutated plasmid, the plasmid mutant library, virus produced from the unmutated plasmid, and mutant virus produced from the plasmid mutant library&#x2013;these are the <bold>DNA</bold>, <bold>mutDNA</bold>, <bold>virus</bold>, and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. For the <bold>DNA</bold> and <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples, the HA gene was amplified directly from the plasmids by PCR. For the <bold>virus</bold> and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples, the HA gene was first reverse-transcribed from viral RNA and was then amplified by PCR. In all cases, template quantification was performed prior to PCR to ensure that &#x003E; 10<sup>6</sup> initial HA molecules were used as templates for subsequent amplification.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the sequencing error rate, the HA molecules were sheared to roughly 50 nucleotide fragments and sequenced with overlapping paired-end reads (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref>). We only called codon identities for which both paired reads concur&#x2013;this strategy substantially increases the sequencing fidelity, since it is rare for the same sequencing error to occur in both reads. For each sample, we obtained in excess of 10<sup>7</sup> overlapping paired-end reads that could be aligned to HA (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the read depth varied somewhat along the primary sequence due to biases in the fragmentation, we obtained well over 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> unique paired reads for most codons (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the frequency of mutations in each sample as quantified by deep sequencing. The <bold>DNA</bold> samples derived from unmutated HA plasmid show a low frequency of apparent mutations which are almost exclusively composed of single-nucleotide codon changes&#x2013;the frequency of these apparent mutations reflects the rate of errors from the PCR amplification and subsequent deep sequencing. The <bold>virus</bold> samples created from the unmutated plasmid show only a slightly higher frequency of mutations, indicating that reverse-transcription and viral replication introduce only a small number of additional mutations. As expected, the <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples derived from the plasmid mutant libraries show a high rate of one-, two-, and three-nucleotide mutations, as all three types of mutations were introduced during the codon mutagenesis. The <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples derived from the mutant virus pools exhibit a mutation rate that is substantially lower than that of the <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples. Most of the reduction in mutation frequency in the <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples is due to decreased frequencies of nonsynonymous and stop-codon mutations; synonymous mutations are only slightly depressed in frequency. As stop-codon and nonsynonymous mutations are much more likely than synonymous mutations to substantially impair viral fitness, these results are consistent with purifying selection purging deleterious mutations during viral growth.</p>

<title>Most mutations are sampled by the experiments</title>
<p>It is important to assess the completeness with which the experiments sampled all possible HA mutations. It is possible to imagine several problems that could limit mutational sampling: mutations might be absent from the plasmid mutant libraries due to biases in the codon mutagenesis, mutations that are present in the plasmid mutants might fail to be incorporated into viruses due to stochastic bottlenecks during virus generation by reverse genetics, or the sequencing read depth might be inadequate to sample the mutations that are present. The most straightforward way to assess these issues is to quantify the number of times that each possible multi-nucleotide codon mutation is observed in the <bold>mutDNA</bold> and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples. Restricting the analysis to multi-nucleotide codon mutations avoids the confounding effects of sequencing and reverse-transcription errors, which cause almost exclusively single-nucleotide changes.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the number of times that each mutation was observed in the combined sequencing data for the three biological replicates; <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref> shows the same data for the replicates individually. More than 99.5&#x0025; of multi-nucleotide codon mutations are observed at least five times in the combined sequencing data from the plasmid mutant libraries (<bold>mutDNA</bold> samples), and &#x2248; 97.5&#x0025; of all such mutations are observed at least five times in sequencing of the <bold>mutDNA</bold> for each individual replicate. These results indicate that the vast majority of codon mutations are represented in the plasmid mutant libraries.</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 4:</label>
<caption><p>The number of times that each possible multi-nucleotide codon mutation was observed in each sample after combining the data for the three biological replicates. Nearly all mutations were observed many times in the <bold>mutDNA</bold> samples, indicating that the codon mutagenesis was comprehensive. Only about half of the mutations were observed at least five times in the <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples, indicating either a bottleneck during virus generation or purifying selection against many of the mutations. If the analysis is restricted to synonymous multi-nucleotide codon mutations, then about 85&#x0025; of mutations are observed at least five times in the <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples. Since synonymous mutations are less likely to be eliminated by purifying selection, this latter number provides a lower bound on the fraction of codon mutations that were sampled by the mutant viruses. The redundancy of the genetic code means that the fraction of amino-acid mutations sampled is higher. This plot is the file <italic>countparsedmuts_multi-nt-codonmutcounts.pdf</italic> described at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jbloom.github.io/mapmuts/example_WSN_HA_2014Analysis.html">http://jbloom.github.io/mapmuts/example_WSN_HA_2014Analysis.html</ext-link>. Similar plots for the individual replicates are shown in <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="005041_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In contrast, only 53&#x0025; of multi-nucleotide codon mutations are observed at least five times in the combined sequencing data for the mutant viruses (<bold>mutvirus</bold> samples), and only &#x2248; 26&#x0025; of such mutations are observed at least five times in sequencing of the <bold>mutvirus</bold> for each individual replicate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these numbers are confounded by the fact that many mutations are deleterious, and so may be absent because purifying selection has purged them from the mutant viruses. A less confounded measure is the frequency of <italic>synonymous</italic> multi-nucleotide mutations, since synonymous mutations are less likely to be strongly deleterious. About 85&#x0025; of such mutations are observed at least five times in the combined <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples, and &#x2248; 51&#x0025; of such mutations are observed at least five times in the <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples for the individual replicates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref>). Note that these numbers are only a lower bound on the fraction of codon mutations sampled by the mutant viruses&#x2013;even synonymous mutations to influenza are sometimes strongly deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marsh et al., 2008</xref>), and so some of the missing synonymous codon mutations may have been introduced into mutant viruses but then purged by purifying selection. Furthermore, the redundancy of the genetic code means that the fraction of possible amino-acid mutations sampled is substantially higher than the fraction of codon mutations sampled. Specifically, if 85&#x0025; of possible codon mutations are sampled at least five times in the combined libraries (as <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> indicates), then our simulations suggest that &#x2248; 97&#x0025; of possible amino-acid mutations will have also been sampled at least five times (see Methods).</p>
<p>Overall, these results indicate that nearly all mutations are represented in the plasmid mutant libraries. Virus generation by reverse genetics does introduce a bottleneck&#x2013;but fortunately, this bottleneck is sufficiently mild that at least half of all possible codon mutations are still sampled at least five times by the mutant viruses in each individual replicate. Combining the data for the three replicates brings the coverage of possible codon mutations to around 85&#x0025;, and the coverage of possible amino-acid mutations to 97&#x0025;. Therefore, the sampling of mutations is sufficiently complete to provide information on the effects of most amino-acid mutations when the data from the three experimental replicates are combined.</p>

<title>Estimation of the effects of each amino-acid mutation to HA</title>
<p>We quantified the effects of mutations in terms of site-specific amino-acid &#x201C;preferences.&#x201D; These preferences are the expected frequency of each amino acid at each site in the mutant viruses in a hypothetical situation in which all amino acids are introduced at that site at equal frequency in the initial plasmid mutant library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom, 2014</xref>). Because many of the HAs in our libraries contain several mutations, these preferences do not simply correspond to the fitness effect of each individual mutation to the WSN HA&#x2013;rather, they represent the average effect of each mutation in a collection of closely related HA mutants. Mutations to amino acids with high preferences are favored by selection, while mutations to amino acids with low preferences are disfavored. The amino-acid preferences are inferred from the deep sequencing data using a Bayesian statistical framework in which the observed counts are treated as draws from multinomial distributions with unknown parameters representing the initial mutagenesis rate, the various error rates, and selection as represented by the preferences (see Methods for details).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the amino-acid preferences for the entire HA gene inferred from the combined data from all three biological replicates. As can be seen from this figure, some sites have strong preferences for one specific amino acid, while other sites are tolerant of a variety of different amino acids. As described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the inferred amino-acid preferences are consistent with existing knowledge about mutations and residues affecting HA stability, membrane fusion, proteolytic activation, and receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakajima et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Qiao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stech et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martin et al., 1998</xref>).

<p>Despite the general concordance between the inferred amino-acid preferences and existing knowledge, it is important to quantify the experimental error associated with the deep mutational scanning. We sought to quantify two factors: <italic>technical</italic> variation due to inaccuracies and statistical limitations during Illumina sample preparation and deep sequencing, and <italic>biological</italic> variation due to stochasticity in the viral mutants that were generated and enriched during each replicate of the experiment. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> shows the correlation between biological replicate &#x0023;1 and a technical repeat of the Illumina sample preparation and deep sequencing for this biological replicate. There is a very high correlation between the preferences inferred from these two repeats, indicating that technical variation has only a very minor influence on the final inferred amino-acid preferences. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-D</xref> show the correlation among the three different biological replicates. Although the biological replicates are substantially correlated, there is also clear variation. Most of this variation is attributable to amino acids which in one replicate are inferred to have preferences near the <italic>a priori</italic> expectation of 0.05 (there are 20 amino acids, which in the absence of data are all initially assumed to have an equal preference of <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="005041_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), but in another replicate are inferred to have a much higher or lower preference. Such variation arises because the mutant viruses for each biological replicate only sample about 50&#x0025; of the possible codon mutations (see previous section), meaning that there is little data for some mutations in any given replicate. Fortunately, combining the three biological replicates greatly increases the coverage of possible mutations (see previous section). Therefore, inferences made from the combined data (as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) should be substantially more accurate than inferences from any of the individual replicates. This idea is supported by the results of the next section, which quantifies the extent to which the inferred preferences accurately describe natural HA evolution.</p>

<p>Do the results of the deep mutational scanning experiment accurately reflect the real constraints on HA? The comparison in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> uses an anecdotal comparison to a small number of existing experimental studies to suggest that they do.

<p>To make such a comparison, we created an alignment of HA sequences from human and swine influenza viruses descended from a common ancestor closely related to the virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> shows a phylogenetic tree of these sequences.

<p>The crudest comparison is simply to correlate amino-acid frequencies in the natural sequences to the experimentally inferred amino-acid preferences. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> shows that the inferred preferences are substantially although imperfectly correlated with the natural amino-acid frequencies. However, this comparison is imperfect because it fails to account for the contingent and limited sampling of mutations by natural evolution. While the deep mutational scanning is designed to sample all possible mutations, only a fraction of theoretically tolerable mutations have fixed in natural H1 HAs due to the finite timespan during which evolution has been exploring possible sequences (in other words, evolution is not at &#x201C;equilibrium&#x201D;). Therefore, an amino-acid frequency of close to one among the natural HA sequences in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> might imply an absolute functional requirement for that amino acid&#x2013;or it might simply mean that natural evolution has not yet happened to fix a mutation to another tolerable amino acid at that site.</p>

<p>A better approach is therefore to treat natural evolution as a non-equilibrium dynamic process, and ask whether the inferred amino-acid preferences accurately describe this process. This type of analysis can be done using the likelihood-based statistical framework for phylogenetics developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Felsenstein (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">1981</xref>). Specifically, we fix the phylogenetic tree topology to that shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and then assess the likelihood of the natural sequences given a specific evolutionary model after optimizing the branch lengths of the tree. Evolutionary models that more accurately describe HA sequence evolution will have higher likelihoods, and the relative accuracy of models can be quantified by comparing their likelihoods after correcting for the number of free parameters using AIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Posada and Buckley, 2004</xref>).

The model based on amino-acid preferences inferred from the combined experimental data from the three replicates describes the evolution of the naturally occurring HA sequences far better than the alternative models, despite the fact that the latter have a variety of free parameters that are optimized to improve the fit. Models based on amino-acid preferences inferred from the individual experimental replicates also fit the data better than existing models&#x2013;however, the fit is poorer than for the model that utilizes the data from all three replicates. This result is consistent with the fact that the individual replicates are incomplete in their sampling of the mutational effects, meaning that aggregating the data from several replicates improves the accuracy of inferred preferences. Overall, these comparisons show that the deep mutational scanning reflects the actual constraints on HA evolution substantially better than existing quantitative evolutionary models.</p>

<title>The inherent evolvability of antigenic sites on HA</title>
<p>The amino-acid preferences inferred from the deep mutational scanning reflect the inherent mutational tolerance of sites in HA. In contrast, the evolution of HA in nature is shaped by a combination of HA&#x2019;s inherent mutational tolerance and external selection pressures. Specifically, the evolution of HA in humans is strongly driven by selection for mutations that alter antigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yewdell et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caton et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Koel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that such antigenic mutations fix at high frequency implies some degree of mutational tolerance at antigenic sites, since no mutations would fix if these sites were under absolute structural or functional constraint. However, it is not possible to tell from analysis of natural sequences alone whether antigenic sites are unusually mutationally tolerant compared to the rest of HA, or whether their rapid evolution is solely due to the fact that they are under strong external immune selection.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we used the results of the deep mutational scanning to compare the inherent mutational tolerance of antigenic sites to the rest of the HA protein. We classified HA1 (the head domain) into antigenic sites and all other residues, using the antigenic site definitions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> with additional exclusion of a single site that has gained glycosylation in the WSN HA (see Methods). We also performed a similar classification of HA1 into conserved receptor-binding residues and all other residues. These conserved receptor-binding residues represent a control group for our comparison&#x2013;while we hypothesize that antigenic sites might be inherently more mutationally tolerant than the rest of HA, we strongly expect that receptor-binding residues will be less mutationally tolerant than the rest of HA. The positions of the antigenic sites and conserved receptor-binding residues in the primary sequence are indicated by the top overlay bar in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Visual inspection of this figure suggests that the receptor-binding residues are indeed relatively intolerant of mutations (have a strong preference for one specific amino acid), whereas the antigenic sites are relatively tolerant of mutations (have roughly equivalent preferences for many amino acids).</p>
<p>To quantify mutational tolerance, we computed a site entropy from the inferred amino-acid preferences&#x2013;larger site entropies indicate a higher inherent tolerance for mutations. The site entropies for the antigenic sites and receptor-binding residues are displayed on the HA protein structure in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>. Inspection of this figure reveals that antigenic sites have high site entropies, whereas receptor-binding residues have low site entropies. However, it is well known that sites with higher relative solvent accessibility are typically more mutationally tolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ramsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bustamante et al., 2000</xref>), so it is necessary to correct for this effect. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B,C</xref> plot site entropy as a function of relative solvent accessibility for all HA1 sites in the crystal structure. These plots suggest that receptor-binding residues are less mutationally tolerant and antigenic sites are more mutationally tolerant than other comparable residues, even after correcting for relative solvent accessibility. This finding is validated at a high level of statistical significance by multiple linear regression (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, we can conclude that the antigenic sites in HA have unusually high mutational tolerance, suggesting that this property combines with external immune selection to contribute to HA&#x2019;s rapid antigenic evolution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A fundamental challenge in studying the natural evolution of influenza is separating the effects of external selection pressures from inherent structural and functional constraints. The evolutionary patterns observed in natural sequences are shaped by a combination of inherent mutational tolerance and external pressures such as immune selection, and the analysis of such sequences is further confounded by the fact that influenza is not at evolutionary equilibrium.</p>
<p>Here we have quantified the inherent mutational tolerance of influenza HA by using deep mutational scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Araya and Fowler, 2011</xref>) to simultaneously assess the impact on viral growth of the vast majority of the &#x2248; 10<sup>4</sup> possible amino-acid mutations to influenza HA. The information obtained from the deep mutational scanning is consistent with existing knowledge about the effects of mutations on HA function and structure. For instance, the deep mutational scanning shows strong selection for specific amino acids known to play important roles in HA&#x2019;s receptor-binding activity, fusion activity, and proteolytic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Qiao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stech et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martin et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, at the sites of known temperature-sensitive mutations to HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakajima et al., 1986</xref>), the deep mutational scanning identifies the more stabilizing amino-acid as more favorable. Broader trends from the deep mutational scanning are also in agreement with current thinking about mutational effects. For example, the deep mutational scanning finds that there is strong purifying selection against stop-codon mutations and many nonsynonymous mutations, but that there is only weak selection against synonymous mutations. All of these results suggest that the deep mutational scanning faithfully captures both the specific and general effects of mutations on HA.</p>
<p>The comprehensive information generated by the deep mutational scanning can be used to create quantitative evolutionary models for analyzing HA sequence phylogenies. Here we have shown that an evolutionary model constructed from our deep mutational scanning data describes the evolution of human and swine H1 HAs far better than existing state-of-the-art models for sequence evolution. We anticipate that separating HA&#x2019;s inherent mutational tolerance from external selection should also eventually allow the external selection pressures to be studied in greater detail. For example, one might imagine that sites in HA that exhibit evolutionary patterns that deviate from the quantitative model created from our deep mutational scanning are likely to be under external selection. Future work that augments deep mutational scanning with specific experimentally defined selection pressures (such as antibodies against HA) could aid in further elucidation of the forces that shape influenza evolution.</p>
<p>The deep mutational scanning also enabled us to assess the extent to which HA&#x2019;s inherent mutational tolerance contributes to influenza&#x2019;s antigenic evolvability. It remains a mystery why error-prone RNA viruses differ so widely in their capacity for evolutionary escape from immunity, with some (e.g. influenza and HIV) undergoing rapid antigenic evolution while others (e.g. measles) show little antigenic change on relevant timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lipsitch and O&#x2019;Hagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Koelle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heaton et al., 2013</xref>). Our data demonstrate that the antigenic sites in HA are unusually tolerant to mutations, implying that inherent evolutionary plasticity at sites targeted by the immune system is one factor that contributes to influenza&#x2019;s rapid antigenic evolution. This high mutational tolerance at antigenic sites could itself be a property that influenza has evolved to aid in its antigenic escape&#x2013;or it might simply be an unfortunate coincidence that the immune system focuses on especially plastic portions of HA. In either case, it is intriguing to speculate whether a high inherent mutational tolerance in antigenic sites is also a feature of other antigenically variable RNA viruses. Application of the deep mutational scanning approach used here to additional viruses should provide a means to address this question.</p>

<title>Generation of HA codon mutation library</title>

This reduction in the number of rounds of mutagenesis reduced the average number of codon mutations from the &#x2248; three per clone in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref> to the &#x2248; two per clone shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.

The BsmBI-digested HA was ligated into a dephosphorylated (Antarctic Phosphatase, New England Biolabs, M0289L) and BsmBI-digested preparation of the bidirectional reverse-genetics plasmid pHW2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>) using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, M0202S). Column-purified ligations were electroporated into ElectroMAX DH10B T1 phage-resistant competent cells (Invitrogen, 12033-015) and plated on LB plates containing 100 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g/ml of ampicilin. A 1:4000 dilution of each transformation was plated in parallel to enable estimation of the number of unique transformants&#x2013;we obtained at least two-million unique colonies per transformation. For each replicate of the codon-mutant library, we performed three transformations to generate approximately six-million independent clones per replicate library. Control ligations lacking an insert yielded at least 100 times fewer colonies, indicating a very low rate of background self-ligation of the pHW2000 plasmid. The transformants from each HA mutant library replicate were pooled, cultured in LB supplemented with ampicillin, and mini-prepped to generate the HA codon mutant plasmid libraries.</p>
<p>For the Sanger sequencing analysis shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, we picked and prepped 34 independent colonies for sequencing.

<title>Virus rescue and passage in cells</title>
<p>The HA mutant plasmid libraries were used to generate pools of mutant influenza viruses by reverse genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). Cocultures of 293T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transfected with equal amounts of HA (either unmutated or one of the plasmid mutant libraries) cloned into pHW2000 as described above, plus the seven other WSN genes in bidirectional reverse-genetics plasmids (pHW181-PB2, pHW182-PB1, pHW183-PA, pHW185-NP, pHW186-NA, pHW187-NA, pHW188-NS), which were kind gifts from Robert Webster of St. Jude Children&#x2019;s Research Hospital. Overall, six viral rescues and passages were performed, each using a different HA plasmid preparation: the three HA mutant library replicates (eventually yielding the <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and three independent unmutated HAs (eventually yielding the <bold>virus</bold> samples in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Each of the viral rescues was performed by transfecting multiple wells of cells in an effort to increase the diversity of the rescued viruses. Specifically, two 12-well dishes were transfected per rescue. Cells were plated at 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> 293T cells and 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>4</sup> MDCK-SIAT1 cells per well in D10 (DMEM supplemented with 10&#x0025; heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g of streptomycin/ml), and then each well was transfected with 1 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g of total plasmid DNA (125 ng of each of the eight plasmids) using the BioT transfection reagent (Bioland B01-02). At 12 to 18 hours post-transfection, the medium was changed to our <italic>WSN viral growth media</italic>: Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.5&#x0025; heat-inactivated FBS, 0.3&#x0025; BSA, 100 U of penicillin/ml, 100 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g of streptomycin/ml, and 100 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>g of calcium chloride/ml. This media does not contain trypsin since viruses with the WSN HA and NA are trypsin independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goto and Kawaoka, 1998</xref>). Viral supernatants were collected 72 hours post-transfection, and the supernatants from the different wells were pooled for each viral rescue. These pooled supernatants were then clarified by centrifugation at 2000&#x00D7;g for five minutes, aliquoted, and frozen at &#x2212;80<italic><sup>o</sup></italic>C. Aliquots were then thawed and titered by TCID50 (see below).</p>
<p>For viral passage, each viral rescue replicate was passaged in four 10-cm dishes. Briefly, 6 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> MDCK-SIAT1 cells per 10-cm dish in <italic>WSN viral growth media</italic> were infected with 6 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> infectious particles (multiplicity of infection of 0.1). Since there are four dishes for each replicate, this maintains a diversity of 2.4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> TCID50 units per replicate. The passaged viral supernatants were collected at 50 hours post-infection, and the supernatants for the four plates were pooled for each replicate. These pooled supernatants were clarified at 2000&#x00D7;g for five minutes, aliquoted, and frozen at -80<italic><sup>o</sup></italic>C. Aliquots were then thawed and titered by TCID50.</p>

<title>Virus titering by TCID50</title>
<p>The viruses were titered by TCID50 (50&#x0025; tissue culture infectious dose). In this assay, 10 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>l of a 1:10 dilution of the viral supernatant to be titered was added to the first row of a 96-well tissue culture plate containing 90 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>l of <italic>WSN viral growth media</italic>. At least one no-virus control supernatant was included on each plate as a negative control.

<title>Generation of samples for Illumina deep sequencing</title>
<p>The deep sequencing samples were prepared from PCR amplicons that were generated exactly as described for the <bold>DNA</bold>, <bold>mutDNA</bold>, <bold>virus</bold>, and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>. The viral RNA template for the <bold>virus</bold> and <bold>mutvirus</bold> were isolated using freshly purchased Trizol reagent (Life Technologies; 15596-026) in order to avoid any oxidative damage associated with old reagents. After performing reverse transcription as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify the number of HA cDNA molecules to ensure that there were at least 10<sup>6</sup> unique template molecules before beginning the subsequent PCR amplification. The qPCR primers were designed based on those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marsh et al. (2007)</xref>, and were 5&#x2019;-taacctgctcgaagacagcc-3&#x2019; and 5&#x2019;-agagccatccggtgatgtta-3&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The PCR amplicons were fragmented and barcoded using the custom modification of Illumina&#x2019;s Nextera kit using the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>. Samples were barcoded as follows: <bold>DNA</bold> - N701, <bold>mutDNA</bold> - N702, <bold>virus</bold> - N704, and <bold>mutvirus</bold> - N705. For each of the three biological replicates, these four samples were pooled and sequenced on their own Illumina lane with 50-nucleotide paired-end reads as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>. For the technical sequencing repeat of biological replicate &#x0023;1, the library preparation and sequencing were repeated from the same viral RNA templates. This technical repeat therefore only quantifies variation associated with sample preparation and sequencing, whereas the biological replicates also quantify variation associated with the processes of codon-mutant library creation, virus generation, and virus passage.</p>

<title>Analysis of deep sequencing data</title>
<p>The deep sequencing data was analyzed using the <italic>mapmuts</italic> computer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom, 2014</xref>). A description of the analysis approach and the resulting data files and figures produced are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jbloom.github.io/mapmuts/example_WSN_HA_2014Analysis.html">http://jbloom.github.io/mapmuts/example_WSN_HA_2014Analysis.html</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Briefly, paired reads were overlapped as illustrated in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref> and then aligned to HA. Reads were retained only if both reads in the pair passed the default Illumina filter, had average Q-scores of at least 25, overlapped for at least 30 nucleotides with no more than one mismatch, and the overlap aligned to the HA gene with no more than six mismatches. <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3&#x2013;figure supplement 2</xref> shows the number of reads for each sample that met these criteria. Most reads that did not meet these criteria failed to do so because they could not be paired with at least 30 nucleotides of overlap&#x2013;a situation that arises when the HA fragment produced by the Nextera fragmentation produces a fragment smaller than 30 nucleotides or larger than 70 nucleotides. Codon identities were called only if both overlapped paired reads agreed on the identity of the codon. This requirement reduces the error rate, because it is rare for both paired reads to independently experience the same sequencing error.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, we estimated that 85&#x0025; of possible codon mutations were sampled at least five times by the mutant viruses. To estimate the fraction of amino-acid mutations that would have been sampled, we simulated randomly selecting 85&#x0025; of the mutant codons from the HA sequence, and determined that these codons encoded &#x2248; 97&#x0025; of the amino-acid mutations.</p>

<title>Inference of amino-acid preferences and site entropies</title>
<p>The counts of each codon identity in the deep sequencing data was used to infer the &#x201C;preference&#x201D; of each site for each amino acid as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>. This inference was also done using the <italic>mapmuts</italic> computer program as detailed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jbloom.github.io/mapmuts/example_WSN_HA_2014Analysis.html">http://jbloom.github.io/mapmuts/example_WSN_HA_2014Analysis.html</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Briefly, the preference <italic>&#x03C0;</italic><sub><italic>r,a</italic></sub> of site <italic>r</italic> for amino-acid <italic>a</italic> represents the expected frequency of that amino acid in a hypothetical library where each amino-acid is introduced at equal frequency.

<alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="005041_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>&#x025B;<sub>r,x</sub></italic> is the rate at which site <italic>r</italic> is erroneously read to be codon <italic>x</italic>, <italic>&#x03C1;<sub>r,x</sub></italic> is the rate at which site <italic>r</italic> is erroneously reverse-transcribed to codon <italic>x</italic>, and <italic>&#x00B5;<sub>r,x</sub></italic> is the rate at which site <italic>r</italic> is mutagenized to codon <italic>x</italic> in the mutant DNA sample. These unknown error and mutation rate parameters are inferred from the <bold>DNA</bold>, <bold>virus</bold>, and <bold>mutvirus</bold> samples using the Bayesian approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>. Inferences of the posterior mean preferences <italic>&#x03C0;<sub>r,a</sub></italic> were made separately for each replicate of the experiment, and the correlations among these inferences from different replicates are in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The final &#x201C;best&#x201D; inferred preferences from the combined data of the three biological replicates were obtained by averaging the preferences obtained from the three biological replicates. These final inferred preferences are provided in Supplementary file 3 and displayed graphically in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>.</p>
<p>The site entropies in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> were calculated from the amino-acid preferences as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="005041_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.

<title>Alignment of naturally occurring HAs and phylogenetic tree</title>
<p>The inferred amino-acid preferences were compared to amino-acid frequencies in an alignment of naturally occurring H1N1 HAs from swine and human lineages descended from a close relative of the 1918 virus. Briefly, all full-length H1 HAs from these hosts were downloaded from the Influenza Virus Resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bao et al., 2008</xref>). Up to three sequences per host and year were randomly subsampled and used to build a phylogenetic tree. Clear outliers from the molecular clock (typically lab artifacts or mis-annotated sequences) were iteratively excluded and the trees were rebuilt. The final sequence alignment is in Supplementary file 4. This alignment was used to build the phylogenetic trees in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure 7&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref> with <italic>codonPhyML</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gil et al., 2013</xref>) using the codon-substitution model of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Goldman and Yang, 1994</xref>) or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kosiol et al., 2007</xref>) with empirical codon frequencies determined using the CF3&#x00D7;4 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pond et al., 2010</xref>) or the <italic>F</italic> method, respectively.

<title>Comparison of evolutionary models</title>
<p>We compared the accuracy with which the naturally occurring HA phylogeny was described by an evolutionary model based on the experimentally measured amino-acid preferences versus several standard codon-substitution models.

<p>Briefly, the phylogenetic tree topology was fixed to that shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> or <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure 7&#x2013;figure supplement 1</xref>. The branch lengths and any free parameters of the evolutionary model were then optimized by maximum likelihood. The experimentally determined evolutionary models were constructed from the inferred amino-acid preferences reported here and the experimentally measured mutation rates reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref>. The &#x201C;fixation probabilities&#x201D; were computed using either the Metropolis-like relationship described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bloom (2014)</xref> or the relationship proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Halpern and Bruno (1998)</xref>. The results of these comparisons are in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table 2&#x2013;table supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table 2&#x2013;table supplement 2</xref>, and <xref rid="tblS3" ref-type="table">Table 2&#x2013;table supplement 3</xref>.

<title>Classification of antigenic sites and conserved receptor-binding residues</title>
<p>Two sub-classifications of HA residues were performed. Conserved receptor-binding sites were any residues listed in the first table of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Martin et al. (1998)</xref> that are also conserved in at least 90&#x0025; of H1 HAs. These residues are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Antigenic-site residues are classified based on antigenic mapping of the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) HA. Specifically, these are any residues listed in the third table of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caton et al. (1982)</xref> with the following exceptions: residue 182 (H3 numbering) is not considered for the reason explained on page 421 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caton et al. (1982)</xref>, residue 273 (H3 numbering) is not considered for the reason explained on page 422 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caton et al. (1982)</xref>, and residue 129 (H3 numbering) is not considered because it has gained a glycosylation site in the WSN HA that is not present in the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) HA and mutation of this WSN glycosylation site can strongly affect viral growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deom et al., 1986</xref>). Overall, this gives the following set of antigenic residues, listed by sequential numbering of the HA with the H3 number in parentheses: 171 (158), 173 (160), 175 (162), 176 (163), 178 (165), 179 (166), 180 (167), 169 (156), 172 (159), 205 (192), 206 (193), 209 (196), 211 (198), 182 (169), 186 (173), 220 (207), 253 (240), 153 (140), 156 (143), 158 (145), 237 (224), 238 (225), 87 (78), 88 (79), 90 (81), 91 (82), 92 (83), and 135 (122).</p>
