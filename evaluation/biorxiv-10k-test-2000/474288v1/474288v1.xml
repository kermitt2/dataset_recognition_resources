<title>Summary</title>
<p>Beige fat dissipates energy and functions as a defense against cold and obesity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that the signaling of interleukin (IL)-25 including its cognate receptor, IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), increased in adipose tissue upon cold and &#x03B2;3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. IL-25 induced the browning effect in white adipose tissue (WAT) by releasing IL-4, 13 and promoting alternative activation of macrophages to regulate innervation, which characterized as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) up-regulation to produce more catecholamine including norepinephrine. Blockade of IL-4R&#x03B1; and depletion of macrophages with clodronate-loaded liposomes in vivo significantly impaired the browning of WAT. Obese mice administered with IL-25 were protected from obesity on a high-fat diet and the subsequent metabolic disorders, and the process involved the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. In conclusion, the activation of IL-25 signaling on beige fat might play a therapeutic potential for obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity, which affects approximately 13&#x0025; adults worldwide, has become a major and pressing global problem. Obesity increases the risk of various metabolic disorders such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. As the high energy-density diet and the sedentary lifestyle cause obesity, interventions have been focused on pathways involving a decrease in energy intake and/or an increase in energy expenditure. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) in neck and interscapular region produces heat and is important for small mammals housed in cold environment. Activation of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive adipocytes would release heat via uncoupled oxidation respiratory chain for ATP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Therefore, brown adipocytes could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity, although the thermogenic tissue is almost lacking in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Besides the classical brown fat, the other thermogenic tissue named beige fat tissue could also be a potential target for treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Although both of the two adipocytes are similar in high expression of UCP1, beige adipocyte differs from classical brown adipocyte in the following characteristics. First, from the perspective of evolution, brown adipocyte derives from a myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) and paired box 7 (Pax7)-positive precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], but beige adipocyte precursors from a Myf5-negative, platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfr-&#x03B1;)-positive cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Second, beige adipocytes with the browning genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> inducible activated by cold and &#x03B2;-agonist stimulation are mainly located in the subcutaneous and epididymal depot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], while brown adipocytes are located mainly in neck and interscapular region and express high levels of UCP1. Third, the development of brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes was regulated by different pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Hence, brown and beige adipocyte are considered as two distinct cell types, whereas the beige adipose tissue innervation depot shares a coincident shift in the gene expression profile of neurons in stellate ganglion projecting to the brown adipose tissue depot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Adipose tissue is an endocrine and immune organ including different kinds of immune cells such as macrophages, eosinophils, T cells, and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and therefore characterizes as a typical circumstance tying organismal metabolism to cellular metabolism and immunity. Crosstalk among adipocytes, recruited immune cells and released cytokines play a key role in maintaining the whole homeostasis. Emerging evidence shows that the immune environment also influences the modulation of adipose tissue, especially in the biogenesis of beige adipocytes. For example, eosinophils and alternatively activated macrophages in adipose tissue are crucial for the cold-exposure-induced browning of WAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In addition, mast cells may also influence the development of beige fat by sensing cold environment and subsequently release histamine to promote UCP1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Therefore, although underlying mechanisms are not fully understand, the diversity of endocrines and cytokines may play a key role in the modulation of adipose tissue, and the immune cells may stimulate the biogenesis of beige fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Previously we found that nematode infection stimulated type 2 immunity by releasing macrophage-responsive Th2 interleukins (ILs) including IL-25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and modulated body weight against obesity and associated metabolic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. To further explore whether the process above is related to thermogenesis or not, we hereby investigated the role of IL-25 in modulating the browning effect of adipose tissue.</p>
<p>IL-25 is a member of IL-17 cytokine family (also called IL-17E) present in various tissues. The receptor of IL-25, IL-17RB, is expressed in various cell types, such as epithelial cells, eosinophils and NKT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In addition to its role in mucosal or type 2 immunity, IL-25 has also been involved in the protection high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] against the excessive lipid accumulation in the liver, or in regulation lipid metabolism to modulate the body weight via alternatively activate macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Whether IL-25 is involved in the biogenesis of Brown-in-white (Brite)/beige adipocytes and associated metabolic disorders is not known.</p>
<p>Moreover, given that the brown and beige adipose tissue can increase thermogenesis by uncoupling the oxidative phosphorylation with UCP1-upregulation, we also hypothesized that constitutively expressed IL-25 induces beige adipose tissue and improves metabolic homeostasis and thermogenesis, and that enhanced IL-25 production in vivo would protect against insulin resistance. The present study was aimed at investigating 1) the effects of &#x03B2;-agonist or cold exposure on IL-25 expression in the adipose tissue, 2) the effects of IL-25 on Brite/beige adipocytes of the white adipose tissue, 3) the role of macrophage during the process that IL-25 induces the beige fat, and 4) whether IL-25 improves the homeostasis against insulin resistance.</p>

<title>IL-25 signaling increased in beige adipose tissue upon &#x03B2;3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation or cold exposure</title>
<p>To investigate the role of IL-25 signaling in the modulation of beige adipose tissue, we chose physiological and classical Brite models in vivo. First, after administration of &#x03B2;3-adrenoceptor agonist (CL-316, 243 (CL)) to 8-week old C57BL/6J mice, a robust browning phenotype characterized as high expression of UCP-1 and multilocular adipocytes in adipose tissue was found (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-1C</xref>, S1A-S1C). Time-course analysis showed that CL induced the expression of IL-25 and its cognate receptor, IL-17RB, in subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and 1D) and epididymal WAT (eWAT) (Figure S1A and S1D). The expression of IL-25 was further confirmed to be induced by CL in scWAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel) and eWAT (Figure S1E left panel) by ELISA. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref> (left panel) shows that higher IL-25 in adipose tissue did not increase circulatory IL-25.</p>

<p>Wild type mice were injected with CL (1mg/kg body weight) for 2 (CL-2d) and 5 days (CL-5d), or were placed at controlled temperature (22&#x00B0;C) and cold challenge (4&#x00B0;C) in independently cages for 48h (n&#x003D;4-5 per treatment).

<p>Next, wild type mice were separated into two groups and housed at 22&#x00B0;C or 4&#x00B0;C, respectively, for 2 days. Cold exposure induced a comparable beige phenotype in scWAT characterized as up-regulation of UCP1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-1H</xref>). However, such elevation of UCP1 was not observed in eWAT (Figure S1F-S1H), suggesting that cold-induced sympathetic activation preferentially stimulates the browning in scWAT only. Similarly, the expression of IL-25 and IL-17RB was examined at different temperature. Concomitant to the browning of WAT, cold acclimation also preferentially resulted in an increase of IL-17RB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and1I) and IL-25 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> right panel) in scWAT. As expected, cold exposure did not increase circulatory IL-25 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref> right panel). Unexpectedly, cold exposure only increased IL-25 and IL-17RB in scWAT, did not change in eWAT (Figure S1F, S1I, S1E right panel and S1J left panel), and decreased in the liver (Figure S1J right panel).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Administration of IL-25 induced the browning of scWAT and repressed DIO chronic low-grade inflammation in vivo</title>
<p>To further investigate whether pharmacologic treatment of IL-25 would induce thermogenic gene expression and browning of WAT, recombinant IL-25 was intraperitoneally administered to normal control mice for 7 days. Figure 2A shows that IL-25 increased the expression of UCP1 protein in scWAT, but not in BAT, in a dose-dependent manner. As the expression of UCP1 also increased after a high dose of IL-25 (1000ng/d) administered in eWAT (Figure 2A), the dose of 1000ng/d for IL-25 was applied in the following experiment. Furthermore, to validate the activity of recombinant IL-25, its receptor, IL-17RB, was also examined and shown to be up-regulated (Figure 2B). Western-blot and RT-qPCR analysis showed that IL-25 induced the expression of UCP1 (Figure 2B and2C). Histologic analysis showed that beige fat was characterized as high expression of the specific mitochondrial UCP1 and multilocular morphology in scWAT and eWAT after IL-25 treatment (Figure 2D and 2E). These data suggested that IL-25 stimulated the development of beige fat.</p>
<p>We next analyzed whether IL-25 could suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and increase the expression of anti-inflammatory genes in diet-induced-obesity (DIO) chronic inflammatory adipose tissue. Figure 2F shows that IL-25 promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-13 and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-&#x03B3;, IL-1&#x03B2; and IL-6.</p>
<p>Next, to further explore the mechanism of IL-25-induced beige, recombinant IL-25 was applied to treat the differentiated 3T3-L1 MBX adipocytes in vitro. As CL might induce the expression of thermogenic or &#x03B2;-oxidation genes in adipocytes in vitro, it was used as a positive control. Figure 2G and 2H show that IL-25 did not augment the expression of thermogenic or &#x03B2;-oxidation genes such as Ucp1, Pgc-1&#x03B1;, Acsl1 and Acox1 at various doses of treatment.</p>

<title>IL-25 increased the level of IL-4 to stimulate the browning of adipose tissue via inducing alternatively activated macrophages</title>
<p>Figure 3A shows that IL-25 induced the macrophage phenotype switch from pro-inflammatory classically activated macrophages (iNOS as marker) to anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages (ARG1 and YM1 as marker). IL-25 also increased the expression of IL-4 and IL-13 (Figure 3B and3C), which is important for induction of alternative activation program in adipose tissue. However, these changes were not found when treated with irisin (Figure 3D), a myokine that induces the browning of adipose tissue via actions on adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>As IL-25 may induce alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages and promote IL-4 expression, to explore whether the effects of IL-25 and IL-4 promote the commitment of APs to the beige fat lineage, APs were isolated from scWAT, pretreated with IL-4 or IL-25, and then studied their effects on beige adipocytes. Figure 3E shows that the IL-4-pretreated-Aps, rather than the IL-25-pretreated-Aps, enhanced the expression of UCP1. While APs were co-cultured with peritoneal macrophages treated with IL-25, UCP1 expressed in the APs and then repressed in the presence of IL-4R&#x03B1; neutralizing antibody (Figure 3F). Next, anti-IL-4R&#x03B1; antibody was intraperitoneally injected into IL-25-treated normal control mice. Disruption of IL-4/IL-13 signaling with IL-4R&#x03B1; neutralizing antibody decreased the IL-25-induced mRNA expression and alternatively activated macrophages marker genes in adipose tissues (Figure 3G). Western-blot and RT-qPCR analysis of adipose tissues showed that the expression of UCP1 were increased in WT mice treated with IL-25, whilst blockade of IL-4R&#x03B1; blunted the expression of UCP1 (Figure 3G and 3H).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>IL-25 regulated adipose tissue innervation by macrophages</title>
<p>As blockade of IL-4R&#x03B1; by its antibody did not entirely inhibit IL-25-induced expression of UCP1 (Figure 3G and 3H), we explored alternative mechanisms, i.e., enhancing innervation of scWAT and eWAT. Figure 4A and 4B show that expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was induced after IL-25 administration. Histological staining of TH in scWAT and eWAT showed more sympathetic axons in the IL-25-treated mice than those in the PBS-treated mice (Figure 4C). Similarly, IL-25 also increased the level of norepinephrine in scWAT and eWAT (Figure 4D). These results showed that the IL-25 injection significantly enhanced innervation of scWAT and eWAT.</p>
<p>To further investigate whether brown-adipose-tissue macrophages regulate tissue innervations, we applied clodronate-loaded liposomes to deplete macrophages in DIO mice. Figure 4E shows that depletion of macrophages in DIO mice clearly blunted the IL-25-induced expression of TH and UCP1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>IL-25 improved the metabolic homeostasis on DIO mice</title>
<p>To investigate whether IL-25 could improve obesity and related metabolic disorder in DIO mice, we firstly fed the C57/BL6J mice with high-fat diet for 12 weeks. After that, the DIO mice were subsequently administered with different doses of IL-25 for another 14 days. At the same time with the administration of IL-25, IL-4 was used as a positive control with a dose of 1&#x03BC;g/mouse, because of its effect on inducing the browning of adipose tissue in HFD-fed mice. Figure 5A shows that IL-25 increased the expression of UCP1 protein in a dose-dependent manner in scWAT and eWAT of DIO mice.</p>
<p>Figure 5B shows that the expression of both UCP1 and TH decreased in DIO adipose tissue, but increased after treated with IL-25, and the change in both UCP1 and TH was only found in scWAT and eWAT, but not in BAT (Figure 5B). The browning effects were shown in the histologic images of scWAT and eWAT, in which adipocytes share biochemical (e.g., high expression of the specific mitochondrial UCP1) and morphological (e.g., high mitochondrial content and multilocular lipid droplet) with BAT in HFD-fed mice treated with IL-25 (Figure 5C and 5D, Figure S2A and S2B). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that administration of IL-25 induced the expression of the thermogenic genes, including <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Ppargc1&#x03B1;</italic>, <italic>Dio2</italic>, and <italic>Acox1</italic> in HFD-fed mice (Figure S2C and S2D).</p>
<p>Next, to determine whether IL-25 could improve homeostasis against obesity and related metabolic dysfunction via beige fat, total body mass, adipose tissue, GTT and ITT, were examined. Figure S3 shows that beige adipose tissue induced by cold exposure improved the metabolic homeostasis. Those HFD-fed mice treated with IL-25 significantly gained less weight (Figure 5E) and fat mass of eWAT (Figure S2E) compared with those without treatment of IL-25. The adipocyte size of scWAT and eWAT was also decreased (Figure S2F). HFD-fed mice treated with IL-25 also showed lower levels of liver weight and lipids than those without treatment (Figure S2G). Furthermore, a concomitant decrease in blood glucose in the HFD-fed mice was found after IL-25 administration (Figure 5F). Figure 5G and 5H show that, in the HFD-fed mice, those with IL-25 treatment significantly improved glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity compared with those without treatment. As liver, eWAT and muscle from NCD- or HFD-fed mice might reduce p-AKT activity stimulated by insulin, those tissues in mice treated with IL-25 restored the decrease (Figure 5I).</p>

<title>Macrophage depletion and UCP1 knockout ameliorated IL-25-mediated improvement in glucose homeostasis</title>
<p>To investigate whether IL-25 regulates its anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects through macrophages, we used DIO mice which were administered with clodronate-loaded liposomes to deplete macrophages in adipose tissue without F4/80, a marker of macrophage, expression (Figure S4A). Figure 6 shows that the stimulatory effect of IL-25 on anti-diabetic was largely depended on macrophages. IL-25 did not reduce fasting blood glucose (Figure 6A), or improve glucose tolerance (Figure 6B) and insulin sensitivity (Figure 6C) in DIO mice treated with clodronate-loaded liposomes. However, IL-25 reduced body weight gain (Figure S4B) and eWAT mass (Figure S4C), lowered liver weight (Figure S4D) in DIO mice as effective as in DIO mice treated with clodronate-loaded liposomes, suggesting that the effect of IL-25 against obesity does not require macrophages. The results above demonstrated that the anti-diabetic effect of IL-25 was dependent on macrophages, while its anti-obesity effect was not.</p>
<p>To investigate whether IL-25 protect from obesity and metabolic associated disorder in DIO mice by stimulating the development of beige fat, wild type (UCP1<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup>) and UCP1-null (UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) mice were fed with high-fat diet for 12 weeks and then administered with IL-25 (1&#x03BC;g/mouse) or vehicle for 14 days. During the high fat feeding, no detectable difference between UCP1<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> and UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice in body mass was found (Figure S4E). Genetic ablation of UCP1 may not influence IL-25-mediated anti-obesity effect, because IL-25 reduced body weight gain (Figure S4F) and eWAT mass (Figure S4G), lowered liver weight (Figure S4H) in obese UCP1<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> as effective as in obese UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. IL-25-mediated improvement in glucose clearance was abrogated in obese UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, as IL-25 did not reduce fasting blood glucose (Figure 6D), or improve glucose tolerance (Figure 6E) and insulin sensitivity (Figure 6F) in obese UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. These results indicated that UCP1 played an important role in IL-25-mediated anti-diabetic effect but not in effects on lowering body weight.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified that IL-25 signaling including IL-25 and its receptor IL-17RB increased in mice beige adipose tissue induced by &#x03B2;3-adrenoceptor agonist and cold exposure. Administration of IL-25 promoted the browning of WAT associated with significantly less weight gain and improved glucose and insulin tolerance in HFD-fed obese mice. Importantly, IL-25 may induce beige fat and enhance adipose tissue thermogenesis by alternatively activating macrophages to increase the level of catecholamine, excluding the simple and direct effect of IL-25 on adipocytes. These data provide novel evidence that macrophages were involved in the development of beige fat, and IL-25, serving as a cytokine that connects macrophages and thermogenesis in mice, may play a potential therapeutic role in obesity and associated metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>Our study showed that both &#x03B2;3-agonist (1mg/kg body weight for 2 days) and cold exposure (4&#x00B0;C for 2 days) led to a robust browning phenotype as well as activating IL-25 signal in scWAT, whereas in eWAT only &#x03B2;3-agonist led to the beige effect and cold exposure did not. Jia R. and colleagues had demonstrated the differential responses to cold-induced changes of UCP1 across discrete BAT and WAT depots, which supported the notion that the effects of short-term cold exposure increased thermogenic capacity of BAT, as well as browning of scWAT and, to a lesser extent and later, eWAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the white-to-brown induction of IL-25 firstly appear in the easily beige scWAT such as inguinal WAT. Because cold exposure failure to induce beige in eWAT in a short time (&#x003C; 2 days) and the difference exist between scWAT and eWAT in the aspect of thermogenesis, the discrepancy of IL-25-induced beige fat also showed the differential responses to IL-25 across discrete BAT and WAT depots. Though IL-25 signaling participated the development of beige fat from white adipose tissue, sharing the biochemical (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis and high UCP1) and morphological (e.g., robust OXPHOS immunostaining and multilocular lipid droplets) characters with BAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], BAT UCP1 level is unchanged, which suggests that IL-25 could not affect the function of BAT. In addition to stimulating thermogenesis, IL-25 can suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Previous studies had demonstrated that the browning of WAT was closely related with changes in the expression of inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and obese mice displayed higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study comprehensively explored the mechanism involving in the process of IL-25 inducing beige fat. IL-25 is considered to be different from other peptide-like inducers, such as irisin that directly acts on adipocytes to stimulate the development of WAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. We directly applied IL-25 on APs, but it could not promote differentiation of APs to beige adipocytes. Using IL-25 to pharmacologically activate alternatively activated macrophages in normal control mice, we were able to place alternatively activated macrophages to the environment of IL-25-induced browning WAT. When APs were co-cultured with peritoneal macrophages, IL-25 could promote APs differentiation towards beige adipocytes via macrophage. Importantly, this phenomenon was disappeared when using IL-4R&#x03B1; neutralizing antibody in the co-culture medium, suggesting that IL-25 promote APs towards beige depend on IL-4 and IL-4R&#x03B1;. IL-4R&#x03B1; is an essential receptor for IL-4/IL-13 inducing alternatively activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and IL-4 can activate the IL-4R&#x03B1; signaling in adipocyte precursors (APs) and promote the APs to the beige fat lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. We validated the fact that IL-25-induced alternatively activated macrophages released IL-4, and then activated the IL-4R&#x03B1; signaling in APs and promoted the APs to the beige fat lineage in vitro. On the contrary, blockade of IL-4R&#x03B1; in vivo significantly blunted IL-25-induced expression of UCP1. Collectively, these data suggest that IL-25 regulates the browning of WAT via macrophages and APs involving with IL-4 signal pathway.</p>
<p>We found that blockade of IL-4R&#x03B1; could not entirely inhibit IL-25-induced expression of UCP1, suggesting that IL-25 also might participate the development of beige fat with other mechanism. The fact that scWAT characterizes as prominent regional variation in beige fat biogenesis with localization of UCP1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> beige adipocytes to areas with dense sympathetic neurites, and the density of sympathetic projections dependent on PRDM16 in adipocytes, provides another potential mechanism underlying the metabolic benefits mediated by PRDM16 and UCP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The development of beige fat requires noradrenergic stimulation from sympathetic nerve system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Norepinephrine (NE) production by axons that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) has been shown to be important for this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Under the circumstance of cold exposure, sensing cold stimulation by hypothalamus results in enhanced sympathetic nerve branch to induce the browning of WAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. TH mainly present in the cytosol and in some extent in the neuron plasma membrane, catalyzes the rate limiting step in the initial reaction for the biosynthesis of catecholamines such as NE packing in vesicles and exporting through the synaptic membrane.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine released through innervation has been shown to be important for the browning of WAT. This study identified that IL-25 could enhance the sympathetic innervation and then induce the expression of NE in WAT. It was reported that alternatively activated macrophages synthesize NE to sustain adaptive thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Whether alternatively activated macrophages are involved in the production of catecholamines to sustain adaptive thermogenesis seem controversial, for that alternatively activated macrophages were reported not to synthesize catecholamines or not to contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. We directly applied IL-25 on peritoneal macrophages to induce alternatively activated macrophages, but failed to induce the expression of TH. This result suggested that IL-25 could not produce NE by alternative activation of macrophages. It was recently illustrated that brown-adipose tissue macrophages controlled tissue innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In this study, we administered IL-25 to DIO mice with macrophage depletion by clodronate-loaded liposomes, and found that absence of macrophages impaired IL-25-induced sympathetic nerve branching and browning of WAT. Therefore, we considered that IL-25 regulated WAT innervation and released catecholamines such as NE to induce beige fat by macrophages. Although something is still unknown, modulation of the immune environment in adipose tissue by special cytokines can stimulate the biogenesis of beige fat. For example, accumulation and activation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) by IL-33 could induce the browning of white adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>After the effect of IL-25-inducing beige fat had been investigated, the role of which on the thermogenesis and metabolic homeostasis was further explored. In this model, IL-25 decreased body weight gain, improved glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity. The effect of IL-25-mediated improvement in glucose clearance showed a marked dependence on macrophages. IL-25 failed to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in DIO mice with macrophages depletion. And the anti-obesity effect of IL-25 did not require macrophages for that depletion of macrophages could not impaired IL-25-mediated lowering of body weight. The data from UCP1<sup>&#x002B;/&#x002B;</sup> and UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice clearly indicated that IL-25 required UCP1 to promote glucose clearance but not in its role of anti-obesity via lipolysis. For the anti-obesity action of IL-25, it was possible to note some lipid metabolism related enzymes, such as lipolytic enzymes (ATGL, MAGL, p-HSL) increased and lipogenic enzymes (ACC) reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Though IL-25 could induce the browning effect, but it was noted that lipolysis in brown adipocytes was not essential for cold-induced thermogenesis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results demonstrated that IL-25 induced beige fat via macrophage, improve the homeostasis, and decreased glucose disposal and insulin resistance. Our study indicated that the activation of IL-25 signaling might play a potential therapeutic role against obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.</p>

<title>Animals and In Vivo Experiment</title>
<p>Wild-type C57/BL6J mice were purchased from the center of laboratory animal of Sun Yat-sen University. UCP1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice with C57/BL6J genetic background were purchased from the model animal research center of Nanjing University. All mice were maintained under 12-hr light-dark cycles with a designed environmental temperature (21&#x00B0;C &#x00B1; 1&#x00B0;C). Four-week-old male mice fed normal control diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD-60&#x0025; kcal fat diet) for 12 weeks to render mice obesity. Except HFD-fed mice, 8 weeks old-male mice were used in all experiments. For cold exposure experiments, C57/BL6J mice were kept under controlled temperature (22&#x00B0;C) at first and then moved to 4&#x00B0;C in independently cages for 48h. For &#x03B2;3-adrenoceptor agonist treatment, C57/BL6J mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administrated with CL-316,243 (1mgkg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, Tocris) or vehicle once daily for indicated time points. For IL-25-inducing browning experiments in NCD- or HFD-fed mice, various dose of IL-25 (Biolegend) or vehicle were injected i.p. once daily for 7 days or 14 days. For irisin-inducing browning experiments in NCD-fed mice, irisin (1&#x03BC;g, PeproTech) or vehicle were injected i.p. once daily for 2 or 5 days. For IL-4R&#x03B1; neutralization in vivo, 125&#x03BC;g IL-4R&#x03B1; (Cat # 552288, BD Bioscience) or isotype control Ab (Cat # 554687, BD Bioscience) with or without 1&#x03BC;g IL-25 (Biolegend) were diluted with PBS to volume of 0.3ml and injected i.p. twice a week at day 1 and day 4. To deplete macrophages, clodronate-loaded liposomes or empty liposomes (0.2ml/mouse) were injected i.p. once every two days starting 5 days before administration with IL-25 (1&#x03BC;g/d, Biolegend). After IL-25-inducing browning in HFD-fed mice, glucose (2gkg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, Sigma) or insulin (0.75Ukg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, Sigma) were injected i.p. to perform intraperitoneal glucose or insulin tolerance tests in overnight-fasted or 8 hr-fasted mice. After injection, blood glucose concentration was measured using a OneTouch Ultra Glucometer (Johnson) at designed time points. For insulin signaling experiments, IL-25-injected HFD-fed mice were administrated with insulin (0.5Ukg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) through the inferior vena cava, and then inguinal adipose tissue (iWAT) namely subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT),liver and muscle were harvested within 10 minutes. Cohorts of &#x2265; 4 mice per genotype or treatment were assembled for all in vivo studies. All in vivo studies were repeated 2-3 independent times.</p>
