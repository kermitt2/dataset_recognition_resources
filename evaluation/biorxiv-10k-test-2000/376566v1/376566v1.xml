<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Natural selection has long been hypothesised to shape ageing patterns, but whether and how ageing contributes to life-history evolution remains elusive. The complexity of various ageing-associated molecular mechanisms and their inherent stochasticity hinder reductionist approaches to the understanding of functional senescence, <italic>i.e.</italic> reduced fecundity and increased mortality. Recent bio-demographic work demonstrated that high-precision statistics of life-history traits such as mortality rates could be used phenomenologically to understand the ageing process. We adopted this approach to study cellular senescence in growth-arrested <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, where damages to functional macromolecules are no longer diluted by fast <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis. We acquired high-quality longitudinal physiological and life history data of large environmentally controlled clonal <italic>E. coli</italic> populations at single-cell resolution, using custom-designed microfluidic devices coupled to time-lapse microscopy. We show that <italic>E. coli</italic> lifespan distributions follow the Gompertz law of mortality, a century-old actuarial observation of human populations, despite developmental, cellular and genetic differences between bacteria and metazoan organisms. Measuring the shape of the hazard functions allowed us to disentangle quantitatively the demographic effects of ageing, which accumulate with time, from age-independent genetic longevity-modulating interventions. A pathway controlling cellular maintenance, the general stress response, not only promotes longevity but also temporally scales the whole distribution by reducing ageing rate. We further show that <italic>E. coli,</italic> constrained by the amount of total biosynthesis, adapt to their natural feast-or-famine lifestyle by modulating the amount of maintenance investment, rendering ageing rate a highly evolvable life-history trait.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The biology of ageing and senescence is centred on the duality of individual frailty and population resiliency. Throughout the course of normal metabolism, components of living systems such as cells, lipids, proteins and DNA inevitably suffer from wear-and-tear such as free-radical damages. This constant and collective decay eventually leads to the loss of vital functions and collapse of individuals. Understanding the way that system failure emerges out of distributed microscopic damages could reveal how functional components are organised into self-maintaining individuals in the first place<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Yet for some organisms in the tree of life, ageing does not lead to increased mortality and declined fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Organisms possess the abilities to repair or replace most of the damages to their components, exemplified by the &#x201C;immortal germ line&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Evolutionary biologists attribute the apparent senescence of metazoan somas to the inadequate investment in cellular maintenance as an adaptive strategy to maximise lifetime reproductive success, due to the trade-offs between the survival and reproduction of the young on one hand, and maintenance for the benefit of the old on the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Presumably, natural selection has to operate through the molecular &#x201C;levers&#x201D; of damage accumulation and/or repair to achieve such life-history optimisation.</p>
<p><italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> a single-cell prokaryote with short lifespans, has historically served as a model organism that resolved many fundamental questions in biology. <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, as their metazoan counterparts, suffer from damages to their components, which lead to cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In exponential growth, these damages are quickly diluted by <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis, and the effects of cellular senescence mitigated by rapid and robust reproduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Yet, the natural life cycle of <italic>E.coli</italic> entails a much wider range of physiological conditions than exponential growth. Most of bacterial cells spend much of their lives in resource-limited growth arrested conditions, where <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis rates are slower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and cells undergo senescence due to the accumulation of molecular damages such as protein misfolding and oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Despite the lack of fixed separation of germ and soma cells, the ability to survive the wear and tear of cellular components during growth arrests contribute to bacterial overall fitness as much as the ability for exponential growth. We, therefore, adopted a bio-demographic approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> to understand how modulation of molecular damage repair could shape ageing dynamics in growth-arrested <italic>E.coli.</italic></p>

Because long-term growth rates in a stable ecosystem remain close to zero, life-history traits in &#x201C;feast&#x201D; and &#x201C;famine&#x201D; conditions should contribute rather equally to overall fitness. In &#x201C;feast&#x201D; conditions, the traits under strong selection are resource assimilation and reproduction, while in &#x201C;famine&#x201D; conditions are maintenance and survival. Senescence has been shown to occur in &#x201C;famine&#x201D; conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p></caption>

<title>Custom-designed microfluidic devices allow longitudinal tracking of vitality at single-cell level</title>
<p>We first set out to acquire high quality longitudinal physiological and life-history data at single-cell resolution of clonal populations of <italic>E.coli.</italic> For decades, limitations of traditional cell culture methods have frustrated quantitative physiologists&#x2019; attempts to understand bacterial maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, due to both media-cell interactions and cellular interaction such as cross-feeding and cannibalism. To be able to measure individual <italic>E.coli</italic> cell lifespan in constant and homogenous environmental settings, we designed a novel microfluidic device with cell-dimension chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Cells are trapped in an array of single-cell-wide dead-ended wells, with openings to a main flow channel. Constant flow of fresh media in this main channel provides necessary nutrients and eliminates metabolic waste, cell debris and intercellular crosstalk so that the environmental conditions are maintained constant over time. Cells with appropriately expressed fluorescent markers are imaged bottom-up and appear as fluorescent spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This experimental system allows easy tracking of cohorts of a large number of individual bacterial cells for prolonged periods (up to 7 days).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="376566_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In order to observe cell mortality, we included in the carbon-source-free medium a red-fluorescent, DNA-binding, bacterial viability dye, Propidium Iodide (P.I.), which penetrates the cells only when cellular membrane potentials are disrupted. P.I. staining has been established as an effective proxy of cellular death and correlates well with cell viability assessed by proliferating potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We used P.I. at a concentration 4-fold lower than the previous concentration that had no effects on <italic>E.coli</italic> viability and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Automatic time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and fixed geometry of our devices allowed longitudinal quantification of P.I. signal for every single cell in the population. We defined the half point between peak P.I. signal and background fluorescence as a threshold to establish the time-of-death. At the end of the experiments, 70&#x0025; ethanol was injected into the device in order to account for every cell in the cohort, and establish a lower bound for the time-of-death of surviving cells. These cells were censored at the time that their P.I. signals crossed their respective thresholds (see Methods).</p>
<p>Despite being genetically clonal and environmentally controlled, cells did not share the same time or manner of death, as measured by the P.I. time-series. The transition from life to death of a representative cohort (N&#x003D; 4744) could be visualised by the boundary between dark to light in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>. Because cells were sorted vertically according to estimated lifespans, the shape of this boundary represents the survival function of the population. Considering ageing and death as a stochastic process of system reliability reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the observed time-of-death distribution could be viewed as the population&#x2019;s first-passage time distribution. In addition, we observed individual differences in death trajectories. Short-lived cells tended to have very sharp P.I. increases that associated with abrupt losses of membrane integrity; while those that die late tended to suffer a type of &#x201C;slow death&#x201D; characterised by a gradual P.I. increase over the course of 10-15 hours.</p>

<title><italic>E. coli</italic> lifespan distributions follow the Gompertz law</title>
<p>For both demographers and reliability engineers, the age-associated increase in death probability, also known as the hazard rate h(t), is considered to be a hallmark of ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The detailed population statistics derived from our experiments are particularly useful in estimating the shape of the hazard functions over the whole lifespan. We find that <italic>E.coli</italic> lifespan distributions have, as their main feature, regimes with exponentially increasing hazard rates, <italic>i.e.</italic> the Gompertz law of mortality <italic>h(t)</italic> &#x007E; <italic>h(t<sub>0</sub></italic>) <italic>e<sup>b(t-t0)</sup></italic>, where <italic>h(t<sub>0</sub></italic>) is the initial hazard rate and <italic>b</italic> is the Gompertz ageing rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We estimated <italic>h(t)</italic> directly with binomial error by binning mortality events within discrete time intervals (<italic>&#x03C4;<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>&#x03C4;<sub>i&#x002B;1</sub></italic>), <italic>i.e</italic>. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="376566_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where Y<sub>i</sub> is the number of individuals at risk at time &#x03C4;i and di is the number of cell deaths within (&#x03C4;<sub>i</sub>, &#x03C4;<sub>i&#x002B;1</sub>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). For wildtype cells, this exponential regime spans from about 13 hours to 93 hours, corresponding to approximately 90&#x0025; of all cell deaths (N<sub>total</sub>&#x003D;4744, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>, top x-axis), and ranges at least 100-fold changes in hazard rates (2&#x002A;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 2&#x002A;10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Within this exponential regime, the doubling time of hazard rate is 9.4&#x00B1;0.5 hours. In comparison, the doubling time of human mortality hazards is about 8 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Hazard rates not only define lifespan distributions but can also be thought of as surrogates for system vulnerability, whose dynamics through time reflect the physiological consequence of ageing. In this light, the Gompertz law can be interpreted as a dynamic equation governing the ageing process: <italic>dh(t)/dt</italic> &#x003D; <italic>bh(t)</italic>, where <italic>b</italic> is the Gompertz ageing rate. The integral version, <italic>h(t)</italic> &#x003D; <italic>bH(t)&#x002B;h(t<sub>0</sub>)</italic>, where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="376566_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, can be directly observed in the phase plane of the cumulative hazards <italic>H(t)</italic> without any free parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The integral equation is used because <italic>H(t)</italic> can be estimated independent of binning, by using the Nelson-Aalen (N-A) estimator <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="376566_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The fact that the theoretical trajectory, including the aforementioned linear regime, lies within the confidence intervals (CI) of almost every state coordinate <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="376566_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> lends strong statistical credence to the Gompertz law for describing our data. In addition, the observed trajectory in the phase plane links the instantaneous hazard rate <italic>h(t)</italic> at any given time <italic>t</italic>, with the total proportion of population that have died before time <italic>t</italic> (because <italic>H(t) &#x003D; &#x2212;In[S(t)]</italic>, where <italic>S(t)</italic> is the survival function).</p>
<p>The hazard rate observed deviates from the exponential regime at the beginning (t&#x003C;15 hours, 3&#x0025; cell deaths) and the end (t&#x003E;93 hours, 7&#x0025; cell deaths) of the total lifespan. These observations are reminiscent of similar deviations from Gompertz law in human mortality data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In our case, the additional mortality at the early age might result from harvesting and transferring exponentially growing cells from batch culture directly to growth-arresting conditions inside our microfluidic chip, in a way analogous to infant mortality in human mortality data, which can be modelled by an age-independent component (<italic>&#x03BB;</italic> in the Gompertz-Makeham model <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="376566_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> controls the age at which the Gompertz regime overtakes the Makeham term <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>).</p>
<p>Late-life hazard decelerations are common phenomena for both model organisms and human populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. It is thought that these hazard decelerations often do not reflect ageing decelerations for individuals, but result from changes in composition of heterogeneous populations. The more fragile individuals are more likely to die and be removed from the cohort. When hazard rates are high late in life, significant portions of the populations are removed so that the observed hazard rates of the surviving populations would be smaller than the original cohorts on average. We found that an extension to the Gompertz law named Gamma-Gompertz, originally used to model old-age human model data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, could also satisfactorily model late life decelerations in our data, for both wildtype and mutant strains (see below). It could be understood as accounting for the compositional changes by an additional parameter, <italic>s</italic>, controlling the level of frailty heterogeneity: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="376566_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where S<sub>gg</sub>(t) is the survival function of Gamma-Gompertz, and other parameters are as before. Despite being genetically and environmentally non-distinguishable, we think it is reasonable to assume frailty heterogeneity exist in our singlecell populations due to the stochastic nature of cellular biochemistry, explaining the suitability of the Gamma-Gompertz for our data.</p>
<p>We thus used the Gamma-Gompertz-Makeham (GGM) extension model with 4 parameters to fully model our data across the whole lifespan, with parameters estimated by likelihood maximisation:

<p>Goodness-of-fit was evaluated using a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for right-censored survival time data. The appropriateness of the model terms was evaluated by comparing Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of the candidate models (see methods).</p>

<title>The general stress response of <italic>E. coli</italic> modulates the ageing rate</title>
<p>Evolutionary theories of ageing predict the existence of ageing-modulating mechanisms and their activation by nutrient limitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Several nutrient-sensing pathways in both bacteria and metazoans have been shown to control stress resistance and reduce mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Yet their roles in delaying ageing-related damage accumulations are often controversial. It is often difficult and requires large experimental cohorts to disentangle their effects on ageing from age-independent components of longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Having established a method to measure ageing rates using high-quality mortality statistics, we harnessed this system to shed light on potential ageing-modulating mechanisms of <italic>E.coli</italic> that might be activated in response to nutrient deprivation.</p>
<p>Many bacteria species regulate the level of cellular maintenance through a genetic pathway called general stress response (GSR), controlled by the master transcriptional regulator <italic>rpoS</italic> that is activated by nutrient-deprivation among other signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To assess the role of rpoS-controlled cellular maintenance in the ageing of growth-arrested <italic>E.coli,</italic> we measured the lifespan distributions of two GSR mutants, <italic>&#x0394;rpoS,</italic> and <italic>&#x0394;rssB</italic> with that of the wildtype strain. <italic>&#x0394;rpoS</italic> is the null mutant and <italic>&#x0394;rssB</italic> displays an elevated GSR due to increased RpoS stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We observed that higher GSR promotes longevity in the microfluidic experiments, whereas the absence of GSR results in shortened longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Our large sample sizes allowed us to directly measure the hazard dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>) of each strain, which could disentangle GSR&#x2019;s effects on ageing rate, as opposed to age-independent components of longevity.</p>

<p>Significantly, we found that increased GSR reduces the rate of ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Given how well the GGM model fitted for all 3 strains, the impact of genotypes on ageing parameters such as ageing rates could be extracted using generalised linear models (GLM). With enhanced GSR, <italic>&#x0394;rssB</italic> cells double their mortality risk every 14.1 hours, with a 95&#x0025; CI ranging from 13.1 to 15.3 hours, compared to 9.4 hours for the wildtype (CI 8.9 - 9.9 hours) and 7.3 hours for the null strain <italic>&#x0394;rpoS</italic> (CI 6.8 to 7.7 hours).

<title>Evolutionary trade-offs mediated by the general stress response</title>
<p>Is slower ageing an adaptive life-history trait? This was one of original question raised by Sir Peter Medawar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> that motivated much of later ageing research. Optimal life-history theory suggested that trade-offs and constraints among fitness components shape metazoan ageing rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The possibility of modulating ageing rate through GSR offers us the opportunity to test these ideas in a fast-evolving organism as <italic>E. coli.</italic></p>
<p>The relatively well-understood GSR pathway provides a clear molecular mechanism for a trade-off between growth and maintenance. The master regulator <italic>rpoS</italic> encodes the RNA polymerase (RNAP) sigma subunit &#x03C3;<sup>S</sup>, which competes with the other sigma factors including the vegetative &#x03C3;<sup>D</sup> to recruit the core RNAP and direct the transcription and translation machinery towards the RpoS regulon. By titrating protein synthesis activity away from metabolic and ribosomal genes controlled by &#x03C3;<sup>D</sup>, RpoS activity inhibits growth and nutrient assimilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We measured quantitatively the growth impact of modulating GSR levels, and modelled its effect using a simple course-grained model of proteome sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We found that the proportion of protein synthesis devoted to the RpoS regulon linearly increases the timescale of growth (see top axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the life-history optimality of different ageing rates, we integrated numerically the experimentally derived growth rates and mortality rates into fitness, defined as the long-term population growth rates. In contrast to metazoans, for whom fertility and mortality schedules are connected through fixed age structures, our model of <italic>E. coli</italic> life-history consisted of alternating environmental episodes of varying durations, in which <italic>E. coli</italic> populations either grow (&#x201C;feast&#x201D;), or decline (&#x201C;famine&#x201D;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>). These feast-or-famine cycles were parameterised by two transition rates, controlling respectively the average lengths of &#x201C;feast&#x201D; and &#x201C;famine&#x201D; episodes. In order to identify selective pressure for ageing rates, we directly compared the fitness of the three strains with different GSR phenotypes, each representing a different strategic position in the growth-maintenance trade-off. We identified the environmental regimes selecting for faster or slower ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The boundaries between these regimes were characterised along two axes: lifestyle ratio, defined as the ratio of time spent in &#x201C;famine&#x201D; versus &#x201C;feast&#x201D;; and &#x201C;famine&#x201D; mean residence time, or in other words, average length of &#x201C;famine&#x201D; episodes.</p>
<p>There are two necessary conditions for selecting slower ageing strategies represented by <italic>&#x0394;rssB.</italic> First, populations have to spend much more time in &#x201C;famine&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;feast&#x201D;, so that over the long term, population decline rather than grow. Secondly but no less important, given the same lifestyle ratio, famines should consist of longer episodes rather than short but more frequent ones. This condition is necessary due to the exponential mortality dynamics described by Gompertz law: investing in cellular maintenance only becomes beneficial at old age, when the exponentially increasing benefits of slower ageing eventually overcome the more immediate cost on growth. It is the typical timescale of &#x201C;famine&#x201D; that provides the selective pressure for ageing rates.</p>
<p>Despite representing the complex regulations of GSR with two mutants, we can now understand the ecological role of GSR activation and its adaptive consequences. Activated by declining nutrient availability, GSR directs resources towards internal maintenance to wait out the adverse conditions, whose lengths determine the optimal activation level. Previous observations from experimental evolution of <italic>E. coli</italic> support our predictions. In continuous cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> where the populations do not pass through prolonged growth-arresting bottlenecks, mutations that attenuate or knock out RpoS activity are among the first to arise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In contrast to the isolated populations under constant environmental conditions in our chip experiments, <italic>E. coli</italic> populations in nature influence their environments, and also interact with each other. These interactions may give rise to frequency-dependent selection and evolutionary game dynamics between slower and faster ageing strategies, as is observed in experimental evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We obtained high quality single-cell demographic data, using a novel microfluidic device, to demonstrate that ageing of growth-arrested <italic>E. coli</italic> follows the Gompertz law of mortality. Moreover, bacterial general stress response could temporally rescale the lifespan distribution by modulating the ageing rate. We further articulated in a demographic model the trade-offs and selective pressure driving the evolution of ageing rate.</p>
<p>In our work, two different conceptual perspectives of ageing are integrated and applied to one of the most iconic model organism, <italic>E. coli.</italic> One perspective, held by biochemists and physicists, sees ageing as the stochastic and inevitable erosion of organismal order and biochemical redundancy, created by self-reproducing and self-maintaining networks during growth and development. The other perspective, from evolutionary biology, views ageing as a component of the organismal life-history strategy, optimised and fine-tuned by natural selection. These two approaches constitute the proximate and ultimate causes of ageing respectively, with the former providing the constraints and the &#x201C;lever&#x201D; for the latter. In bacteria, we indeed observed the stochastic process of ageing and mortality. Lifespan vary significantly among genetically identical individuals in constant, homogeneous environment.</p>
<p>However, at the population level, ageing is characterised qualitatively by the Gompertz law of mortality. In response to environmental conditions, the lifespan distribution is modulated by regulatory and selective forces through temporal scaling, while its general, exponential, shape is preserved. These new empirical observations provided an integrated perspectives to bacterial ageing, and by extension, potentially to the breath of the tree of life.</p>
<p>Although the Gompertz law has been shown to characterise ageing of many metazoan organisms, the physiological correlates of its parameters are not well understood. To rescale the lifespan distribution without changing the general shape of hazard dynamics, GSR has to orchestrate a coordinated response to manage various molecular damages that the organism encounters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, RpoS regulates hundreds of genes conferring resistance to both internal and external stresses such as oxidative, thermal, acid, alkaline, osmotic, and UV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. For this reason, the ageing rate in our case reflects the general level of macromolecular catabolism and may relate to the maintenance energy of bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We hypothesise that the energetic costs of homeostasis and molecular damage repair are paid by the loss of biomass, leading to the gradual increase in the probability of death. It is the rate of energy dissipation, or the rate of living, that correlates with the ageing rate in our system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Gompertz law of mortality informs and constraints physiological models of ageing and mortality in growth-arrested <italic>E.coli</italic> cells. Depicted are the abstract states and pathways cells pass through during ageing and mortality. Acute damages to essential cellular components, when unrepaired, often lead to cell death, quantified by <italic>h(t)</italic>. Cells could also triage and repair these damages to return themselves back to physiological homeostasis. The energy cost of this maintenance process, <italic>J(t)</italic>, termed maintenance energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, need to be repaid by either an external energy source or internal storage in the form of existing biomass. If we assume it is the same set of acute molecular damages that kill the cells or lead to ageing, then <italic>J(t)</italic> could relate to <italic>h(t)</italic> proportionally, <italic>J(t)</italic> &#x003D; <italic>R h(t)</italic> (eq1), where <italic>R</italic> is the &#x201C;friction&#x201D; coefficient controlled by the relative proportions of the two fates of damaged cells: repair vs death. For carbon-starved cells in our experiments, this flux of energy dissipation decreases the capacity for molecular repair in the future, <italic>U(t)</italic>, leading to cellular senescence. Put it another way, <italic>dU(t)/dt</italic> &#x003D; -<italic>J(t)</italic> (eq2). Through these assumptions, the hazard dynamics we described in this work could be recast as the dynamics of maintenance capacity. Our experimental results place non-trivial constraints on how the amount of maintenance capacity regulates the rate at which cells are damaged molecularly in the first place. If we only consider the Gompertz regime, <italic>i.e. dh(t)/dt</italic> &#x003D; <italic>bh(t)</italic> (eq3), combining with (eq1) (eq2) and differentiating on both sides, we have <italic>d<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>Uldt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></italic> &#x002B; <italic>b dU/dt</italic> &#x003D; 0 (eq3) and <italic>dU(t)ldt</italic> &#x003D; -<italic>R h(0)</italic>, where <italic>b</italic> is the Gompertz ageing rate and R balance out the choice of t0 which should not alter the dynamics of (eq3). This framework could also be extended to growing populations by considering the equation <italic>d<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>Uldt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></italic> &#x002B; <italic>b dU/dt &#x002B; c(U)</italic> &#x003D; 0, where <italic>c(U)</italic> is zero in low levels of <italic>U</italic> such as in growth arrest conditions, but theoretically could be larger than zero, pushing the physiology away from senescence but toward rejuvenation.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Despite the simplicity of bacteria and its vast differences from animals, we find that concepts in evolutionary theories of ageing, such as antagonistic pleiotropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, still apply. RpoS mediates trade-offs between growth and maintenance, between assimilation of nutrients and dissimilation of biomass. Sigma competition, a well-understood mechanism in the physiology of bacterial stress response, provides a molecular basis for such trade-offs often only hypothesised in metazoan organisms. Activated by nutritional deprivation and shown to decrease the ageing rate, GSR has immediate analogies in calorie-restriction-induced longevity of metazoan model organisms. Whereas in many studies on animal models, calorie-restriction-related pathways have only been shown to promote longevity, our demographic data allow us to show that GSR indeed changes the rate of ageing. It can be thought of as not only providing resistance against stress, but also insurance against prolonged growth arrests, or in other words, protection against the progression of time.</p>
<p>In the future, the experimental approach and statistical framework described here could combine with classical genetic methods to examine further ways hazard dynamics could be perturbed, and to reveal dynamic features of the complex network shaping cellular senescence under various environmental constraints. Future modelling efforts should clarify how adaptive processes could optimise redundancy of living systems, in trade-offs with other traits, to produce the Gompertz law.</p>
