<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway consists of transmembrane ligands and receptors that can interact both within the same cell (<italic>cis</italic>) and across cell boundaries (<italic>trans</italic>). Previous work has shown that <italic>cis</italic>-interactions act to inhibit productive signaling. Here, by analyzing Notch activation in single cells while controlling cell density and ligand expression level, we show that <italic>cis</italic>-ligands can in fact activate Notch receptors. This <italic>cis</italic>-activation process resembles <italic>trans</italic>-activation in its ligand level dependence, susceptibility to <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition, and sensitivity to Fringe modification. Cis-activation occurred for multiple ligand-receptor pairs, in diverse cell types, and affected survival and differentiation in neural stem cells. Finally, mathematical modeling shows how <italic>cis</italic>-activation could potentially expand the capabilities of Notch signaling, for example enabling &#x201C;negative&#x201D; signaling. These results establish <italic>cis</italic>-activation as a prevalent mode of signaling in the Notch pathway, and should contribute to a more complete understanding of how Notch signaling functions in developmental, physiological, and biomedical contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway enables intercellular communication in animals. It plays critical roles in diverse developmental and physiological processes, and is often mis-regulated in disease, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Siebel and Lendahl 2017</xref>). Notch signaling occurs when membrane-bound ligands such as Dll1 and Dll4 on one cell activate Notch receptors on neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>trans</italic>-activation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Artavanis-Tsakonas, Rand, and Lake 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">J. T. Nichols, Miyamoto, and Weinmaster 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bray 2016</xref>). However, other types of interactions are also known to occur. Intercellular interactions between Notch1 and the ligand Jag1 have been shown to block <italic>trans</italic>-activation during angiogenesis and in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>trans</italic>-inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Benedito et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hicks et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Golson et al. 2009</xref>). Additionally, Notch ligands and receptors co-expressed in the same cell have been shown to mutually inhibit one another, suppressing productive intercellular signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">del &#x00C1;lamo, Rouault, and Schweisguth 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fiuza, Klein, and Martinez Arias 2010</xref>). Such &#x2018;<italic>cis</italic>-inhibition&#x2019; has been shown to be important in diverse developmental processes including neurogenesis, wing margin formation in Drosophila, and maintenance of postnatal human epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Micchelli, Rulifson, and Blair 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jacobsen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Franklin et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lowell et al. 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>The ability of co-expressed Notch ligands and receptors to interact on the same cell provokes the question of whether such interactions might also lead to pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, &#x2018;<italic>cis</italic>-activation&#x2019;). <italic>Cis</italic>-activation has been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Formosa-Jordan and Iba&#x00F1;es 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hsieh and Lo 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Coumailleau et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pelullo et al. 2014</xref>), but has not been systematically investigated. A key challenge in identifying and characterizing such a behavior is the difficulty of discriminating between <italic>trans</italic>- and <italic>cis</italic>-activation in a multicellular tissue context, i.e. attributing any observed Notch signal to <italic>trans</italic> or <italic>cis</italic> ligand-receptor interactions. It has therefore remained unclear whether and where <italic>cis</italic>-activation occurs, how it compares to <italic>trans</italic>-activation, and how it might co-exist with <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition.</p>
<p>Here, we used single cell imaging to investigate activation in isolated cells. We find that <italic>cis</italic>-activation is a pervasive property of the Notch signaling pathway. It occurs for multiple ligands (Dll1 and Dll4) and receptors (Notch1 and Notch2), and in diverse cell types, including fibroblastic CHO-K1 cells, epithelial NMuMG and Caco-2 cells, and in neural stem cells. Cis-activation resembles <italic>trans</italic>-activation in the magnitude of the signaling response, modulation by R-Fringe, and susceptibility to <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition at high ligand concentrations. Furthermore, <italic>cis</italic>-activation appears to impact the survival and differentiation of neural stem cells. Finally, mathematical modeling shows that <italic>cis</italic>-activation could expand the capabilities of the Notch pathway, potentially enabling &#x201C;negative&#x201D; Notch signaling and integration of information about levels of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-ligand. Together, these results extend the range of Notch signaling modes and provoke new questions about how <italic>cis</italic>-activation could function in diverse processes.</p>

<title>Notch1-Dll1 cells show ligand-dependent cis-activation</title>
<p>To analyze <italic>cis</italic>-activation, we sought to develop a synthetic platform that could allow tuning of Notch pathway components and quantitative single-cell read-out of pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used the CHO-K1 cell line, which does not naturally express Notch receptors or ligands and has been used in previous studies of the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">LeBon et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nandagopal et al. 2018</xref>). We engineered these cells to co-express the Notch ligand Dll1, a chimeric Notch1ECD-Gal4 receptor, as well as the Gal4-activated H2B-Citrine fluorescent reporter gene that enables readout of Notch activation (Materials and methods). In these engineered cell lines, receptors are expressed constitutively. Dll1 expression can be induced using the small molecule 4-epi-Tetracycline (4-epiTc) in a dose-dependent manner, and monitored using a co-translational H2B-mCherry fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">LeBon et al. 2014</xref>). Upon activation by Notch ligand, the chimeric N1ECD-Gal4 releases Gal4, which can travel to the nucleus and activate H2B-Citrine expression. Engineered cells also express a Radical Fringe (Rfng) gene, which enhances Notch1-Dll1 interactions through receptor glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Moloney et al. 2000</xref>). Finally, these &#x2018;N1D1&#x002B;Rfng&#x2019; cells also constitutively express nuclear-localized H2B-Cerulean fluorescent protein, which enables their identification in co-culture assays.</p>
<p>To discriminate <italic>cis</italic>-activation from <italic>trans</italic>-activation, we isolated individual N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells by co-culturing a minority of N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells (1&#x0025;) with an excess of wild-type CHO-K1 cells (<italic>&#x2018;cis</italic>-activation assay&#x2019;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). We first verified that their relative density was low enough to prevent <italic>trans</italic>-interactions between them, by confirming that a similar fraction of pure receiver cells, which express Notch1 but no ligands, were not activated by N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). We then used time-lapse microscopy to measure Notch activity in N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells in the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay (Materials and methods). At intermediate Dll1 expression levels (with 80 ng/ml 4-epiTc), isolated N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells showed clear activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right; Video 1). As expected for a cell-autonomous process, Notch activity, estimated by the peak rate of Citrine production, was uncorrelated with proximity to neighboring N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the activity depended strongly on ligand expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, this dependence was non-monotonic, peaking at intermediate levels of Dll1 induction, but returning to baseline at high ligand levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, Dll1 induction levels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>). This suppression of Notch activity is consistent with the previously described phenomenon of <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Celis and Bray 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>; del &#x00C1;lamo, Rouault, and Schweisguth 2011). These results suggest that Notch1 can be activated by intermediate concentrations of <italic>cis</italic>-Dll1, but that this <italic>cis</italic>-activation is dominated or replaced by <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition at high ligand concentrations.</p>
<p>We next asked how the strength of <italic>cis</italic>-activation compared to that of <italic>trans</italic>-activation, by analyzing the effect of intercellular contact on signaling levels. To control intercellular contact, we varied the fraction (relative density) of N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells in the co-culture, using wild-type CHO-K1 cells to maintain a constant total cell density. In order to increase the throughput of the experiment, we used flow cytometry to measure activation levels after 24 hours of culture (see Materials and methods). Total activation levels, which reflect a combination of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-signaling, displayed a non-monotonic dependence on ligand expression for all N1D1&#x002B;Rfng fractions, similar to <italic>cis</italic>-activation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B, cf</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The peak amplitude of total activation was &#x007E;3-fold higher than <italic>cis</italic>-activation at high cell densities, but <italic>cis</italic>- and total signaling peaked at the same ligand concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results are consistent with overall Notch activation reflecting contributions from both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions, both of which depend similarly on ligand concentration</p>
<p>In principle, <italic>cis</italic>-activation could be an artifact of the chimeric Notch1ECD-Gal4 receptor. To test this possibility, we analyzed cells co-expressing Dll1 and the wild-type Notch1 receptor (N1<sup>WT</sup>). For readout, we used a previously characterized 12xCSL-H2B-Citrine reporter gene, which can be activated by cleaved NICD through multimerized CSL binding sites in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A</xref>, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>). In the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay, these &#x2018;N1<sup>WT</sup>D1&#x002B;Rfng&#x2019; cells showed <italic>cis</italic>-activation and non-monotonic dependence on ligand levels, similar to the responses described above for the N1ECD-Gal4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A</xref>, right panel). These results indicate that <italic>cis</italic>-activation occurs for wild-type as well as engineered receptors.</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether <italic>cis</italic>-activation occurs in other cell types. We turned to the mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Owens, Smith, and Hackett 1974</xref>), knocking out the endogenously expressed Notch2 and Jagged1 genes using CRISPR-Cas9 (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3B</xref>), and adding an inducible Dll1, constitutive Rfng, and a Notch1 reporter system similar to the one used in our CHO-K1 cells, but with a different Dll1 induction system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3C</xref>). To ensure proper apical localization in these polarized cells, we also attached the ankyrin (ANK) domain of NICD to the Notch1ECD-Gal4 protein (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3D</xref>). When analyzed in the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay, isolated NMuMG N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells showed Notch activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3E</xref>, Video 2). This activation increased with ligand expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1- figure supplement 3F</xref>), indicating that epithelial NMuMG cells also display <italic>cis</italic>-activation.</p>
<p>To test whether <italic>cis</italic>-activation occurs with endogenous ligands and receptors, we next analyzed a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2, in which Notch signaling is known to regulate proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">S&#x00E4;&#x00E4;f et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dahan et al. 2011</xref>). We measured endogenous Notch activity in these cells by transfecting them with the 12xCSL-H2B-Citrine reporter construct (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A</xref>). To analyze <italic>cis</italic>-activation, we plated the transfected cells sparsely, with or without treatment with the Notch inhibitor DAPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dovey et al. 2001</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). After 24 hours, cells treated with DAPT displayed lower levels of Notch activation compared to untreated cells, suggesting that these cells can <italic>cis</italic>-activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1-figure supplement 4A</xref>). The level of <italic>cis</italic>-activation appeared similar to activation levels in cells plated at high density (<italic>cis</italic> &#x002B; <italic>trans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1-figure supplement 4B</xref>, Materials and Methods), indicating that the magnitude of <italic>cis</italic>-signaling is comparable to that shown at higher densities.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results demonstrate that <italic>cis</italic>-activation is a general phenomenon in Notch signaling, occurring in diverse cell types. In cells co-expressing Notch1, Dll1, and R-Fringe, <italic>cis</italic>-activation strength depends on ligand concentration, and is non-monotonic in CHO cells, where <italic>cis</italic>-activation peaks at intermediate ligand concentrations, but is replaced by <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition at the highest ligand levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A, C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cis-activation changes with ligand-receptor affinity</title>
<p>The affinity of ligand-receptor interactions is affected by the identities of the ligand and receptor, and co-expression of glycosyltransferases like Rfng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Moloney et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Taylor et al. 2014</xref>). We next asked how these factors impact <italic>cis</italic>-activation, starting with Rfng, which is known to increase Notch1-Dll1 signaling. We compared the N1D1&#x002B;Rfng line to its parental line (&#x2018;N1D1&#x2019;), which lacks ectopic Rfng but is otherwise identical. N1D1 cells also showed ligand-dependent <italic>cis</italic>-activation, but at reduced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Non-monotonicity was preserved, with <italic>cis</italic>-activation dominating at intermediate Dll1 concentrations, and <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition dominating at high Dll1 concentrations. Further, extending the analysis of Notch activation to increased intercellular contact, we observed a similar dependence on cell fraction and Dll1 expression with and without Rfng, with the two states differing in signal amplitude but not the shape of the ligand response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results show that Rfng increases the amplitude of both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> signaling without affecting the overall dependence of signaling on Dll1 expression level.</p>

<p>We next analyzed how the identity of the ligand affects <italic>cis</italic>-activation. Compared to Dll1, the ligand Dll4 has increased affinity for Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andrawes et al. 2013</xref>). We engineered CHO-K1 cells to stably express either an inducible Dll4-T2A-H2B-mCherry or Dll1-T2A-H2B-mCherry, along with a constitutive Notch1ECD-Gal4 Notch reporter system. To enable direct comparison, we performed the <italic>cis</italic>-activation analysis on polyclonal populations for the two cell lines. Compared to the Dll1-expressing cells, Dll4-expressing cells showed enhanced <italic>cis</italic>-activation and <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition, exhibiting greater peak reporter activity at intermediate ligand expression levels but comparable activity at the highest ligand expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Adding Rfng to the N1D4 cells did not further increase <italic>cis</italic>-activation or <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with the idea that Rfng does not increase Dll4-Notch1 affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Taylor et al. 2014</xref>). Together, these data suggest that stronger ligand-receptor interactions, achieved either through the addition of Rfng or through the use of a stronger affinity Notch ligand like Dll4, can enhance both <italic>cis</italic>-activation and inhibition.</p>

<title>Notch2 shows stronger <italic>cis</italic>-activation but decreased <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition compared to Notch1</title>
<p>To investigate whether <italic>cis</italic>-activation occurs with other Notch receptors, we engineered CHO-K1 cells to express a similar reporter system for Notch2 activation (Notch2ECD-Gal4) along with inducible Dll1- or Dll4-T2A-H2B-mCherry, as described previously. Both N2D1 and N2D4 cell populations showed a notable increase in <italic>cis</italic>-activation compared to their Notch1 counterparts, with &#x007E;3-fold higher maximal <italic>cis</italic>-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, note difference in scale compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, unlike Notch1, Notch2 showed similar levels of <italic>cis</italic>-activation by the Dll1 and Dll4 ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Strikingly, the profile of activation was monotonic, with <italic>cis</italic>-activation persisting even at the highest ligand levels tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Notch2 undergoes <italic>cis</italic>-activation, does so at a higher level than Notch1, and is not cis-inhibited as strongly as Notch1.</p>

<title>Cis-activation regulates neural stem cell maintenance and differentiation</title>
<p>We next asked whether <italic>cis</italic>-activation could play a functional role in Notch-mediated processes. As a model system, we used mouse cortical neural stem cells (NSCs), in which Notch signaling is known to regulate self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bertrand, Castro, and Guillemot 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kageyama et al. 2008</xref>). Importantly, primary NSCs can be cultured and propagated <italic>in vitro</italic> under defined media conditions and cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Daadi 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess their potential for cis-activation, we first sought to identify the Notch components expressed in NSCs. Bulk RNA sequencing showed that these cells express high levels of the receptor Notch1, the ligand Dll1, and the Lfng glycosyltransferase, and lower levels of Notch2 and Rfng, suggesting that NSCs have the potential to <italic>cis</italic>-activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>, Materials and methods). To identify suitable gene targets for assaying Notch activation, we next analyzed the expression of the <italic>Hes/Hey</italic> genes, with or without treatment with the Notch inhibitor DAPT for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Since NSC culture conditions include treatment with the EGF and FGF growth factors, and there is evidence for crosstalk between the growth factors and Notch signaling pathways in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguirre, Rubio, and Gallo 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nagao, Sugimori, and Nakafuku 2007</xref>), we compared Notch activation with or without the Notch inhibitor DAPT (10&#x03BC;M), under both reduced (0.5 ng/ml EGF, no FGF) and normal (20 ng/ml EGF, 20 ng/ml FGF) growth factor conditions (Materials and methods). Canonical Notch target genes <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hes5</italic>, and <italic>Hey1</italic> responded to Notch inhibition in these cells, and did so most strongly at reduced growth factor concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze <italic>cis</italic>-activation in NSCs, we plated them at very low density in reduced growth factor conditions (0.1 ng/ml EGF, no FGF), and cultured them with or without 10 &#x03BC;M DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Materials and methods). After 6 hours, we assayed mRNA transcript levels of Hes1, Hey1, and Hes5 in isolated cells using single-molecule HCR-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choi et al. 2010</xref>, 2018) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with Notch-induced gene expression in these isolated cells, DAPT treatment decreased mean expression levels of all three genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, cumulative histograms). Specifically, the expression levels decreased by &#x007E;2-fold for Hes1 (mean fold change 2.5, bootstrapped 95&#x0025; confidence interval [2.1, 4.1]), and Hes5 (mean 1.9, c.i. [1.3, 2.5]), and by &#x007E;25&#x0025; for Hey1 (1.2, c.i. [1.1, 1.2]). These results suggest that isolated NSCs show Notch-dependent gene expression, consistent with <italic>cis</italic>-activation.</p>

<p>We next asked whether <italic>cis</italic>-activation plays a functional role in regulating the Notch-dependent processes of NSC maintenance and differentiation. To test the effect on cell maintenance, we plated cells at low density in low growth factor conditions with or without DAPT treatment (see Materials and methods). Under these conditions, DAPT treatment dramatically decreased the number of cells after 24 hours, implying that initial cell survival depends on <italic>cis</italic>-activation (10-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, plating NSCs on recombinant Dll1ext-IgG led to a striking increase in cell numbers, further supporting a positive effect of Notch activation on cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A</xref>, Materials and methods). Together, these results suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-activation of Notch is necessary for initial NSC survival in low growth factor conditions.</p>

We estimated differentiation by immunostaining for the marker genes &#x03B2;-Tubulin and GFAP after 24 hours.

<title>Cis-activation requires cell surface interactions between ligands and receptors</title>
<p>To gain insight into where <italic>cis</italic>-activation occurs in the cell, we tested whether cell surface ligand-receptor interactions were required for productive signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Treatment of cells with soluble recombinant N1ECD-Fc (rN1ECD-Fc) receptors has been shown to prevent <italic>trans</italic>-signaling by blocking surface ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Klose et al. 2015</xref>). We first confirmed that activation levels in densely-plated N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells decreased when they were incubated in rN1ECD-Fc containing media for 24 hours, compared to IgG-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, a similar decrease in activation levels could be observed in N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells plated in the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that blocking ligand-receptor interactions at the surface reduces <italic>cis</italic>-activation. This effect was not limited to soluble receptor fragments; co-culturing a minority (5&#x0025;) of N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells with an excess of Notch1-only expressing cells similarly reduced <italic>cis</italic>-activation, and by a comparable amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further perturbed cell-surface ligand-receptor interactions by treating cells with Blebbistatin, an inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II, known to disrupt cellular adhesion and protrusions (Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shutova et al. 2012</xref>).

These results suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-activation requires surface presentation of the ligand, and is consistent with a model in which productive <italic>cis</italic> ligand-receptor interactions, like <italic>trans</italic> interactions, occur at the cell surface.</p>

<p>To determine whether interactions other than surface receptor/ligand binding could be facilitating <italic>cis</italic>-activation, we sought to measure the ability of N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells to <italic>cis</italic>- activate in a suspension culture. This enabled us to ask whether cis-activation requires interactions with the culture dish surface. For example, <italic>cis</italic>-activation could require focal adhesions formed at points of contact with the dish or result from cells depositing ligands on the culture surface, which could in turn <italic>trans</italic>-activate cell-surface receptors. To create suspension cultures, cell adhesion to the plate surface was prevented by pre-coating the surface with silicone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nienow, Hewitt, and Heathman 2016</xref>) and putting the plate on a rocker for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, Materials and methods). Under such suspension culture conditions, N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells (co-cultured with an excess of wild-type CHO-K1 cells as in the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) continued to show <italic>cis</italic>-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We note that culturing cells in suspension leads to slight reductions in cell-surface Notch1 and Dll1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-supplement 1D), which could account for the minor reduction in peak <italic>cis</italic>-activation observed in suspension cells compared to adherent cells. Nevertheless, these results suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-activation is a cell-intrinsic process and does not require extensive interactions with the culture surface.</p>
<p>Together, our results support a model in which <italic>cis</italic>-activation arises in a cell-intrinsic manner from interactions between ligands and receptors on the cell surface. More generally, the observed similarities between <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-activation in their dependence on ligand concentration and ligand-receptor affinities, and sensitivity to perturbations, could reflect a common underlying mechanism of activation.</p>

<title><italic>Cis</italic>-activation enables integration of intra- and extracellular information and negative signaling</title>
<p>Finally, we turned to the fundamental question of what types of underlying interactions could explain the observed characteristics of <italic>cis</italic>-activation, such as its non-monotonic dependence on ligand levels. We developed a series of simplified mathematical models of Notch-ligand <italic>cis</italic>-interactions at steady-state and compared their behaviors to experimental observations.</p>
<p>We first considered the simplest case of Notch (N) and Delta (D) reversibly interacting in <italic>cis</italic> to form a single activation-competent complex, denoted <italic>C<sup>&#x002B;</sup></italic>, which can subsequently undergo cleavage to release NICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, Model 0, Materials and methods).

Model 0 did not produce non-monotonic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Materials and methods), indicating that <italic>cis</italic>-activation at low ligand concentrations and <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition at high concentrations cannot both result from a single underlying type of <italic>cis</italic>-complex.</p>

<p>We next considered a more complex model in which Notch and Delta can generate two distinct types of cis-complexes, C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, with only the former competent to activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, Model 1, Materials and methods). However, analysis across diverse parameter sets showed that this model too was unable to recapitulate non-monotonic C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Materials and methods).</p>
<p>We reasoned that preferential formation of active C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and inactive C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> at lower and higher Delta production rates, respectively, could in principle result from a sequential process of <italic>cis</italic>-complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For instance, C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> could be formed from <italic>C<sup>&#x002B;</sup></italic> through additional interactions of the active complex with itself (C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x002B; C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x2192; C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Model 2b), through interactions with free N and D (N &#x002B; D &#x002B; C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x2192; C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> Model 2a), or interactions with ligand (D&#x002B; C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> &#x2192; C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Model 2c). (Note that C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> has different constituents in each of these different models). Alternatively, formation of C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> might require higher-order N-D interactions than required for formation of C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. For example, C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> could require interaction of 2 ligands and 2 receptors (2N &#x002B; 2D &#x2192; C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Model 2d). Notch ligands and receptors are known to form clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bardot et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">James T. Nichols et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nandagopal et al. 2018</xref>), and each of these models is consistent with a picture in which the inactive C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> complex involves increased clustering of ligands and receptors compared to the active C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> complex. Strikingly, across the same set of parameters tested before, these models produced non-monotonic C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> profiles more frequently than Models 0 and 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). For example, Model 2c gave rise to non-monotonic behavior for over 40&#x0025; of tested parameter sets. Moreover, when the shape of the C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> profile was analyzed across parameter sets that produced non-monotonicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), Model 2c came closest to reproducing the experimentally observed cis-activation response shape, often showing nearly complete attenuation of activation at the highest Delta production rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2C</xref>). Other models often produced non-monotonic C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> profiles with more modest declines of 30-40&#x0025; at the highest ligand production rates. While this analysis does not uniquely identify a specific molecular mechanism, it suggests that multiple distinct <italic>cis</italic>-complexes are likely required to explain the observed non-monotonic responses and that this behavior could arise through several distinct modes of interaction. It is also consistent with a potential role for a clustering-based mechanism.</p>
<p>In natural tissue contexts, <italic>cis</italic>-interactions co-exist with <italic>trans</italic>-interactions. To understand how these two effects combine, we extended Model 2c to incorporate the effects of <italic>trans</italic> interactions. We assumed that <italic>trans</italic>-ligands interact with Notch to form productive <italic>trans</italic> complexes, denoted T, and do so with the same rates of formation, dissociation, and degradation as the active <italic>cis</italic>-complexes, C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). For each non-monotonic parameter set in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, we quantified the total concentration of active complexes (T&#x002B; C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) across a range of <italic>trans</italic>-Delta levels and <italic>cis</italic>-Delta production rates (see Materials and methods). Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> for one parameter set, levels of activation were typically similar in different regimes of the <italic>cis</italic>-Delta and <italic>trans</italic>-Delta matrix. For example, medium <italic>cis</italic>-Delta &#x002B; low <italic>trans</italic>-Delta and low <italic>cis</italic>-Delta &#x002B; medium <italic>trans</italic>-Delta regimes (left middle and bottom middle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) showed higher but similar activation. In this model, the cell would thus be unable to distinguish between different combinations of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> Delta based only on the total levels of activation. By contrast, the sensitivity of Notch activation to changes in <italic>cis</italic>-Delta exhibited a striking difference between these otherwise similar signaling regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). A more comprehensive analysis of sensitivity to 1.6-fold changes in <italic>cis</italic>-Delta showed that regimes of <italic>cis</italic>-Delta<italic>/trans</italic>-Delta with similar levels of Notch activation exhibited distinct sensitivities to changes in ligand expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This analysis suggests that, in principle, a cell could individually estimate the levels of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> ligand by comparing Notch activation levels before and after a change in <italic>cis</italic>-Delta expression. It will be interesting to see if such a dynamic mechanism is utilized naturally.</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether <italic>cis</italic>-activation, by establishing an elevated basal level of Notch activity, could expand the kinds of <italic>trans</italic>-signaling modes that are possible in the Notch system. Jagged1 has been shown to form inactive <italic>trans</italic> complexes with Notch receptors glycosylated by Lfng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shimizu et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Moloney et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">LeBon et al. 2014</xref>). To test the effects of such <italic>trans</italic>-inhibitory interactions in the context of <italic>cis</italic>-activation, we extended Model 2c by incorporating an inactive <italic>trans</italic> complex, T-, and analyzed the dependence of Notch activity on the concentration of <italic>trans</italic> ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, K</xref>, Materials and methods). Interestingly, at <italic>cis</italic>-Delta expression levels that produce peak <italic>cis</italic>-activation, the presence of an inhibitory <italic>trans</italic>-ligand led to strong, dose-dependent decreases in Notch activity across multiple parameter sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). This effect results from <italic>trans</italic>-ligands effectively removing the pool of Notch receptors available to <italic>cis</italic>-activate. In this way, <italic>cis</italic>-activation could enable a &#x2018;negative&#x2019; mode of intercellular Notch signaling, where exposure to unproductive or weak extracellular ligands reduces signal in the cell. This negative mode of Notch signaling would complement the standard activating mode in much the same way that repressors complement activators in gene regulation.</p>

Typically, autocrine signaling occurs when molecules (e.g. hormones) released from a cell bind to and activate receptors on the cell from which they were synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Leibiger et al. 2012</xref>). However, autocrine signaling can also occur from membrane anchored molecules located on the same cell. For example, <italic>cis</italic>-activation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) help induce neurite outgrowth during neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sonderegger and Rathjen 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>While autocrine signaling occurs in other pathways, it has only been minimally explored in the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Formosa-Jordan and Iba&#x00F1;es 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hsieh and Lo 2012</xref>). One reason for this may be that the previously characterized inhibitory cis-interactions could appear to rule out cis-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">LeBon et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miller, Lyons, and Herman 2009</xref>). Additionally, it can be difficult to disentangle <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-activation in the context of a tissue or an <italic>in vitro</italic> system where <italic>cis</italic>-ligands and <italic>trans</italic>-ligands are simultaneously present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eddison, Le Roux, and Lewis 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hartman, Reh, and Bermingham-McDonogh 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Daudet and Lewis 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>). To address these issues, we analyzed <italic>cis</italic>-activation in spatially isolated cells engineered with a Notch reporter system that allows tunable control of ligand expression. This assay demonstrated <italic>cis</italic>-activation of the receptors Notch1 and Notch2 by the ligands Dll1 and Dll4. We also detected <italic>cis</italic>-activation across multiple cell types using both engineered and endogenous Notch components, suggesting that <italic>cis</italic>-activation is a general phenomenon in Notch signaling. Strikingly, our study not only revealed that <italic>cis</italic>-activation can co-exist with <italic>trans</italic>-activation, but showed that <italic>cis</italic>-activation behaves similarly to <italic>trans</italic>-activation and, for Notch1, depends non-monotonically on ligand concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-activation is a core part of Notch signaling.</p>
<p>With the establishment of <italic>cis</italic>-activation, we next asked what developmental role <italic>cis</italic>-activation could play. Since Notch signaling promotes self-renewal and maintenance of stem cell fate in many systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Imayoshi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Semerci et al. 2017</xref>), we chose to look at <italic>cis</italic>-activation in NSCs. We observed that survival of single isolated NSCs decreased significantly through inhibition of Notch signaling by DAPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that <italic>cis</italic>-activation can control NSC survival. Thus, self-renewing cells can be self-reliant, providing their own Notch signaling. This finding could help to explain how isolated stem cells can regenerate a complex tissue, as occurs in Lgr5&#x002B; intestinal crypt organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sato et al. 2009</xref>) and mammary gland regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stingl et al. 2006</xref>), both of which are Notch-dependent.</p>
<p>Further expanding the functional possibilities for <italic>cis</italic>-activation, our modeling results suggest ways that <italic>cis</italic>-activation could widen the capabilities of the Notch pathway using only existing components. First, we showed how <italic>cis</italic>-activation could enable a &#x201C;negative&#x201D; Notch signaling modality in the presence of <italic>trans</italic>-ligand. At <italic>cis</italic>-Delta expression levels that produce high <italic>cis</italic>-activation, the introduction of an inhibitory <italic>trans</italic>-ligand led to strong, dose-dependent decreases in Notch activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). This type of negative regulation is complementary to the <italic>trans</italic>-inhibition mechanism shown by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Benedito et al. 2009</xref>) where Notch1 activation by Dll4 was shown to be inhibited by the <italic>trans</italic>-ligand Jag1 during angiogenesis and in cell culture. Secondly, the model shows that using a combination of <italic>cis</italic>-activation, <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition, and <italic>trans</italic>-activation could in principle enable the cell to discriminate between the levels of its own (<italic>cis</italic>) ligands from those of its neighbors (<italic>trans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This property could be relevant for Notch-dependent fine-grained pattern formation through lateral inhibition circuits, in which cells coordinate their own Notch component levels with those of their neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Collier et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barad et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sprinzak et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Formosa-Jordan and Iba&#x00F1;es 2014b</xref>). More generally, the combination of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> signaling can produce interesting behaviors. For example, in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, autocrine and juxtacrine signaling modes lead to different biological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Raab and Klagsbrun 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Singh, Sugimoto, and Harris 2007</xref>). Similarly, in yeast, rewiring of the mating pathway to create an autocrine signaling system revealed that qualitatively different behaviors ranging from quorum sensing to bimodality could be generated by tuning the relative strengths of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Youk and Lim 2014</xref>). Looking forward, it will be interesting to see how Notch <italic>cis</italic>-activation and <italic>trans</italic>-inhibition mechanisms combine in natural developmental contexts.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, it remains puzzling how <italic>cis</italic> interactions could lead to both activation and inhibition in a ligand concentration-dependent fashion. Our study found that Notch ligand and receptor at the cell surface appears necessary both for productive <italic>cis</italic>-signaling and productive <italic>trans</italic>-signaling, and thus appears to be distinct from <italic>cis</italic>-interactions previously reported to occur within cellular endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Coumailleau et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">F&#x00FC;rthauer and Gonz&#x00E1;lez-Gait&#x00E1;n 2009</xref>). Along with our observations that <italic>cis</italic>-and <italic>trans</italic>-signaling also share a similar dependence on ligand-receptor affinity and ligand concentrations, these results suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-activating complexes may resemble their <italic>trans</italic>-activating counterparts. Structural studies have shown that ligand-receptor binding could occur in both parallel and anti-parallel orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cordle et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luca et al. 2015</xref>). It will therefore be interesting to see whether ligand-receptor complexes in different orientations can activate in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Mathematical modeling enabled us to explore different ways in which <italic>cis</italic>-activation and <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition could coexist. Critically, the simplest models in which the composition of activating and inhibitory complexes are identical cannot reproduce the shift from <italic>cis</italic>-activation to <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, Model 1). However, models in which the two complexes differ in their composition could more easily generate observed behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, Model 2b-d)). These results suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-activation and <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition may involve the formation of distinct types of complexes. For example, one possibility is that <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition may involve the formation of larger ligand-receptor clusters than those involved in <italic>cis</italic>-activation.</p>
<p>The establishment of <italic>cis</italic>-activation as a prominent mode of signaling by the Notch pathway adds to our knowledge of how cells use Notch to communicate with itself and its neighbors, and suggests new ways in which cells can integrate different types of Notch signals. A more complete analysis of the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions among all ligand-receptor pairs, and for different levels of Fringe expression, could help to develop a more predictive understanding of how cells with distinct component combinations would be expected to activate both in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>, thereby explaining how they use Notch to regulate their activities and those of their neighbors.</p>

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p>The majority of constructs used in this study have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>). Briefly, the reporter for wild-type Notch activation was constructed from the 12xCSL plasmid (kind gift from U. Lendahl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hansson et al. 2006</xref>), while the UAS reporter for Notch1ECD-Gal4 receptor activation was a kind gift from S. Fraser (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Celis, Bray, and Garcia-Bellido 1997</xref>). The construct containing the full-length human wild-type Notch1 sequence was a kind gift from J. Aster (de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Celis and Bray 1997</xref>). The Notch1ECD-Gal4 plasmid was generated by replacing the Notch1ICD with amino acids 1&#x2013;147 and 768&#x2013;881 of the yeast Gal4. This construct was further modified by incorporating the sequence of the ankyrin (ANK) domain from Notch1ICD (amino acids 1872-2144) 3&#x2019; to the Gal4 sequence for use in the construction of the NMuMG cell lines. Design of the Notch2ECD-Gal4 plasmid was done in a manner similar to that of the Notch1ECD-Gal4 plasmid, but with incorporation of the expression cassette into a PiggyBac vector (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) for efficient transfer to the cellular genome (Note: Notch1ECD-Gal4 was also incorporated into a PiggyBac vector when used in side-by-side comparisons with Notch2). The Notch ligand containing plasmids were based on the Tet-inducible system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For the wild-type Notch1 cell line, we constructed a plasmid containing an inducible rat Dll1 coding sequence fused to the mCherry protein sequence. All other ligand plasmids were constructed containing an inducible human Dll1 or Dll4 coding sequence fused to a viral 2A sequence that allows for co-translation of a downstream H2B-mCherry protein sequence. In the NMuMG cells and in the CHO cell populations, the ligand plasmids were constructed within a PiggyBac vector. The Radical Fringe (Rfng) constructs used were based on those described by Lebon et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">LeBon et al. 2014</xref>). For use in CHO-K1 cells, Rfng was cloned into a pLenti expression construct from the ViraPower Lentiviral Expression System (Thermo Fisher Scientific), modified with a CMV promoter and a puromycin resistance gene. For use with the NMuMG cells, Rfng was cloned into an insulated UAS reporter construct (UAS surrounded by 2 copies of the 2xHS4 insulating element) by adding a separate cassette containing the sequence for the blastomycin resistance gene followed by a viral 2A sequence connected to the sequence for the rTetR gene fused to a HDAC4-2A-Rfng sequence. rTetR-HDAC4 (rTetS) was used to suppress constitutive Notch ligand expression in the NMuMG cells with the addition of Doxycycline to the cell media. The pCS-H2B-Cerulean plasmid was described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sprinzak et al. 2010</xref>). All cloning was done using standard molecular biology cloning techniques.</p>

Then, DNA amplifiers, designed to detect bound probes and coupled to one of three Alexa Fluor dyes (488, 546, or 647), were added to the sample, and amplification allowed to proceed at room temperature for &#x007E;50 min. Samples were then washed in high salt solution (5x SSC with Tween), and stained with DAPI, prior to imaging.</p>

<p>Custom MATLAB (2015a, Mathworks) software was used to semi-automatically segment cells based on autofluorescence in the 488 channel. mRNA transcripts typically appeared as 3-5 voxel-wide high-intensity dots in the images. Previously used MATLAB software for detecting dots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Frieda et al. 2017</xref>) was adapted to automatically detect dots in images based on user-defined thresholds. For direct comparison, the same thresholds were applied to data from DAPT-treated and untreated samples.</p>

<title>Cis-activation and relative density assays</title>
<p>CHO-K1 engineered cell lines were pre-incubated with 1uM of the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and various concentrations of the tetracycline analog, 4-epiTetracycline (4-epiTc, Sigma-Aldrich) 48 hours prior to the setup of assays. For the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay, cells were washed to remove DAPT, counted, and plated sparsely at 5K cells per 24-well plate, surrounded by 150K wild-type CHO-K1 cells. 4-epiTc was added back into the media (0, 20, 35, 50, 80, or 200 ng/ml) and the cells were either incubated at 37&#x00B0;C, 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> for &#x003C;24 hours before analysis by flow cytometry or imaged using time-lapse microscopy. For the &#x2018;control&#x2019; <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay, 4K 4-epiTc pre-induced N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells were plated along with 4K N1 receiver cells (no ligand present), and 750K CHO-K1 cells per 6-well plate. Cells were analyzed for activation by flow cytometry as previously mentioned. Relative density assays were performed using the same setup conditions as the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay, but with varying ratios of engineered:wild-type cells plated. Keeping total cell numbers at 150K cells per 24-well plate, either 5K, 10K, 25K, 50K, 75K or 100K engineered cells were plated along with wild-type CHO-K1 cells. For the <italic>cis</italic>-activation and relative density assays using Blebbistatin treated cells, assay setup was done exactly as mentioned above but with the addition of 10 uM (&#x00B1;)-Blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich) added to the cell media at the time of plating.</p>
<p>For NMuMG cells, cis-activation and density assays were performed just like those with CHO-K1 cells. However, cells were pre-incubated in 10 uM DAPT with or without the addition of 1 ug/ml or 10 ug/ml Doxycycline (Takara Bio USA Inc.) for 3 days in order to decrease ligand expression levels prior to assay setup. Cells were plated with or without Dox, with the addition of 100 ng/ml Dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) for each assay.</p>
<p>Caco-2 cells were pre-incubated with 100 uM DAPT for 1 day prior to transfection. 24 hours post-12xCSL reporter transfection, the cells were washed, counted and plated sparsely at 3.5K cells in a 24-well plate for the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay or 7-fold more dense at 3.5K cells in a 96-well plate for a density assay with or without the addition of DAPT. &#x003C;24 hours after plating, cells were analyzed by FLOW cytometry.</p>

<sec id="s6o3">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Custom MATLAB code (2013a, MathWorks) was used to segment cell nuclei in images based on constitutive Cerulean fluorescence. Briefly, the segmentation procedure uses built-in edge detection MATLAB functions and adaptive thresholds to detect nuclear segments. Nuclear segments were then matched in pairs of images corresponding to consecutive time frames, and thus tracked through the duration of the movie. Single-cell tracks were subsequently curated manually to correct for errors in segmentation/tracking. Fluorescence data was extracted from nuclear segments by calculating the integrated fluorescence within the segment and subtracting a background fluorescence level estimated from the local neighborhood of the segment. This fluorescence was linearly interpolated across time frames where nuclei could not be segmented automatically. Division events were detected automatically, and fluorescence traces were corrected for cell division by adding back fluorescence lost to sister cells. The resulting &#x2018;continuized&#x2019; traces were smoothed and the difference in fluorescence between consecutive time frames was calculated. A smoothed version of this difference was used as an estimate of production rate of the fluorescent protein.</p>

<title>Models</title>
<p>The models analyzed here attempt to recapitulate the behavior of the system at steady state. Components of the system include free Notch receptor (N) and free Delta ligand (D) and, depending on the model, cis- and trans complexes (C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and T, respectively) between ligands and receptors. In all models, N and D are produced at a rate of &#x03B1;<sub>N</sub> and &#x03B1;<sub>D</sub>, and degraded at the rate of &#x03B3;<sub>N</sub> and &#x03B3;<sub>D</sub>, respectively.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>I)</label><p><bold>Model 0</bold>. This model assumes that N and D interact at a rate <italic>k</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> to produce a single type of cis-complex, C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, which dissociates at a rate <italic>k<sup>&#x2212;</sup></italic>, and is degraded at a rate &#x03B3;<sub>C&#x002B;</sub>.

This model assumes that N and D can interact to produce two distinct <italic>cis</italic>-complexes, active C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and inactive C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. These complexes are formed through similar second-order interactions between N and D, occurring with different rate coefficients. They similarly dissociate and degrade at different rates, and cannot interconvert.

However, in these models, C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> requires C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> for its formation (a-c) or the stoichiometry of inactive C<sup>&#x2212;</sup> formation is higher than that of C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (d).

<p>Model 0 contains 6 parameters (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="313171_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>), while Models 1 and 2 contain 3 additional parameters (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="313171_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>). Using the built-in <italic>lhsdesign</italic> function in MATLAB (2015a, Mathworks), the Latin Hypercube Sampling algorithm was applied to pick 10,000 parameters, each in the range 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup>. For each parameter set, the model was simulated for each of 10 values of <italic>&#x03B1;<sub>D</sub></italic>, logarithmically spanning a 100-fold range around the sampled value of &#x03B1;<sub><italic>N</italic></sub>. The <italic>fsolve</italic> function, with initial conditions [<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="313171_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>] for N, D, C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, C<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, respectively, was used to numerically approximate the steady state solution for each parameter set.</p>
<p>For each solution, the following features of the <italic>&#x03B1;<sub>D</sub></italic> vs. C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> profile were calculated: the relative value of <italic>&#x03B1;<sub>D</sub></italic> at which C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> was maximum (&#x2018;C-max&#x2019;), and the fractional increases in C-max relative to its value at the lowest and highest values of <italic>&#x03B1;<sub>D</sub></italic>. Parameters that produced C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> profiles that peaked between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> value of <italic>&#x03B1;<sub>D</sub></italic> were deemed to be non-monotonic.</p>
<p>For the <italic>trans</italic>-interaction model, first the values of D<sub>cis</sub> obtained at D<sub><italic>trans</italic></sub> &#x003D; 0 were calculated for each parameter set. For subsequent simulations, the values of D<sub><italic>trans</italic></sub> were chosen to be the same as that of these D<sub><italic>cis</italic></sub> values, i.e., D<sub><italic>cis</italic></sub> produced in the absence of <italic>trans</italic>-ligand.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>No statistical method was used to determine sample sizes. The sample sizes used were based on general standards accepted by the field. The number of replicates used for each experimental analysis is listed in the figure legends. All replicates are biological replicates, corresponding to measurements performed on distinct biological samples, as opposed to performing the same tests multiple times on a single sample (technical replicates). <italic>P</italic>-values for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> were calculated using the two-sided KS-test. All pairwise comparisons between samples fulfilled the criterion n1&#x002A;n2/(n1 &#x002B; n2) &#x2265; 4, where n1 and n2 represent the number of data points in two samples. Under this condition, the KS-statistic is greater than twice the inverse of the Kolmogorov statistic, and the calculated <italic>P</italic>-value is accurate. The non-parametric nature of the KS-test obviates the need to make assumptions regarding the shape of the distributions being compared. <italic>P</italic>-values for Caco-2 cell measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 1-figure supplement 4</xref>) and CHO cell surface binding assay measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) were calculated using the one-sided Student T-test, which assumes that random error in the measurement follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution.</p>

<title>Cis-activation occurs with the wild-type Notch1 receptor and in multiple cell types.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> (<italic>Left</italic>) The N1<sup>WT</sup>D1&#x002B;Rfng cell line (schematic). CHO-K1 cells were engineered to express the wild-type Notch1 receptor (&#x2018;N1<sup>WT</sup>&#x2019;, green), an H2B-Citrine reporter (yellow) activated by cleaved NICD through 12 multimerized CSL binding sites in the promoter region (orange), and a Dll1-mCherry protein (red), from a 4-epiTc inducible promoter. Constructs for constitutive expression of Rfng (purple) and H2B-Cerulean (&#x2018;H2B-Cer&#x2019;, blue) were also stably integrated into these cells. (<italic>Right</italic>) Flow cytometry analysis of the mean activation of N1<sup>WT</sup>D1&#x002B;Rfng cells in the <italic>cis</italic>-activation assay. Note non-monotonic dependence of activation on ligand levels, qualitatively similar to that observed for N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which contain the chimeric N1ECD-Gal4 receptor. <bold>(B)</bold> (<italic>Left</italic>) Antibody staining levels, relative to unstained controls, for endogenous Notch2 receptor and Jagged1 ligand in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG. (<italic>Right</italic>) Staining for endogenous Notch2 and Jagged1 after CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-out (Materials and methods). Levels of the receptor and ligand decrease to background levels. <bold>(C)</bold> Schematic of the NMuMG N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cell line. NMUMG<sup>N2J1KO</sup> cells (panel B, right side) were engineered to express a chimeric receptor combining the Notch1 extracellular domain (&#x2018;N1ECD&#x2019;, green) with the Gal4 transcription factor (orange) in place of the endogenous intracellular domain, and fused to the Ankyrin domain of the Notch1ICD (ANK, blue). When activated, Gal4-ANK is released and enables activation of a stably integrated fluorescent H2B-Citrine reporter gene (yellow) through UAS sites (brown) on the promoter. Cells also contain a stably integrated construct expressing Dll1 (red) with a co-translational (T2A, white) H2B-mCherry readout (red), from a Tet-off promoter. A constitutively expressed rTetR-HDAC4 (&#x2018;rTetS&#x2019;) gene (pink) suppresses expression of the Dll1-T2A-H2B-mCherry cassette in the presence of doxycyline (&#x2018;Dox&#x2019;). Rfng (purple) is expressed co-translationally with rTetS. Cells also constitutively express H2B-Cerulean (&#x2018;H2B-Cer&#x2019;, blue). <bold>(D)</bold> Representative images showing surface staining (green) of N1ECD-Gal4 (<italic>left</italic>) or N1ECD-Gal4-ANK (<italic>right</italic>) receptors in NMuMG cells (gray overlay shows DIC channel).

<title>Surface perturbations affect N1D1&#x002B;Rfng <italic>cis</italic>-activation</title>
<p>(A) (<italic>Left</italic>) Schematic showing how recombinant N1ECD-Fc protein (rN1ECD-Fc) affects <italic>trans</italic>-activation between cells expressing ligands (red) and receptors (green). rN1ECD-Fc protein, present in excess, binds to surface ligands and prevents their interactions with receptors on neighboring cells. This is expected to reduce overall Notch activation in cells relative to the control (cells incubated with IgG protein). (<italic>Right</italic>) Comparison of mean Notch activation in N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells incubated with rNotch1ECD-Fc receptors (magenta) and those that were incubated with IgG (black) for 24 hours (see Materials and methods). Cells were plated densely to allow <italic>trans</italic>-activation and analyzed by flow cytometry &#x003C;24 hours post-plating. Error bars represent s.e.m (n&#x003D;3 biological replicate experiments). <bold>(B)</bold> (<italic>Left</italic>) Schematic of N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells co-cultured with CHO-K1 cells (top) or Notch1 cells (&#x2018;N1-only cells&#x2019;) that express receptor but no ligand. Notch1 cells can bind to the Dll1 ligand on the N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells and block it from interacting with Notch1 on the same cell. If surface interactions are necessary for <italic>cis</italic>-activation, this will lead to a decrease in Notch activation. (<italic>Right</italic>) Comparison of mean Notch activation in N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells co-cultured with an excess (95&#x0025; of culture) of CHO-K1 cells (black) or N1-only cells (magenta). Error bars represent s.e.m (n&#x003D;3 biological replicate experiments). <bold>(C)</bold> Mean Notch activation in N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells co-cultured at low (mostly <italic>cis</italic>-activation, &#x2018;Cis-only&#x2019;) or high (<italic>cis&#x002B;trans</italic>-activation, &#x2018;Cis &#x002B; trans&#x2019;) relative density with CHO-K1 cells and treated with 10 &#x03BC;M Blebbistatin (Materials and methods). Data is shown as a fold-change relative to control untreated samples plated similarly. Error bars represent s.e.m (n&#x003D;3 biological replicate experiments). <bold>(D)</bold> Compared to adherent culture (blue), suspension culture (magenta) of N1D1&#x002B;Rfng cells results in a slight decrease in cell-surface levels of mean Dll1 (<italic>left</italic>) and Notch1 (<italic>right</italic>), measured by immunostaining (see Materials and methods). Error bars represent s.e.m (n&#x003D;3 biological replicate experiments).</p>

<title>Latin Hypercube Sampling generates evenly distributed parameters</title>
<p>Scatter plots showing pairwise distributions of parameters tested in Models 1 and 2a-d. For clarity, each plot only shows 3000 parameter pairs, randomly subsampled from the 10,000 total parameters sets analyzed. Orange dots are subsampled from parameters that produce non-monotonic C<sup>&#x002B;</sup> profiles in Model 2c, while the blue dots are subsampled from the complete set of analyzed parameters. Note the even distribution of parameters across sampled space in each plot.</p>
