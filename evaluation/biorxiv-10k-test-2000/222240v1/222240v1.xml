<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a widespread, intracellular symbiont of arthropods, able to induce reproductive distortions and antiviral protection in insects. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can also be pathogenic, as is the case with <italic>w</italic>MelPop, a virulent variant of the endosymbiont of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. An extensive genomic amplification of the 20kb region encompassing eight <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes, called Octomom, is responsible for <italic>w</italic>MelPop virulence. The Octomom copy number in <italic>w</italic>MelPop can be highly variable between individual <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies, even when comparing siblings arising from a single female. Moreover, Octomom copy number can change rapidly between generations. These data suggest an intra-host variability in Octomom copy number between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cells. Since <italic>w</italic>MelPop <italic>Wolbachia</italic> with different Octomom copy numbers grow at different rates, we hypothesized that selection could act on this intra-host variability. Here we tested if total Octomom copy number changes during the lifespan of individual <italic>Drosophila</italic> hosts, revealing selection for different <italic>Wolbachia</italic> populations. We performed a time course analysis of Octomom amplification in flies whose mothers were controlled for Octomom copy number. We show that despite the Octomom copy number being relatively stable it increases slightly throughout <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adult life. This indicates that there is selection acting on the intra-host variation in the Octomom copy number over the lifespan of individual hosts. This within host selection for faster replicating bacteria symbionts may be in conflict with between host selection against highly pathogenic <italic>Wolbachia</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene copy number variation is one of the mechanisms allowing rapid evolution across the tree of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In bacteria, growth inhibition by nutrient limitation or antibiotic presence may be overcome by increasing copy number of genes functionally related to these challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Moreover, amplified genomic regions allow accumulation of mutations without the risk of loss of the original function. This can lead to the generation of more beneficial variants and subsequent loss of extra copies or repurposing of the new copies for a new function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Thus, genomic amplifications generate extensive and reversible genetic variation, which can either increase the fitness of an individual directly or be a substrate on which adaptive evolution can act.</p>
<p>We have previously found that a genomic amplification affects the biology of the intracellular, maternally transmitted bacterium <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a widespread endosymbiont of insects, causing an array of phenotypes, including reproductive manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] and antiviral protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Moreover, some <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains can strongly reduce the host lifespan. This was first described for <italic>w</italic>MelPop, a laboratory <italic>Wolbachia</italic> variant, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The Octomom genomic region, which contains eight <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes, is amplified in <italic>w</italic>MelPop, while it is present as a single copy in closely related non-pathogenic <italic>Wolbachia</italic> variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The number of copies of this region varies greatly between individual <italic>w</italic>MelPop-infected flies from the same population, ranging from two to ten copies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. We have previously established <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines carrying defined and different Octomom copy numbers and observed that the higher the Octomom copy number, the higher <italic>Wolbachia</italic> levels and the shorter the lifespan of its <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Moreover, a <italic>w</italic>MelPop that reverted to carrying only one Octomom copy proliferates at the same rate as the control <italic>w</italic>MelCS&#x005F;b variant and is not pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Thus, we identified Octomom copy number as a pathogenicity determinant of <italic>w</italic>MelPop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The high variation in Octomom copy numbers between individual flies can also be observed in the progeny of single <italic>w</italic>MelPop-carrying females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This variation between siblings could be explained by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> variation within a female and differential symbiont assortment to the progeny. The fact that the variability decreased under selection argues for initial high variation within single flies, which is pruned over a few generations of selection for either the highest or the lowest Octomom copy number. However, even under constant selection some variation was either maintained or continuously generated, since reversing the direction of the selection or relaxing it could rapidly change the Octomom copy numbers in these lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>We hypothesized that variation in Octomom copy number between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cells within an individual host could lead to a differential growth of these cells. If <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cells with higher Octomom copy number proliferate more, their frequency in the pool of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> within a host will increases over time, and the average Octomom copy number of the within-host population increases over the host lifespan. We tested this hypothesis through a time course analysis of Octomom copy number in individual <italic>w</italic>MelPop flies originating from mothers with controlled Octomom copy number.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We examined the stability of Octomom copy number over the adult life (from eclosion to the onset of high mortality) in single <italic>w</italic>MelPop-carrying <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). The flies were the offspring of parents carrying <italic>w</italic>MelPop with low Octomom copy number (median of 4.5 Octomom copies, range from 4 to 5.5) or high Octomom copy number (median of 9.5, range from 8.5 to 11.5). The low Octomom cohort had, on average, 5.45 (standard deviation, SD &#x003D; 0.82) Octomom copies per genome and the high Octomom cohort had an average of 10.29 (SD &#x003D; 1.90) Octomom copies per genome. The fitted generalized additive model (GAM) clearly shows an increase in Octomom copy number in the first few days (six to eight days), which subsequently levels off at the later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A and B</xref>). The trend is highly significant (the smooth term for time, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001). This shows that Octomom copy number in the <italic>w</italic>MelPop population increases during most of the adult host lifespan.</p>

<p>In parallel, we tested <italic>Wolbachia</italic> titer in the same flies. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> levels increase with the age of flies (log-linear mixed-effect model (lme), <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001) and flies carrying <italic>w</italic>MelPop with higher Octomom copy numbers have 1.85 times higher <italic>Wolbachia</italic> levels compared to flies carrying <italic>w</italic>MelPop with lower Octomom copy numbers (lme, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001), confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). However, we do not see a significant interaction between cohort and growth rate (lme, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.102). We also tested if Octomom copy number could be an explanatory variable for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> levels within each cohort. This variable was not significant (lme, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.48).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By analyzing cohorts of individuals from mothers carrying <italic>Wolbachia</italic> with controlled Octomom copy number we observed that Octomom copy number is relatively stable over the life of the host. However, we detected a small, but clear and statistically significant, increase in Octomom copy number over time in the first six to eight days of the adult <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> life. This could be explained by selection acting on the heterogeneity of <italic>w</italic>MelPop copy number between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cells within a single host. Since bacteria with higher copy numbers grow faster over time, they contribute more to the total pool of <italic>w</italic>MelPop in an older fly and therefore increase total Octomom copy number. In our dataset, the Octomom copy number stops increasing at the last days of the host life. This is surprising and could be explained by the initial heterogeneity in the flies being reduced in the course of selection. If <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cells with the maximal Octomom copy number within each fly reach a very high frequency or are fixed, there is no genetic variation for selection to act on, and the Octomom copy number does not continue to increase. Alternatively, the differential fitness between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> harboring different Octomom copy numbers may decrease with the age of the fly, weakening the strength of the selection and preventing continuous Octomom copy number growth.</p>
<p>Importantly, our data indicate that the selective pressures acting on <italic>w</italic>MelPop within and between hosts are different. Within a host, there may be a selection for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that grow fast. On the other hand, competition between flies could select for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that grow slower and have a lower cost for the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. These opposing selective pressures may play a role in shaping the evolution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in natural populations.</p>
<p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> with higher Octomom copy number proliferate more and are more pathogenic to their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The within host selection for bacteria that proliferate more and have a higher potential of being deleterious to the host may be a common phenomenon. For instance, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> variants that cause blood or deep tissue infection are, in the majority, the result of within-host selection from non-pathogenic nose colonizing variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The adaptations conferring high virulence identified in this study do not favor <italic>S. aureus</italic> dissemination and onward transmission (discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]). Thus, the selective pressure acting on the bacteria within a single host may be in conflict with the selective pressure acting on the entire bacterial population. This implies that although the more pathogenic bacterial variants arise throughout the life of the hosts, they are constantly purged from the overall bacterial population by selection either on the fitness of the host (vertically transmitted symbionts) or on the bacterial transmission capacity (horizontally transmitted symbionts).</p>
<p>A recent report suggested that <italic>w</italic>MelPop Octomom copy numbers change drastically during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lifespan, increasing more than two-fold in the first ten days of adult life and then decreasing more than four-fold over the next thirty days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. These results differ from the ones we present here and may be explained by the lack of experimental control for the Octomom copy number in these flies. Using data from Chrostek and Teixeira 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] we constructed a model showing that in a mixed population of flies the differential growth of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> with different Octomom copy numbers, combined with differential death of flies carrying <italic>Wolbachia</italic> with different Octomom copy numbers, leads to initial increase in Octomom copy number, followed by a decrease due to death of the flies carrying <italic>Wolbachia</italic> with higher Octomom copy number, at the host population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we confirmed that <italic>w</italic>MelPop with higher Octomom copy number has higher <italic>Wolbachia</italic> titers, supporting our conclusion that this amplification controls <italic>w</italic>MelPop levels. However, the difference in growth rate between these lines was not statistically significant. This may be due to the high variability in the data and the differential growth between these lines being potentially small. We have previously shown different growth rates between <italic>w</italic>MelPop carrying one and two copies of Octomom and between these and <italic>w</italic>MelPop carrying 12 or 15 copies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, the growth rate of <italic>w</italic>MelPop carrying 12 and 15 copies was not significantly different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This indicates that the relationship between growth rate and Octomom copy number is not linear and that differences in <italic>w</italic>MelPop carrying higher copy numbers may have a smaller impact on growth. Therefore, the difference in growth between <italic>w</italic>MelPop carrying five and ten copies may indeed be small. The difference in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> titers despite the lack of measurable difference in the growth rate might be the result of the cumulative effect of small growth rate differences throughout the fly development from egg to adult, the result of a differential growth rate at different development stages, or even the accumulation of small differences in growth for more than one generation.</p>
<p>Although the results present here are compatible with our prediction based on within host heterogeneity and selection, alternative explanations exist. For example, the increase in Octomom copy number with time could reflect an intrinsic property of these duplications independent of selection. Nonetheless, this would also result in an increase in more pathogenic <italic>w</italic>MelPop with host age and an outcome at odds with the selective pressure at the inter-host level. Future approaches may try to relate the rate of change of Octomom copy number within host in different conditions that affect the amplification-induced phenotype. For example, at lower temperatures the phenotype of <italic>w</italic>MelPop is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and the selection for <italic>w</italic>MelPop with higher Octomom copy number may be absent.</p>
<p>The labile nature of the Octomom amplification and the resulting phenotypes of this amplification make <italic>w</italic>MelPop an interesting case study to understand genome dynamics and selective forces acting on endosymbionts. This system may be further used in the future to reveal general principles in host-bacteria symbiosis.</p>

<title>DNA extractions</title>
<p>DNA was extracted from single flies (<italic>w</italic>MelPop) or pools of ten flies (<italic>w</italic>MelCS&#x005F;b controls). Each fly or pool of flies was squashed in 250 &#x03BC;l of 0.1 M Tris HCl, 0.1 M EDTA, and 1&#x0025; SDS (pH 9.0) and incubated 30 min at 70&#x00B0;C. Next, 35 &#x03BC;l of 8 M CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>K was added, and samples were mixed by shaking and incubated on ice for 30 min. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4&#x00B0;C, and the supernatant was diluted 100&#x00D7; for qPCR.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title>
<p>The real-time qPCR reactions were performed using CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Each reaction contained 6 &#x03BC;l of iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.5 &#x03BC;l of each primer (3.6 mM), and 5 &#x03BC;l of diluted DNA. We performed two technical replicates for each sample for each set of primers. Primer sequences were described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. For all three genes assayed: <italic>Wolbachia WD0513</italic> and <italic>wsp</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila Rpl32</italic> the following thermal cycling protocol was applied: 2 min at 50&#x00B0;C, 10 min at 95&#x00B0;C, and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95&#x00B0;C, 1 min at 59&#x00B0;C, and 30 s at 72&#x00B0;C. Melting curves were examined to confirm the specificity of amplified products. Ct values were obtained using Bio-Rad CFX Manager software with default threshold settings. Ct values were subjected to a quality check - samples with standard deviation between technical replicates exceeding 0.5 for one of the genes were discarded. The experiment spanned six qPCR plates and three samples of ten wMelCS&#x005F;b flies (extracted and aliquoted beforehand and assayed on every qPCR plate) were used to normalize between plates. Relative amounts of genes were calculated by the Pfaffl method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. To apply the method, the efficiency of each primer set was predetermined in a separate experiment. For relative Octomom copy number quantification, <italic>WD0513</italic> was the target gene and the single-copy <italic>wsp</italic> gene was used as a reference. The medians of three samples of pools of ten wMelCS&#x005F;b flies were used as control values for the Pfaffl method. <italic>w</italic>MelCS&#x005F;b has one copy of the Octomom region in the genome, determined by the coverage analysis of sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This sample, with known Octomom copy number, is required to estimate Octomom copy number of the remaining samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. For <italic>Wolbachia</italic> quantification, <italic>wsp</italic> was the target gene and <italic>Drosophila Rpl32</italic> gene was used as a reference. The levels of <italic>wsp</italic> are relative to the median of the samples of the low Octomom cohort at time zero.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The statistical analysis was performed in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The script of the analysis is provided in S1 Text. Graphs were generated using the package ggplot2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Since the temporal trend over time of the number of Octomom copies was not linear we analyse it by fitting a Generalized Additive Model (GAM, package mgcv in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]). We included time and line as independent variables and PCR plate as a random effect. The smooth terms for the interaction between time and lines were non-significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x003E; 0.114) and were removed form the final model.</p>
<p>Analysis of <italic>wsp</italic> levels over time was performed with log-linear mixed-effect model fits (package lme4 in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]). The effect of interaction between factors was determined by an ANOVA comparing models fit to the data with and without the interaction.</p>
