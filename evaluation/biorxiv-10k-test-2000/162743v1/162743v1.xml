<title>Abstract</title>
<p>It is widely accepted that cAMP regulates gene transcription principally by activating the protein kinase A (PKA)-targeted transcription factors. Here, we show that cAMP enhances the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in multiple cell types. 5hmC is converted from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases, for which Fe(II) is an essential cofactor. The promotion of 5hmC was mediated by a prompt increase of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP). cAMP enhanced the acidification of endosomes for Fe(II) release to the LIP likely through RapGEF2. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was confirmed by adenylate cyclase activators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and most notably by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The transcriptomic changes caused by cAMP occurred in concert with 5hmC elevation in differentially transcribed genes. Collectively, these data show a previously unrecognized regulation of gene transcription by GPCR-cAMP signaling through augmentation of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool and DNA demethylation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyclic AMP (cAMP), the second messenger, converts the binding of ligands with many different G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs, also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors) into various biological activities (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sutherland, 1970</xref></italic>). Principally, cAMP exerts its function through three major targets <italic>-</italic> cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs), and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac). It is well known that cAMP has an impact on gene transcription, which is currently considered to be mediated by the PKA-targeted transcription factors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Montminy, 1997</xref></italic>). Three transcription factors, including cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), cAMP response element modulator (CREM), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), can be phosphorylated by PKA and subsequently bind to cAMP response elements (CRE) in gene promoters, generally to activate gene transcription (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sands and Palmer, 2008</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Schwann cells form the myelin sheath of axons within the peripheral nervous system. cAMP is a known instructive signal for Schwann cell differentiation into a myelinating phenotype (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jessen et al., 1991</xref></italic>). cAMP directly induces cell cycle arrest along with the expression of a wide variety of myelination-associated genes such as <italic>Egr2/Krox20</italic>, a transcription factor that is considered a master regulator of the myelin program, and myelin protein zero, the main peripheral nerve myelin protein (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bacallao and Monje, 2015</xref></italic>). However, the mechanism by which cAMP regulates transcription and promotes the differentiation of Schwann cells is not fully understood.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is one major epigenetic mark that regulates gene transcription. Active DNA demethylation is catalyzed by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenases, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kriaucionis and Heintz 2009</xref></italic>), and further to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ito et al., 2011</xref></italic>). 5fC and 5caC are ultimately replaced by unmodified cytosine (5C) to complete cytosine demethylation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pastor et al., 2013</xref></italic>). It is noteworthy that 5hmC is also a unique epigenetic mark with regulatory capacities in addition to being a DNA demethylation intermediate (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shen et al., 2014</xref></italic>). Tet belongs to the iron and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG, alternatively known as <italic>a</italic>-ketoglutarate)-dependent dioxygenase family which utilizes labile Fe(II) as a cofactor and 2OG as a co-substrate. We and others have shown that ascorbate, which has the capacity to reduce the redox-inactive Fe(III)/Fe(IV) to Fe(II), is another cofactor for Tet (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Minor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blaschke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dickson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2013</xref></italic>). Thus, ascorbate has an impact on DNA demethylation by promoting the availability of redox-active Fe(II) to Tet. 5mC and 5hmC are major epigenetic marks that govern both cell identity and cellular phenotype transformation. Thus, it is plausible that such marks are involved in the transition of Schwann cells from the immature to myelinating phenotype.</p>
<p>Similar to cAMP, ascorbate was identified as another essential factor for Schwann cells to initiate and promote myelin formation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bunge et al., 1986</xref></italic>). Intracellular ascorbate deficiency can cause hypomyelination in modeled rodents (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gess et al., 2011</xref></italic>). It is plausible that, by regulating DNA demethylation, ascorbate alters the cellular phenotype of Schwann cells towards a myelinating state. Based on this shared function in enhancing Schwann cell myelination, we reasoned that cAMP, like ascorbate, might also play a role in Tet-mediated DNA demethylation. Here, we investigated the potential role of cAMP in DNA demethylation. We identified that cAMP enhanced the generation of 5hmC in cultured Schwann cells. The effect of cAMP on 5hmC was not limited to Schwann cells but is likely a general effect, as it has been verified in other cell types. cAMP promptly increased the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP) independently of major cAMP targets but likely through RapGEF2 to enhance the acidification of endosomes and subsequently elevate the LIP. The increase of labile Fe(II) could mediate the effect of cAMP on 5hmC. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was mimicked by the addition of AC activators and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as caffeine. Stimulation of Schwann cells with isoproterenol or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), two ligands known to increase intracellular cAMP through Gs-coupled receptors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 1995</xref></italic>), elevated levels of intracellular labile Fe(II) and 5hmC. Furthermore, stimulation with cAMP caused a genome-wide shift in 5hmC profile, which correlated with a majority of the differentially expressed transcripts in Schwann cells.</p>

<title>cAMP promotes 5hmC generation</title>
<p>In the absence of cAMP treatment, 5hmC was barely detectable by dot blot in primary cultured rat Schwann cells. However, after treatment with membrane-permeable cAMP (100 &#x03BC;M), 5hmC signal emerged at comparable levels to cells treated with ascorbate (50 &#x03BC;M, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Encouraged by this initial observation, we investigated the role of cAMP on 5hmC by immunofluorescence (IF). The addition of cAMP (0 &#x2013; 250 &#x03BC;M) dose-dependently increased 5hmC generation in Schwann cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The IF signal for 5hmC was sustained for 1 &#x2013; 7 days upon continuous cAMP (100 &#x03BC;M) treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), suggesting that continuous cAMP treatment largely maintained 5hmC. An enhanced generation of 5hmC was also verified in other cell types examined, such as HEK-293 cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, indicating that the effect of cAMP on 5hmC is not limited to Schwann cells and is likely to be a general effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>We next tested whether the elevation of endogenous cAMP imparts a similar effect as exogenously applied cAMP. Treating cells with forskolin, which directly activates transmembrane adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce endogenous cAMP, promoted 5hmC generation in Schwann cells as did bicarbonate, an activator of soluble AC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). The production of 5hmC was also observed when cells were treated with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors caffeine or IBMX, both of which prevent cAMP degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Conversely, no 5hmC signal was observed after cells were treated with AMP (100 &#x03BC;M) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that endogenous cAMP is indeed involved in 5hmC generation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>cAMP increases the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool to generate 5hmC</title>
<p>To understand how cAMP enhances 5hmC generation, we first examined the transcription of <italic>Tet</italic>. mRNA levels of <italic>Tet2</italic> and <italic>Tet3</italic> were decreased, whereas <italic>Tet1</italic> mRNA remained unchanged after treatment with cAMP (100 &#x03BC;M) for 1 day (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 <italic>-figure supplement 1</italic></xref> and <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table"><italic>table supplement 1</italic></xref>), a time point at which cAMP clearly promoted 5hmC generation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Thus, the increased level of 5hmC does not appear to be mediated by an effect of cAMP on the expression of <italic>Tet</italic>. In healthy cells such as primary cultured Schwann cells, the most plausible rate-limiting factor for Tet&#x2019;s enzymatic activity is the replenishment of the Fe(II) cofactor rather than 2OG, a relatively abundant intermediate of the Krebs cycle. We thus hypothesized that cAMP may increase access to bioavailable Fe(II), as does ascorbate. To test this hypothesis, we used Trx-Puro (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Spangler et al., 2016</xref></italic>), a recently developed reactivity-based probe that is highly specific for redox&#x2013;active labile Fe(II) within the cell. Reaction of Trx-Puro with labile Fe(II) unmasks the aminonucleoside puromycin through a Fenton-type reaction. Released puromycin is incorporated in cellular proteomes, which can be visualized using a convenient IF assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Spangler et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment with cAMP at a dose as low as 1 &#x03BC;M increased intracellular labile Fe(II), which reached even higher levels after treatment with 10 <italic>-</italic> 100 &#x03BC;M cAMP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Incubation of the cells with Diox-Puro (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Spangler et al., 2016</xref></italic>), a dioxolane control conjugate that is non-peroxidic, showed no IF signal after cAMP treatment indicating the Fe(II) dependence of the signal detected by Trx-Puro (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 <italic>-figure supplement 1</italic></xref>). The action of cAMP on intracellular labile Fe(II) was rapid. Fe(II) signal appeared within 2 hours (the minimal time for simultaneous incubation of cAMP and Trx-Puro) and peaked at 4 hours after cAMP treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and 2D). Similar to 5hmC, the effect of cAMP on intracellular labile Fe(II) was also validated in other types of cells including HEK-293, MEF, and SH-SY5Y (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that it is likely a general effect.</p>

<p>Treatment with AMP had no observable effect on labile Fe(II) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

Ascorbate at physiological levels has been shown to have no obvious influence on intracellular labile Fe(II) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Spangler et al., 2016</xref></italic>). Indeed, no obvious change in the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool was observed in Schwann cells after treatment with ascorbate at a physiological concentration (50 mM) (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 <italic>-figure supplement 1</italic></xref>), suggesting that ascorbate may only increase the bioavailability of Fe(II) to Tet and other enzymes locally.</p>

<p>To determine whether cAMP promotes 5hmC generation via labile Fe(II), Schwann cells were treated with two different iron chelators 2,2, bipyridyl (20 &#x03BC;M) and deferoxamine (20 &#x03BC;M) prior to cAMP stimulation. These iron chelators drastically decreased the level of labile Fe(II), and further abolished the effect of cAMP on 5hmC in Schwann cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The abolishing effect of the iron chelators on cAMP-induced 5hmC generation was also verified in other cells such as human melanoma A2058 cells (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 <italic>-figure supplement 2</italic></xref>). These results suggest that cAMP upregulates 5hmC by elevating the intracellular labile Fe(II).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>cAMP increases the intracellular labile Fe(II) by enhancing endosome acidification</title>
<p>The molecular mechanism by which cAMP alters labile iron in principle could be related to iron uptake and storage in the cell. Cellular uptake of iron is a complicated cascade involving the internalization of transferrin-transferrin receptor complex and Fe(III) discharge from transferrin after the acidification of endosomes, via vacuolar H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase, the H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pump). Subsequently, Fe(III) is converted to Fe(II) by Steap3 and leaves the endosome via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) to enter the LIP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">De Domenico et al., 2008</xref></italic>). One key step in the iron uptake is endosome acidification. cAMP treatment consistently decreased the pH in endocytotic vesicles as measured using vesicle pH indicator that emits increasing levels of fluorescence as pH decreases from 8 to 4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest that cAMP enhances the acidification of endosome, which could underlie the elevated LIP.</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 4.</label>
<caption><p>cAMP increases labile Fe(II) and 5hmC by enhancing the acidification of endosomes. (<bold>A</bold>) cAMP (100 &#x03BC;M) treatment decreases the pH in intracellular vesicles.

(<bold>B</bold>) V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (200 nM) pretreatment for 30 min blocks the effect of cAMP on both labile Fe(II) and 5hmC in Schwann cells. Scale bar = 20 &#x03BC;m (n = 3 independent experiments with 3 biological replicates each).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="162743_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We then tested whether elevated labile Fe(II) and 5hmC by cAMP signaling is mediated by enhanced endosome acidification. Cells were pretreated with V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (200 nM). Indeed, Bafilomycin A1 largely abolished the effect of cAMP on labile Fe(II) as well as 5hmC in the cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, knocking down the expression of ferritin did not block the induction of labile Fe(II) elevation by cAMP indicating that iron storage may not be a major target of cAMP signaling (<xref rid="fig4S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 <italic>-figure supplement 1</italic></xref>). Overall, these results suggest that cAMP signaling upregulates the LIP, and subsequently 5hmC generation by acidifying the endosome.</p>
<p>In an attempt to understand how cAMP signaling causes endosome acidification, we examined the major known targets of cAMP, which include PKA, CNGCs, and Epac. PKA phosphorylates substrate proteins and Epac acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G protein Rap20. CNGCs are nonselective cation channels for Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, Ca<sup>&#x002B;&#x002B;</sup>, and other cations, but have no known role in transporting iron. To determine whether labile Fe(II) depends on the major known signaling targets of cAMP, we pretreated the cells with PKA inhibitors (KT5720, H89), an Epac inhibitor (ESI09) or a CNGC channel blocker (LCD). Neither the inhibitors nor the channel blocker prevented the observable alterations in labile Fe(II) in cAMP-treated Schwann cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, we confirmed that H89 (20 &#x03BC;M) and KT5720 (2 mM) indeed abolished the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of Peptag peptide which is catalyzed by PKA, thus confirming the potency of the two PKA inhibitors (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 <italic>-figure supplement 1</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the transcripts of CNGC and Epac (<italic>RapGEF3, RapGEF4</italic>) were expressed at either null or extremely low levels in control and cAMP-treated Schwann cells (<xref rid="tbl5S1" ref-type="table">Figure 5 <italic>-table supplement 1</italic></xref>), suggesting that the impact of CNGC and Epac on intracellular labile Fe(II) is likely to be negligible. These results suggest that the upregulation of intracellular labile Fe(II) by cAMP is likely independent of these known pathways.</p>
<p>Although the transcription of Epac1 (<italic>RapGEF3</italic>) and Epac2 (<italic>RapGEF4)</italic> is very low, other <italic>RapGEFs</italic>, especially <italic>RapGEF2</italic> transcripts are expressed at a much higher level (&#x003E; 330 fold of Epac1 or Epac2) in Schwann cells. RapGEF2 appears to be also a target of cAMP, which could be further involved in the activation of other small GTPases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pak et al., 2002</xref></italic>). To explore whether RapGEF2 mediates the elevation of labile Fe(II) via endosome acidification, we used siRNA to knockdown its expression. Due to the low transfection efficiency of primary cultured Schwann cells, we alternatively used HEK-293 cells, which also showed a robust elevation of labile Fe(II) and 5hmC in response to cAMP treatment. In scramble siRNA treated cells, cAMP treatment decreased the pH value in endocytic vesicles and elevated the intracellular labile Fe(II). However, after the expression of RapGEF2 was reduced by siRNA, the effect of cAMP on endosome acidification and labile Fe(II) was largely abolished (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The knockdown effect of siRNA on RapGEF2 was confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig5S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 &#x2013; <italic>figure supplement 2</italic></xref>). These results suggest that cAMP signaling, via RapGEF2, acidifies the endosome to augment the LIP.</p>

<title>Activation of Gs-coupled receptors increases intracellular labile Fe(II) and 5hmC</title>
<p>Signaling of many GPCRs either up-or downregulates intracellular cAMP, depending on the coupled Gs or Gi. It was shown that isoproterenol and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) elevate cAMP in Schwann cells by binding to &#x03B2;-adrenergic receptors and CGRP receptors respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 1995</xref></italic>), both of which are coupled with Gs. We therefore used these two GPCRs as models to test whether their signaling can change DNA demethylation. Indeed, stimulation with isoproterenol or CGRP increased 5hmC in Schwann cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), which correlated with an elevated level of intracellular labile Fe(II) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>Currently, it is thought that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of three transcription factors including cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), cAMP response element modulator (CREM), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) are responsible for the transcriptional changes caused by cAMP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sands and Palmer, 2008</xref></italic>). However, 3,965 transcripts (56.5&#x0025; of total differential transcripts) might be targeted by the three transcription factors after reviewing ChIP data in ENCODE and ChEA databases (<italic>Yip et al</italic>., 2012; <italic>Lachmann et al.</italic>, 2010). Of the 3,965 transcripts, 2,372 transcripts were also accompanied with differential 5hmC peaks, suggesting that these genes might be dually regulated by 5hmC and the transcription factors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Additionally, 24.2&#x0025; of differentially transcribed genes have differential 5hmC peaks but have not been previously shown to be targeted by CREB, CREM, or ATF1. For example, cAMP dramatically induced the transcription of <italic>Egr2</italic> (also known as <italic>Krox-20</italic>), which plays a key role in Schwann cell myelination (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2011</xref></italic>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is known that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, reflect the interface of a dynamic extracellular microenvironment and the genome. However, the specific signaling molecules that serve as mediators between environmental variation and epigenomic changes remains largely elusive. On the other hand, GPCRs, the largest and most diverse group of membrane receptors, sense extracellular changes by binding with specific ligands. Signaling of cAMP, one major second messenger of the GPCRs, and its targets has been thoroughly studied and was thought to be well established. Our results show a previously unknown pathway of GPCR-cAMP signaling in promoting the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool, enhancing DNA demethylation and consequently changing gene transcription.</p>
<p>The convergence of 5hmC generation and labile Fe(II) concentrations suggests a previously unrecognized role for labile Fe(II) in propagating a signal initiated by cAMP and mediated by the Fe(II)-dependent oxidase activity of Tet. This new role for iron is a plausible one given that cellular iron uptake and the shuttling of iron from storage in ferritin as Fe(III) to its entry into the cytosolic labile pool of Fe(II) is a fundamental aspect of cellular iron metabolism. While this process is clearly involved in maintaining iron homeostasis and the biosynthesis of Fe(II) cofactors, it appears also to have been appropriated for cellular signaling in the particular case of enzymes that employ labile Fe(II) as an essential co-factor, such as the iron and 2OG-dependent Tet and Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylases. The changes to labile cytosolic Fe(II) measured by Trx-Puro likely also reflect the nuclear Fe(II) pool, since there is a rapid equilibrium between these two Fe(II) pools, presumably via nuclear pores (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ma et al., 2015</xref></italic>). Thus, the results described above suggest that cAMP increases the accessibility of Fe(II) to Tet by augmenting labile Fe(II) in the cytosol and nucleus.</p>
<p>An increase in labile Fe(II) can be induced by cAMP in as little as 2 hours, indicating that no new protein synthesis is required. The molecular mechanism by which cAMP alters labile Fe(II) appears to be related to iron uptake rather than storage. Cellular iron uptake is a multistep process including internalization of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex, vesicle formation, endosome acidification, Fe(III) discharge, conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II). and release of Fe(II) from the endosome to the LIP. cAMP could potentially be involved in each step of iron uptake. Our results suggest that cAMP signaling increases the acidification of endocytotic vesicles, which is essential for Fe(III) discharge from the internalized transferrin. This is consistent with earlier studies showing that cholera and pertussis toxins, by increasing intracellular cAMP, enhance endosome acidification (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Van Dyke. 1997</xref></italic>). It could be that cAMP signaling increased the number and/or activity of V-ATPase to pump H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> into the endosome to release Fe(II) to the LIP, which subsequently promotes 5hmC generation. Indeed, we showed that inhibitors of V-ATPase largely abolish the effect of cAMP on labile Fe(II) and 5hmC.</p>
<p>The elevation of labile Fe(II) by cAMP signaling appears independent of the major targets of cAMP including PKA, Epac, and CNGC. We examined the effect of RapGEF2 initially based on its higher expression level in Schwann cells. cAMP failed to induce labile Fe(II) and 5hmC once the expression of RapGEF2 was reduced, suggesting that RapGEF2 could be at least one major mediators of cAMP to regulate labile Fe(II) and 5hmC. Thus, it is plausible that RapGEF2, directly or indirectly, affects the number and/or activity of V-ATPase in the endosome. Future studies are warranted to investigate how RapGEF2 regulates the function of V-ATPase.</p>
<p>Both cAMP and ascorbate appear to enhance the activity of Tet to generate 5hmC. However, the mechanisms of cAMP and ascorbate in promoting the availability of Fe(II) to Tet are likely different. Ascorbate at physiological concentrations has no obvious influence on intracellular labile Fe(II) shown here and before (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Spangler et al., 2016</xref></italic>), but is thought to maintain local iron in the active form of Fe(II) for Tet as it does for other hydroxylases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mandl et al., 2009</xref></italic>). In contrast, cAMP elevates the global intracellular labile Fe(II) pool.</p>
<p>For the first time, GPCRs via cAMP are directly linked to epigenetic regulation. The first hint of a possible role for cAMP in DNA demethylation came from studies on Schwann cells. Using Schwann cells as a model, we showed that intracellular cAMP elevation increased the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool, changed genome-wide 5hmC profile, and altered the transcription of many genes. More importantly, activation of different Gs-coupled receptors demonstrated increases in intracellular labile Fe(II) and 5hmC similarly to treatments that elevate intracellular cAMP including membrane permeable cAMP, AC activators, or PDE inhibitors. Coupled with Gs, Gi, or both, GPCRs can raise or decrease the intracellular cAMP, which will further change DNA methylation-demethylation dynamics. Thus, GPCRs via cAMP transduce microenvironmental cues to epigenetic alterations.</p>
<p>One recent study showed that cAMP has an impact on DNA methylation by mainly increasing the expression of Tet or DNA methyltransferases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fang et al., 2015</xref></italic>). This may not be a general effect but more likely a cell specific effect since we observed a decreased expression of Tet2 and Tet3 in Schwann cells after cAMP treatment.</p>
<p>In this study, most experiments were conducted in Schwann cells. However, the effect of cAMP on 5hmC is not limited to Schwann cells and is likely a general effect, as it has been verified in other cell types. Studies have shown that 5hmC is not only a demethylation intermediate but also a unique epigenetic mark that regulates transcription by recruiting a different set of binding proteins compared to 5mC (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref></italic>). Indeed, altered 5hmC profiles caused by cAMP correlated with a majority of differentially transcribed genes. Thus, cAMP regulates the transcriptome by enhancing DNA demethylation, in addition to the known pathway of PKA-targeted transcription factors. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis suggests that some differential transcripts correlate with either 5hmC or the three transcription factors, while other transcripts correlate with both or none of them. The focus of this study is to link the dots from GPCR to cAMP, Fe(II), 5hmC, and ultimately transcription. Future studies can dissect the impact of cAMP on the transcriptome and the contribution of 5hmC and/or the three transcription factors in different cell types.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show a novel function of cAMP signaling in regulating DNA demethylation by increasing the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool likely via a non-canonical pathway, which consequently promotes the oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC by Fe(II)-dependent Tet. Dynamic intracellular cAMP, regulated by Gs-/Gi-coupled receptors and factors affecting AC/PDE directly, therefore could have a profound impact on the epigenome.</p>

<title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from cultured Schwann cells using RNeasy kits from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). A nanodrop 8000 photospectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to quantify RNA. The qScript Flex cDNA kit from Quanta Biosciences (Beverly, MA) was used for reverse transcription (RT) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in triplicate on a QuantStudio 12K Flex using the PowerUp Sybr Green Master Mix from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Primers were designed to span introns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><italic>3/4table supplement 1</italic>). The transcript amplification results were analyzed with the QuantStudio 12K Flex software, and all values were normalized to the levels of the <italic>Sdha</italic> using the 2<sup>&#x2212;(&#x0394;&#x0394;Ct)</sup> method.

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNEasy Mini Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). A Bioanalyzer 2000 was used to measure the quality of RNA. All samples&#x2019; RNA integrity numbers (RIN) were above 9. Whole transcriptome sequencing (also known as RNA-seq) was carried out at the Sequencing Core of John P. Hussman Institute of Human Genomics at the University of Miami using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA). RNA-seq was performed with 3 replicates per group to give &#x007E;89&#x0025; power to detect a 1.5-fold change between and a standard deviation of 14.5&#x0025; of the mean. This standard deviation was calculated from actual data used for analysis. Briefly, after ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was depleted, sequencing libraries were ligated with standard Illumina adaptors and subsequently sequenced on a Hiseq2000 sequencing system (125 bp paired-end reads, 4 samples per lane; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). All samples after sequencing had between 39,094,152 and 54,392,564 reads. Raw read data was first run through quality control metrics using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Reads were trimmed with trim_galore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>) to remove low quality bases from reads (scores &#x003C;20 in Phred &#x002B; 33 format) and Illumina adapters. After quality control was checked and trimming performed, sequence reads were aligned to the rat transcriptome (Rnor_6.0, Ensembl.org), quantified using the STAR aligner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref></italic>), and normalized using CuffQuant and CuffNorm, which are part of the Tuxedo Suite (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>).</italic> All samples had between 37,714,718 and 52,162,956 aligned reads. Statistical significance was determined using 3 alternative differential expression calculators: edgeR, DESeq2, and CuffDiff (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref></italic>). To reduce false positives, differentially expressed features were determined by cutoff adjusted <italic>P</italic> values of 0.05 across all 3 methods (false discovery rate, FDR). DESeq2 called 8,589 differential transcripts, edgeR called 8,029 differential transcripts, and CuffDiff called 8,076 differential transcripts with a total of 7,020 transcripts called as differential by all three programs. Of the 7,020 transcripts, 3,809 transcripts increase in expression and 3,211 transcripts decrease after treatment with cAMP. Differential transcripts were visualized using z-scores per transcript where blue represents lower expression and red represents higher expression in the form of a heatmap generated using the heatmap.2 function of gplots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html</ext-link>).</p>

<title>hMeDIP-seq</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from Schwann cells using QIAamp DNA mini kits from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. A Qubit Fluorometer from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify the concentration of DNA. A Bioanalyzer 2000 was used to measure the quality of DNA. DNA was submitted for hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) at the Epigenomics Core at the University of Michigan (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mohn et al., 2009</xref></italic>). hMeDIP-seq was performed with 3 replicates per group to give &#x007E;98&#x0025; power to detect a 2-fold change between groups and a standard deviation of 19&#x0025; of the mean. This standard deviation was calculated from actual data used for analysis. Briefly, DNA is sonicated to approximately 100 bp and then ligated with Illumina adaptors. A portion of the DNA was set aside for sequencing as unprecipitated input DNA and the remaining DNA was incubated overnight at 4&#x02DA;C with an antibody against 5hmC from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The antibodies, along with immunoprecipitated DNA, were then pulled out of solution using Protein G magnetic beads from Invitrogen, (Carlsbad, CA). Magnetic beads were then washed with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 with 140 mM NaCl and 0.05&#x0025; triton x-100). The beads were then resuspended in proteinase K buffer and incubated for 3 hours at 55&#x02DA;C to remove the antibodies from the DNA. Unprecipitated input DNA was incubated with proteinase K buffer alongside the precipitated DNA. After proteinase K treatment, DNA was purified using AMPure beads from Beckman Coulter (Brea, California). Efficiency of immunoprecipitation was evaluated using the 5hmC, 5mC, cytosine DNA standard pack from Diagenode (Searing, Belgium). DNA was then sequenced on a HiSeq4000 sequencing system (50 bp single-end reads, 3 samples per lane; Illumina, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitated samples all had between 123,192,512 and 143,992,231 reads and unprecipitated input samples all had between 84,030,758 and 142,427,775 reads.</p>
<p>Reads were trimmed with trim_galore to remove low quality bases from reads (scores &#x003C;20 in Phred&#x002B;33 format), and Illumina adapters. After quality control was checked sequence reads were aligned to the rat genome (Rnor_6.0, Ensembl.org) using BWA (<italic>Li et al., 2009a</italic>). All immunoprecipitated samples had between 117,762,176 and 137,740,430 aligned reads and unprecipitated input samples had between 80,822,191 and 138,629,799 aligned reads. Multimapped reads were removed using Samtools (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2009b</xref></italic>) and duplicate reads were removed using PicardTools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). All precipitated samples had between 63,471,316 and 78,618,595 uniquely aligned reads and all unprecipitated input samples had between 44,195,649 and 80,394,782. To identify regions of the genome with substantial levels of 5hmC, peaks were called and filtered using the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) method developed for the ChIP-seq portion of the ENCODE project (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2011</xref></italic>). Briefly, peak calling was performed with MACS2 using the narrow peak mode and a relaxed threshold of 0.001 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang et al., 2008</xref></italic>). The number of peaks called for the control samples were 364,776, 346,424, and 331,841. The number of peaks called for the cAMP samples were 367,389, 356,223, and 351,249. Peaks were ranked from strongest to weakest peaks in each individual sample, and the rank order of common peaks among samples was compared to filter for only peaks with similar strength across all samples using the R-scripts provided for the IDR pipeline with a threshold of 0.02. After filtering for peaks in common, 106,807 peaks remained for the cAMP samples and 120,057 peaks remained for the control samples. The lower number of filtered peaks among the cAMP samples is likely a result of treatment causing higher variability in 5hmC levels in samples. When peaks across sample types were merged, a total of 192,143 peaks remained to be investigated in all samples. Reads within peak regions were quantified using HT-Seq-count (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anders et al., 2015</xref></italic>). Statistical significance was determined using edgeR as was used for RNA-seq, except without using the calcNormFactors function so as to normalize to total read counts rather than counts within peaks. This normalization was necessary to account for a global change in 5hmC levels. Differential expression was also calculated using DESeq2. To minimize false positives, we considered only peaks with a minimum of 2X fold change and below an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (false discovery rate, FDR) below 0.05 by both edgeR and DESeq2. By this method, 66,963 peaks were upregulated, and 10,026 peaks were downregulated after treatment with cAMP, and 115,154 peaks remained unchanged.</p>

<title>Integration of hMeDIP-seq and RNA-seq</title>
<p>5hmC peaks were assigned to regions of the genome using Region_analysis in the diffReps package (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shen et al., 2013</xref></italic>). Peaks whose center was within 3,000 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) of a given gene were considered promoter regions for that gene, and peaks whose center lay in the remainder of the gene or up to 1,000 bp following the transcription end site (TES) were considered gene body for that gene. Peaks outside of gene body regions and gene promoter regions were classified as intergenic. Differential transcripts, with differential peaks assigned to either the promoter region or gene body of that gene, were considered to be potentially regulated by 5hmC. Of the 7,020 differential transcripts, 4,071 (58&#x0025;) were found to be potentially regulated by 5hmC. Further, visualization of both RNA-seq and hMeDIP-seq data was done using UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>) and bigwig files showing loci of differential transcripts.</p>
<p>It is known that elevation of cAMP regulates the activity of three different transcription factors: CREB1, CREM and ATF1. The Ma&#x2019;ayan laboratory has posted analyzed data online from both the ChEA and ENCODE projects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/#downloads">http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/#downloads</ext-link>). To find genes potentially regulated by these three transcription factors, we used the ENCODE 2015 and ChEA 2015 databases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yip et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lachmann et al., 2010</xref></italic>). Experiments using rat cells are uncommon in these databases, so we combined the lists of genes found regulated by all experiments of a given transcription factor from human, mouse, or rat experiments. ATF1 was found to regulate 2,000 genes across a variety of human cells in the ENCODE projects, of which 1,996 genes were found to have a rat homolog in the Jackson Labs Complete Homology Class report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/homology.shtml">http://www.informatics.jax.org/homology.shtml</ext-link>). CREM was found to regulate 5,776 genes in mouse testicular cells (GC1-SPG) in the ChEA project, of which 5,773 were found to have a rat homolog in the Jackson Labs Complete Homology Class report. CREB1 was found to regulate 4,040 genes across human leukemia (K562) and adenocarcinoma (A549) cells in the ENCODE project, as well as 957 genes in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in the ChEA project. CREB1 was also found to regulate 2,393 genes in rat hippocampus and 3,057 genes in mouse testicular cells (GC1-SPG) in the ChEA project. Combining data from all CREB1 experiments in both ChEA and ENCODE gave 6,997 rat genes potentially regulated by CREB1. Combining results from all experiments of all three transcription factors, 9,767 genes have been found to potentially be regulated by at least one of these three transcription factors. Of the 7,020 differential transcripts, 3,965 (56.5&#x0025;) were included in the list of genes potentially regulated by one of the three transcription factors that is activated by cAMP/PKA. Differences in transcription can be possibly attributed to both transcription factors and changes in 5hmC for 2,372 (33.8&#x0025;) of the 7,020 transcripts and 1,356 (19.3&#x0025;) are not likely regulated by either transcription factor or 5hmC.</p>
