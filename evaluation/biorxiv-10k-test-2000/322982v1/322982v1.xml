<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In vertebrates, pyroptosis is an intensely inflammatory form of programmed cell death which is dependent on Caspase 1 activation and release of cytoplasmic cytokines including IL-1&#x03B2;. This death pathway is critical for controlling pathogenic infection by mobilizing immune cells and stimulating the development of adaptive immune response. In invertebrates, however, due to the lack of adaptive immune response, it is still elusive whether Caspase 1-dependent cell death pathway exists. In this study, our data showed that Caspase 1-mediated cell death was activated by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection to control the virus in shrimp. Caspase 1 had a higher expression level in hemocytes and lymphoid-like organ in shrimp and WSSV infection was significantly promoted upon the inhibition of Caspase 1 enzymatic activity. IL-1&#x03B2;-like protein was identified as the substrate of Caspase 1 and its interaction with Caspase 1 was validated ectopically and endogenously. Moreover, IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was released into extracellular contents under WSSV infection and Prophenoloxidase system was activated, resulting in the reduction of WSSV copies <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data unraveled a previously unidentified mechanism through which Caspase 1-dependent cell death controlled virus infection in shrimp. Therefore, our study opened the possibility that an invertebrate cytokine network might be operative and regulate host defenses against virus infection as in vertebrates.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The elimination of infected cells by programmed cell death is considered as one of the most important anti-pathogen responses. Pyroptosis is one form of programmed cell death, which is mediated by Caspase 1 activation. Activated Caspase 1 can process the inactive precursors of interleukin 1&#x03B2; (IL-1&#x03B2;) into mature inflammatory cytokines to induce potent immune responses. Meanwhile, pyroptosis also induces morphologic changes, DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation to destroy infected cells. However, due to the lack of efficient adaptive immune responses, it is still unclear whether Caspase 1-mediated cell death also exits and plays such an important role in defending hosts from pathogen invasion in invertebrates. In our data, Caspase 1 gene was characterized and Caspase 1-mediated cell death pathway was validated in shrimp. The Caspase 1-mediated cell death pathway was enhanced by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection to control the virus in shrimp. IL-1&#x03B2;-like protein was cleaved by Caspase 1 and released into extracellular contents under WSSV infection to activate Prophenoloxidase system, leading to the reduction of WSSV copies in shrimp in vivo. On the other hand, silencing of <italic>Caspase 1</italic> or <italic>IL-1&#x03B2;-like</italic> gene facilitated virus infection in shrimp. Our study indicated that Casapase-1-mediated cell death played an important antiviral role in shrimp against WSSV infection and opened the possibility that an invertebrate cytokine network might be operative.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most important anti-pathogen responses consists of the elimination of the infected cells by programmed cell death, a response found in all metazoans (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Apoptosis is perhaps the most widely recognized programmed cell death, and is defined by the requirement for particular cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases, commonly Caspases 3/7, which produce an orchestrated disassembly of the cell resulting in mounting more severe immune responses (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is found that apoptosis plays a very important role in determining the outcome of host-pathogen interactions (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Other than Caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis, pyroptosis is a more recently identified pathway of host cell death that is stimulated by a range of pathogen infections and non-infectious stimuli (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike apoptosis, pyroptosis occurs after Caspase 1 activation. Caspase 1 is usually activated by protein complexes termed inflammasomes in mammals (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Two types of inflammasomes formed by Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have been identified. One type is NLRC4 and murine NLRP1b and the other type is NLRP3 (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). NLRC4 and murine NLRP1b contain CARD domains that directly interact with the Caspase 1 CARD and then activate Caspase 1 proteolytic activity. In contrast, NLRP3 contains a Pyrin signaling domain instead of a CARD domain (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The Pyrin domain binds the Pyrin domain of the adaptor protein ASC which is composed of only a Pyrin and a CARD domain. ASC then recruits Caspase 1 via CARD-CARD interactions and finally activate Caspase 1 proteolytic activity (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Activated Caspase 1 can recognize and process the inactive precursors of interleukin 1&#x03B2; (IL-1&#x03B2;) into mature inflammatory cytokines, which is then secreted into intracellular contents (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). IL-1&#x03B2; is an important mediator of the inflammatory response of the host against pathogen infection (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Meanwhile, pyroptosis also induces morphologic changes, DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation to destroy infected cells (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
<p>During pathogen infection, the host benefits from pyroptosis. The compromised cells are eliminated and more severe immune responses are launched, effectively destroying the protective environment where infectious agents can thrive (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In Caspase-1-deficient macrophages where pyroptosis is compromised, higher intracellular bacterial loads are detected during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Pyroptosis also promotes pathogen clearance by acting as an alarm signal that recruits immune cells to the site of infection (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The secretion of IL-1&#x03B2; and IL-18 promotes leukocyte activation and immuno-stimulatory factors are released from lysed cells into the extracellular milieu (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A bunch of released cytosolic products are potent damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat-shock proteins and DNA-chromatin complexes. By the activation of pattern-recognition receptors, these DAMPs accelerate proinflammatory cytokine production (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). On the other hand, pathogens have evolved effector proteins capable of directly inhibiting Caspase 1 and inflammasome activation, preventing cells from pyroptosis (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Virulent <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains express the effector protein ExoU, which blocks Caspase 1 activation and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> T3SS Rho-GTPase activating protein YopE inhibits inflammasome activation (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The host-pathogen interaction mechanisms suggest that the activity of Caspase 1 leading to pyroptosis may represent an important antiviral pathway that prevents replication and spread of viruses to neighboring cells.</p>
<p>Pyroptosis is such a potent mechanism to clear intracellular pathogens. However, current studies on the role of pyroptosis in host-virus interactions has not been extensively explored and it is still unclear whether pyroptosis also exits and plays such an important role in defending hosts from pathogen invasion in invertebrates. In this study, we aim to find out whether pyroptosis is also one of the pathways that contributes to eliminating virus in invertebrate. The results revealed that the activity of Caspase 1 in shrimp was enhanced by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. The silencing of <italic>Caspase 1</italic> or <italic>IL-1&#x03B2;-like</italic> gene facilitated virus infection in shrimp. Our study indicated that Casapase-1-mediated cell death played an important antiviral role in invertebrate.</p>

<title>Involvement of Caspase 1 in the virus infection to shrimp</title>
<p>In order to investigate whether Caspase 1-mediated cell death plays a role in the immune response of invertebrates to virus infection, the profiles of <italic>Caspase 1</italic> gene was characterized in the course of shrimp immunity against WSSV infection. The sequence analysis revealed that the shrimp Caspase 1 contained caspase activity domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1a">Fig 1A</xref>). The expression of the gene in different organs was then examined by real-time PCR. The result showed that Caspase 1 expression was most significant in hemocytes followed by lymphoid-like-organ, however, we can barely detect the mRNA of Caspase 1 in muscle and heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1a">Figure 1B</xref>). The expression pattern of the gene was further confirmed by detection of protein levels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1a">Figure 1C</xref>. These results indicated the shrimp Caspase 1 might function in immunity system&#x002D;-hemocytes and lymphoid-like organ in shrimp, where fighting off invading pathogens usually took place, so the result indicated that Caspase 1 might play a role in the antiviral cellular pathway&#x002E;.</p>
<p>To explore the role of Caspase 1 in virus infection to shrimp, the expression of Caspase 1 was detected at different time points after shrimp were infected with WSSV. The results revealed that the transcriptional level of Caspase 1 was significantly upregulated with the prolonged infection time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1b">Fig 1D</xref>). Meanwhile, the protein level of the gene also showed similar expression patterns during WSSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1b">Figure 1E</xref>).Taken together, these results indicate that Caspase-1-mediated cell death is involved in virus infection of shrimp.</p>

<title>Requirement of enzymatic activity of Caspase 1 in virus infection</title>
<p>To determine whether the enzymatic activity of Caspase 1 was associated with virus infection, shrimp were challenged with increasing concentrations of WSSV and hemocytes were collected for the detection of Caspase 1 activity by incubating with the substrate Ac-YVAD-pNA. The results showed that Caspase 1 activity was greatly enhanced while more viruses were used for infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2a">Fig 2A</xref>). Moreover, Caspase 1 activity increased dramatically along with the prolonged infection time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2b">Fig 2B</xref>). These results indicated that the enzymatic activity of Caspase 1 was actually indispensible in the pathway of virus infection.</p>

<p>To explore whether the Caspase 1 activity facilitated or inhibited virus infection, Caspase 1 inhibitor Belnacasan was used in combination with WSSV injection or not, and WSSV copy number was then measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that the WSSV copy number increased significantly upon the inhibition of Caspase 1 enzymatic activity, suggesting that Caspase 1 played an antiviral role possibly conducted by its enzymatic activity.</p>

<title>Interaction between Caspase 1 and IL-1&#x03B2; like protein</title>
<p>In order to reveal the cellular pathway in which Caspase 1 participated to play an antiviral role, we performed Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to identify the substrate of Caspase 1. The Co-IP data showed that one specific band was discovered after Caspase 1-specific antibody but not IgG was used for CoIP, which was then identified as IL-1&#x03B2; like protein by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3a">Fig 3A</xref>). To further demonstrated the interaction between Caspase 1 and IL-1&#x03B2; like protein, Flag-Caspase 1 and His-IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was respectively cloned into PIZ/V5-His plasmid and co-transfected into insect High Five cells. Anti-Flag IP was performed and then proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The result indicated that His-IL like protein was actually detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3a">Fig 3B</xref>), showing the interaction between Caspase 1 and IL-1&#x03B2; like protein. Meanwhile, anti-His IP was also performed and Flag-Caspase 1 could also be found by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3b">Fig 3C</xref>). These results revealed that the two proteins could interact with each other by their expressions in insect cells.</p>
<p>To further confirm the interaction Caspase 1 and IL-1&#x03B2; like proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, endogenous IP was performed using Caspase 1 or IL-1&#x03B2; like protein antibody. The results showed that IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was detected by Caspase 1 endogenous IP and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3b">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Redistribution of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein induced by WSSV infection to activate phenoloxidase system</title>
<p>To investigate the functions of Caspase 1 and IL-1&#x03B2; like protein interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, siRNA respectively targeting <italic>Caspase 1</italic> gene and <italic>IL-1&#x03B2; like protein</italic> gene was designed.

<p>As reported in mammary cells, IL-1&#x03B2; is firstly interacted with and then cleaved by Caspase 1 before it is released into extracellular contents (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), however, in this study, it is still elusive how IL-1&#x03B2; like protein reacts upon virus infection. Therefore, the level of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein in hemocytes and the corresponding plasma before and after WSSV infection was examined. Hemolymph was collected and centrifuged to separate the hymocytes and plasma for the detection of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein. Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression level of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was increased in the plasma and decreased in hemoctes when shrimp were challenged with WSSV, indicating that IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was released into extracellular contents under virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4a">Fig 4B</xref>). In order to determine whether Caspase 1 mediated the release of IL-1 like protein, the expression of Casapse 1 was firstly knocked down by siRNA and then the expression pattern of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was examined. The results showed that the level of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein in the plasma decreased while the level in the hemocytes increased upon infection with WSSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4b">Fig 4C</xref>). These data showed that the release of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein into plasma was controlled by Caspase 1 in shrimp.</p>
<p>To further determine whether IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was required to be cleaved by Caspase 1 before releasing into extracellular contents, the enzymatic activity of Caspase 1 was inhibited by Belnacasan and then the level of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was examined. The result showed that the level of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein didn&#x2019;t increase in the plasma, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of Caspase 1 was required for the release of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein and that IL-1&#x03B2; like protein needed cleavage by Caspase 1 before releasing into extracellular contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4b">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Prophenoloxidase (PO) activating system is an important identification and defense system for eliminating viruses in crustaceans (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To find out whether Caspase 1 mediated cell death could influence PO system, Caspase 1 and IL-1&#x03B2; like protein were respectively knocked down and then the PO activity was measured with or without WSSV challenge. As expected, WSSV challenge greatly induced the PO activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4b">Fig 4D</xref>). However, either Caspase 1 knockdown or IL-1&#x03B2; like protein knockdown partially inhibited the PO activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4b">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that Caspase 1 mediated cell death could enhance PO activity upon WSSV infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The outbreak of viral diseases is a major concern preventing the development of shrimp aquaculture industry. WSSV is one of the most virulent shrimp viruses and the processes of pathogenesis are extremely complex. Due to the lack of effective therapeutics to control virus, it is of great importance to understand viral pathogenesis and host responses at the molecular level in order to prevent virus invasion. So far, some studies have demonstrated that many genes and pathways are involved in host defense against WSSV, including Ran protein, the Ras-activated endocytosis process, the RNA interference pathway and apoptosis (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Apoptosis is maybe the best described form of cell death that is mediated by the activation of the apoptotic caspase enzymes Caspase 3/7 and the antiviral role of apoptosis has been discovered both in invertebrates and vertebrates. Currently, pyroptosis, which is mediated by Caspase 1 activation, is thought to have the capacity of eliminating viruses only in vertebrates (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In vertebrates, pyroptosis activation can result in not only the production of activated inflammatory cytokines, but also rapid cell death characterized by plasma-membrane rupture and release of proinflammatory intracellular contents(<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). On the other hand, viruses including HIV have evolved mechanisms to inhibit pyroptosis, enhancing their ability to persist and cause disease (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Ultimately, it is the competition between host and pathogen to regulate pyroptosis, and the outcome dictates life or death to the host or to viruses. Based on the critical role of Caspase 1 in the defense of a wide range of virus infections in vertebrates, in this study, Caspase 1 gene was first cloned from shrimp and the activity of Caspase 1 was then characterized. Our data showed that Caspase 1 activity was upregulated upon WSSV infection and the knockdown of Caspase 1 facilitated virus infection. Compared with the function of pyroptosis in vertebrates, our study revealed that Caspase 1-mediated cell death also contributed to eliminating virus in crustacean. Our findings indicated that the antiviral function of Caspase 1 was conservative although the sophisticated immune responses of shrimp have not been developed yet.</p>
<p>In vertebrates, the activated Caspase 1 recognizes and cleaves IL-1&#x03B2; into the mature form. The release of mature IL-1&#x03B2; further enhances the inflammatory response by stimulating immune cell activation and more cytokine secretion (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), leading to critical physiological consequences such as fever and hypotension. However, the cleavage and release of IL-1&#x03B2; is not indispensible for caspase 1-mediated cell death as demonstrated by IL-1&#x03B2;-/&#x002D; knockout animals (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In our study, the substrate of Caspase 1, which was named IL-1&#x03B2; like protein, was firstly identified. The results showed that WSSV infection induced the redistribution of IL-1&#x03B2; like protein into plasma of shrimp, indicating that IL-1&#x03B2; like protein was released into extracellular contents upon virus infection. The released IL-1&#x03B2; like protein, instead of triggering inflammation responses, activated phenoloxidase system of shrimp, an important invertebrate defense mechanism against virus infection. These data demonstrated that the function IL-1&#x03B2; like protein participating in Caspase 1-mediated cell death in shrimp was similar with that in vertebrates, and that IL-1&#x03B2; like protein functioned as cytokine-like molecules in invertebrates. Although invertebrates including shrimp lack adaptive immune system, several putative functional analogues of inflammatory cytokines have been identified so far. For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like molecules and interleukin-1 (IL-1)-like molecules are detected in a variety of invertebrates, such as insects, echinoderms and protochordates (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Moreover, chemokine IL-8 and transforming growth factor &#x03B2;1 are vertebrate cytokines involved in inflammatory processes and molecules crossreacting with the two proteins using antibodies have been identified in mollusks (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, IL-2-like activity is detected in protochordates and echinoderms which have hematopoietic organs and T-like cells (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In this study, our data suggested that an invertebrate cytokine network might be operative and regulate host defense mechanisms against virus infection as in vertebrates.</p>
