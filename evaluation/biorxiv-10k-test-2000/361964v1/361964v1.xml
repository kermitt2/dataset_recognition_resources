<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Drought can severely limit plant growth and production. However, few studies have investigated gene expression profiles in maize during drought/re-watering. We compared drought-treated and water-sufficient maize plants by measuring their leaf relative water content, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities, proline content, and leaf gas exchange parameters (photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates). We conducted RNA sequencing analyses to elucidate gene expression profiles and identify miRNAs that might be related to drought resistance. A GO enrichment analysis showed that the common DEGs (differently expressed genes) between drought-treated and control plants were involved in response to stimulus, cellular process, metabolic process, cell part, and binding and catalytic activity. Analyses of gene expression profiles revealed that 26 of the DEGs under drought encoded 10 enzymes involved in proline synthesis, suggesting that increased proline synthesis was a key part of the drought response. We also investigated cell wall-related genes and transcription factors regulating abscisic acid-dependent and -independent pathways. The expression profiles of the miRNAs miR6214-3p, miR5072-3p, zma-miR529-5p, zma-miR167e-5p, zma-miR167f-5p, and zma-miR167j-5p and their relevant targets under drought conditions were analyzed. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance, and may identify new targets for breeding drought-tolerant maize lines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maize is one of the three major food crops and it has an ancient cultivation history. Drought is one of the most important environmental factors that severely affects plant growth, yields, and crop quality on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boyer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tollenaar and Lee, 2002</xref>). Cultivating fine varieties of maize with enhanced drought resistance is of great practical significance to increase maize yield. Therefore, the discovery of drought-resistance genes to breed drought-resistant maize lines is one way to address the issue of drought in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Monneveux et al., 2006</xref>). Now that the whole genomes of maize and other plants have been sequenced, many researchers are taking advantage of RNA-seq to study the gene expression patterns in plants under different environmental conditions or at different growth stages. Such studies have provided a great deal of important information about the regulation of gene expression and have identified candidate genes associated with specific traits such as drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Transcriptome analyses have been very useful to discover the functions of various genes in maize. For example, such studies have identified genes involved in the response to various abiotic stresses such as low-phosphorus (low-P), excess nitrate, ultraviolet-B radiation, oxidative stress, and drought. A transcriptome analysis of maize seedling roots under low-P stress identified key genes involved in the response to low-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Calderon-Vazquez et al., 2008</xref>). In another study, transcriptome sequencing of maize roots subjected to nitrate stress demonstrated the co-transcriptional pattern of nitric oxide synthesis/clearance genes in root epidermal cells (Begheldo, 2011). The responses of maize leaves and ears to irradiation of varying duration was investigated using transcriptome and metabolomics analyses, which revealed that the early response in all tissues may be caused by the same signaling pathway, while the response becomes increasingly organizational-specific with longer irradiation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Casa ti, Morrow, Fernandes, &#x0026; Walbot, 2011</xref>). Analyses of the gene expression profile of the maize Rg1 mutant revealed the roles of Rg1 in dissipating reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Guan et al., 2012</xref>). A microarray analysis of the gene expression profile of maize B73 under various stress conditions found that key genes may be expressed at critical sites to regulate gene expression under different stress conditions, thereby playing important roles increasing stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fernandes, Casati, &#x0026; Walbot, 2008</xref>). Studies on the gene expression profiles of maize under drought stress have indicated that drought-resistant varieties more effectively activate the expression of drought-related genes after water stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hayanokanashiro, Calder&#x00F3;nv&#x00E1;zquez, Ibarralaclette, Herreraestrella, &#x0026; Simpson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small molecule single-stranded RNAs encoded by endogenous genes with a length of about 16-29 nt. The precursors of miRNAs have a hairpin structure. miRNAs were first discovered in nematodes and were subsequently predicted to exist in plants such as rice, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, maize, and <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mica, Gianfranceschi, &#x0026; P&#x00E8;, 2006</xref>). miRNAs can regulate gene expression by degrading target RNAs at the post-transcriptional level or inhibiting translation at the translation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Humphreys &#x0026; Preiss, 2005</xref>). These processes participate in regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells. In plants, genes encoding miRNAs are located in intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Voinnet, 2009</xref>) or in gene introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lagosquintana, Rauhut, Lendeckel, &#x0026; Tuschl, 2001</xref>). Some miRNA genes are close to each other and form gene clusters, and these miRNA genes can co-transcribe to form one primary miRNA (pri-mi RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Many miRNAs have been verified in plants, and have been shown to be involved in diverse stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jia &#x0026; Tang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jones-Rhoades &#x0026; Bartel, 2004</xref>). Solexa sequencing revealed that the miR528, miRl59, miR164, miR167, miR169, miR319, and miR396 families were highly expressed in the root; and the miR156, 166, 167, and 168 families were expressed in different parts and growth stages. These findings highlighted that the abundance of miRNAs varies among different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The drought resistance of plants is judged as their ability to endure drought stress and rapidly resume growth after re-watering. Being able to resume growth after re-watering is relatively more important for maize yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chaves &#x0026; Oliveira, 2004</xref>). Few studies have investigated gene expression profiles and searched for drought-resistance genes in maize after re-watering (Chen et al., 2015). Transcriptome analysis is a useful tool to analyze the regulatory networks that operate during drought treatment. Therefore, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression profile and identify miRNAs related to drought resistance in maize during and after a drought treatment. We compared the RWC (leaf relative water content), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, proline (Pro) content, and leaf gas exchange parameters between water-deficit and water-sufficient maize plants. We also detected differences in global gene expression that could be related to the drought response. Finally, we analyzed cell wall-related genes and transcription factors regulating the abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and ABA-independent pathways. The results of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the drought response in maize. This information could be used to breed drought-tolerant maize lines using molecular breeding methods.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Plant growth conditions and drought treatment</title>
<p>Seeds of maize were surface sterilized by soaking in 2&#x0025; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min and rinsing with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Then, the seeds were germinated in an incubator for 24 h at 28&#x00B0;C. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse under a 14 h/10 h light/dark photoperiod, 60&#x0025; relative humidity, and light intensity of 120 &#x03BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Seedlings were grown in half-strength modified Hoagland&#x2019;s nutrient solution (pH 5.8), which was refreshed every 3 days. For the drought treatment, seedlings at the 3-fully expanded leaf stage were transferred to nutrient solution containing 20&#x0025; polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Leaves were harvested at 60 and 96 h of the drought treatment and after 3 d of recovery (denoted as T60, T96 and TR3d, respectively), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Control seedlings were grown under the same conditions but were not subjected to PEG treatment. Three plants from three different containers of each treatment were used as biological replicates.</p>

<title>Analysis of physiological characteristics</title>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Leaf relative water content analysis</title>
<p>The youngest fully expanded leaves were removed and weighed immediately to measure fresh weight (FW). Turgid weight (TW) was determined after leaf segments were immersed in distilled water for 6 h, and dry weight (DW) was measured after leaf segments were dried at 70&#x00B0;C for 24 h. Each treatment included five replicates. The relative water content (RWC) was calculated as follows: RWC (&#x0025;) &#x003D; [(FW&#x2013;DW)/(TW&#x2013;DW)] &#x00D7; 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Leaf gas exchange analysis</title>
<p>The photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates of individual leaves were measured using a portable photosynthesis system (Li-6400; LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The youngest fully expanded leaf was placed in the chamber at a photon flux density of 1000 &#x03BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; the flow rate through the chamber was 500 &#x03BC;mol/s, and the leaf temperature was 28&#x00B0;C. The ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was approximately 380 &#x03BC;mol CO<sub>2</sub> mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>air, and the vapor pressure deficit was approximately 2.0 kPa. Five biological replicates were analyzed at the same time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>Osmolyte accumulation profiles</title>
<p>The free proline (Pro) content in fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) was determined with the ninhydrin method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bates, Waldren, &#x0026; Teare, 1973</xref>). The reaction mixture was extracted with 5 ml toluene, cooled to room temperature, and its absorbance was read at 520 nm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b4">
<title>Antioxidant enzyme activity</title>
<p>We determined SOD activity using an A001-1 kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required for 1 mg tissue protein in a 1-ml reaction mixture to raise SOD inhibition rates to 50&#x0025; at 550 nm (Tecan Infinite M200, M&#x00E4;nnedorf, Switzerland). The activity of POD was determined as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Upadhyaya, Sankhla, Davis, Sankhla, &#x0026; Smith (1985)</xref>. The absorbance of the reaction mixture containing 100 ml enzyme extract, 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 28 ml guaiacol, and 19 ml H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was read at 420 at 30 s intervals up to 2 min. The change in absorbance was used to calculate POD activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b5">
<title>RNA extraction</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The RNA samples were treated with 10 units DNase I (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) for 30 min at 37&#x00B0;C to remove genomic DNA. The RNA concentrations were measured with a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the RNA quality was verified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a minimum RNA integrated number value of 8.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b6">
<title>Illumina sequencing and quality controls</title>
<p>After total RNA was extracted, mRNA was enriched using Oligo (dT) beads. The enriched mRNA was reverse transcribed, PCR amplified, and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq<sup>&#x2122;</sup> 2500 platform by the Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China). The total reads obtained from the sequencing machines included those containing adapters or low-quality bases, which can affect the following assembly and analysis. Thus, to obtain high quality clean reads, reads were filtered by removing those containing adapters and those containing more than 10&#x0025; unknown nucleotides (N) and more than 50&#x0025; low quality (Q-value&#x2264;20) bases. Last, the ribosome RNA (rRNA) mapped reads were removed through mapping reads to the rRNA database using the short reads alignment tool Bowtie2. The remaining reads were used for transcriptome assembly and analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2b7">
<title>Relationship analysis of samples</title>
<p>A correlation analysis of parallel experiments evaluated both the reliability of experimental results and the operational stability. The correlation coefficient between replicates was calculated to evaluate the repeatability between samples. The closer the correlation coefficient to 1, the better the repeatability between two parallel experiments.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that converts hundreds of thousands of correlated variables (gene expression) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables known as principal components. We conducted a PCA using the gmodels in the R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>/).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b8">
<title>Identification of differentially expressed genes</title>
<p>To identify DEGs between samples or groups, we used the edgeR package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>/). We identified genes with a -fold change &#x2265;2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) &#x003C;0.05 in a comparison as significant DEGs. The DEGs were then subjected to enrichment analysis of GO functions and KEGG pathways. The GO enrichment analysis provided all GO terms that were significantly enriched in DEGs compared with the genome background, and filtered the DEGs that corresponded to biological functions. The pathway enrichment analysis identified metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways significantly enriched with DEGs, compared with the whole genome background.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b9">
<title>miRNA sequencing and target predictions</title>
<p>After total RNA was extracted using TRIzol, the RNA molecules in the size range of 18&#x2013;30 nt were enriched by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Then, 3&#x2019; and 5&#x2019; adapters were ligated to the RNAs, and the ligation products were reverse-transcribed by PCR amplification. The 140&#x2013;160 bp PCR products were enriched to generate a cDNA library and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq<sup>&#x2122;</sup> 2500 platform by the Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. Based on the sequences of the existing miRNAs, known miRNAs, and novel miRNAs, candidate target genes were predicted using the software patmatch (v1.2) with the default parameters. The GO and KEGG pathway analyses of these genes were performed using Blast2GO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b10">
<title>Gene expression validation</title>
<p>We selected 24 genes with different expression patterns as revealed by RNA sequencing for validation by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We extracted RNA from the leaves of three independent biological replicates for each of T0, T60, T96, and TR3d and each of their corresponding controls. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Gene-specific primers for qPCR were designed based on the corresponding sequence using Primer5 and are listed in Supplementary Table S2 (Supporting Information). <italic>ActinI</italic> was used as an internal control. The qPCR analyses were carried out using SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (TaKaRa) on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Three technical replicates were analyzed for each gene.</p>

<title>Physiological characteristics of <italic>Zea mays</italic> under drought stress and re-watering</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of drought stress on maize, the plants were exposed to 96 hours of water deficit, and then re-watered. Samples were collected from the drought-treated plants at 0 h, 60 h, and 96 h of drought and at 3 days after re-watering, and from well-watered (CK) plants at the same times. In CK conditions, the plants tended to grow normally with tall and straight leaves and stalks. Conversely, under drought conditions, the plants drooped. The RWC in leaves was significantly higher in the CK group than in drought-stressed group in the first 96 hours (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The differences in RWC between the drought-stressed and CK plants increased until 96 hours, then decreased after re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Drought stress leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which result in cell damage. To determine the differences in ROS-scavenging capacities between the drought-stressed and CK plants, we determined the activities of POD and SOD. The SOD and POD activities were higher in the drought-stressed group than in the CK group during first 96 hours, but higher in the CK group than in the drought-stressed group after re-watering. The greatest difference in SOD values between drought-stressed and CK plants was at 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). After re-watering, the SOD activities were approximately equal in the CK and drought-stressed groups. The POD activity was lower in the drought-stressed group than in the CK group in the first 96 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), but higher in the drought-stressed group than in the CK group at 3 d after re-watering.</p>
<p>To evaluate drought adaptation, we measured gas exchange parameters. The photosynthetic rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>), stomatal conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>), and transpiration rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>) decreased under prolonged drought stress, compared with their corresponding values in the control. After re-watering, the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate recovered rapidly so that their levels in the drought-stressed group were equal to those in the CK group. The photosynthetic rate in the drought-stressed also increased after re-watering, but not to the same level as that in the CK group.</p>

<p>To study the involvement of regulatory miRNAs in the complex process of the maize drought response, we profiled miRNA accumulation. After trimming adaptor sequences and removing contaminated reads, approximately 10 million tags were obtained, ranging from 16 to 35 nt in length. Of these, the 21 nt category was the most abundant, followed by the 22 nt and 24 nt categories (Supplementary Fig. S1). These were consistent with the typical lengths of plant mature small RNAs reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rajagopalan et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moxon et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fahlgren et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wang et al, 2011</xref>). In each sample, 76&#x0025;&#x2013;79&#x0025; of the tags matched perfectly to the maize genome. Through target prediction, a total of 1028 miRNAs were predicted to regulate 11,118 genes with 22,677 target loci.</p>
<p>We constructed a normalized cDNA library using a mixed pool of equal amounts of 18 mRNA populations that had been extracted from leaves of plants at 60 h and 96 h of the drought treatment and at 3 days after re-watering. The library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using the paired-end protocol. Filtering and conversion of raw reads to FASTQ format resulted in 1,201,588,344 paired-end reads with lengths of at least 2 &#x00D7; 150 nucleotides (Supplementary Table S1).</p>
<p>The resulting reads were aligned to the <italic>Z. mays</italic> genome that was retrieved from NCBI. The transcriptome data have been deposited to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number PRJNA477643. The Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficients of gene expression among repeats of each sample were relatively high. Taking CK60 as an example, the coefficient of the three repeats was greater than 0.9. The gene expression level was normalized by FPKM (Supplementary Fig. S2).</p>

<title>Identification of differentially expressed genes in maize during drought and after re-watering</title>
<p>To identify genes with altered expression levels under drought conditions, the mRNA profiles of control plants (CK60, CK96, and CKR3d) were compared with those of plants subjected to drought stress and re-watering (T60, T96, and TR3d). Compared with the CK group in the first 60 hours, the group subjected to 60 hours of drought treatment had 3095 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1693 were up-regulated and 1402 were down-regulated. In T96 versus CK96, 942 genes were up-regulated and 999 were down-regulated. In TR3d versus CKR3d, there were significantly more down-regulated genes (4244) than up-regulated genes (1722) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In total, 478 DEGs were commonly shared among three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We detected 221, 226 and 215 differentially expressed miRNAs at 60 h, 96 h, and 3d, respectively, between the CK group and the drought-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>The miRNA sequencing results showed that in the first 60 hours of drought, 58 miRNAs were up-regulated and 163 miRNAs were down-regulated. In T96 versus CK96, 106 miRNAs were up-regulated and 120 were down-regulated. In TR3d versus CKR3d, 97 miRNAs were up-regulated and 118 were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>According to their functional classifications, we compared the significantly regulated genes at each of the three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). On the whole, the differentially regulated genes in the first 60 hours of drought stress were related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism, indicating a direct influence of drought on carbohydrate synthesis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). At 96 hours, the differentially regulated genes were mainly related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. After re-watering, the differentially regulated genes were mainly related to carbon metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids. At 60 and 96 hours of drought stress, some DEGs encoded proteins involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, indicating the common involvement of these processes in the drought stress response. After re-watering, the pathways of carbon metabolism were re-activated.</p>

<title>Identification of genes involved in cell wall</title>
<p>Drought caused a significant up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular membrane stabilization and cell wall strengthening. These included the lipid-binding protein, non-specific lipid transfer protein, plant cell wall proteins, and wax synthase. Membranes are the main targets of degenerating processes that occur during drought, therefore, adaptation of membrane lipids to drought conditions might be a key mechanism for drought tolerance. Significantly more genes involved in cell wall formation were up-regulated in the first 60 hours of drought stress, but significantly more genes involved in the cell wall were down-regulated in the drought-treated group than in the CK group at 3 days after re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The increased expression of cell wall-related genes may have increased the mechanical resistance of cells in drought-stressed plants. To identify the regulatory miRNAs of these DEGs involved in the cell wall, a network analysis of miRNA-genes was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The results showed that nine target genes were regulated by three novel miRNAs (novel-m0661-5p, novel-m0125-3p, and novel-m0283-3p) and five known miRNAs (miR9760-5p, miR5809-5p, miR5076-5p, miR6214-3p, and miR5783-5p).</p>

<title>Proline metabolism pathways in maize under drought stress and re-watering</title>
<p>Proline accumulation has long been associated with stress tolerance in plants. Proline is assumed to aid in osmotic adjustment in response to drought, however, it also plays roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and membrane stability. Our physiological analyzes of maize under drought stress revealed that proline significantly accumulated in maize leaves at 60 h of drought stress (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.01), but its levels did not differ significantly between drought-stressed and CK plants at other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We investigated the expression profiles of genes involved in proline biosynthesis in response to drought stress. We identified 26 DEGs encoding 10 enzymes involved in proline synthesis. Except for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, EC 1.2.1.3), prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H, EC 1.14.11.2), and spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16), which were encoded by five, nine, and four genes, respectively, all the remaining enzymes were encoded by single gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). All DEGs in this pathway were clearly up-regulated in the first 96 hours of the drought treatment, except for ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) and two homologs of ALDH (EC 1.2.1.3). These results suggested that maize cells increased proline synthesis in response to drought stress. The expression levels of DEGs in this pathway are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>. The miRNAs analysis revealed that miR5556-5p, miR6214-3p, and novel-m0228-3p regulated three DEGs involved in proline metabolism GRMZM2G146677 (encoding aspartate aminotransferase), GRMZM2G034152 (encoding polyamine oxidase), and GRMZM2G054224 (encoding P4H), respectively.</p>

<title>Identification and expression analysis of transcription factors involved in the maize response to drought and re-watering</title>
<p>Various transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators have been found to regulate a plethora of genes and consequently confer drought tolerance. Many studies have shown that under drought stress, crops accumulate high levels of ABA, accompanied by major changes in gene expression (Galle et al. 2013; Ye et al. 2012). The ABA signaling mechanism is conserved in economically important plants, including rice and maize. Structural and computational studies have shown that the residues that comprise the gate-latch-lock components are highly conserved across species (Cao et al. 2013). High-throughput sequencing has provided information about the perception, signaling, and transportation of ABA under drought. Some of the interesting findings from crops like sugarcane are the increased abundance of bZIP factors, which may activate the transcription of drought-related genes. Here, we found that drought increased the abundance of an ABA signaling unit composed of five transcription factors (MYB/MYC, bZIP, NAC, HD-ZIP and DREB) involved in ABA-dependent or -independent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). An analysis of the miRNAs that regulate these transcription factors revealed that MYB/MYC, bZIP, NAC, and DREB were regulated by two microRNAs, while HD-ZIP was regulated by miR165-5p. The fact that MYB/MYC, NAC, and DREB were all regulated by miR5783-5p suggested that miR5783-5p plays a vital role in the regulation of the ABA signal transduction pathway in drought-stressed maize. At 60 hours of drought treatment, bZIP was activated in the drought-treated maize plants. The up-regulation of this transcription factor was related to the accumulation of dark red pigment in the drought-treated plants. The same phenomenon was observed at 96 hours of drought treatment, when bZIP was also expressed at much higher levels in drought-treated plants than in CK plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). At 3 days after re-watering, the transcript levels of the transcription factors were lower in the drought-treated plants than in the CK plants, indicating shut-down of the ABA-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). To confirm the reliability of the DEGs identified from the RNA sequencing analysis, 24 genes involved in the ABA signal transduction pathway were selected for qRT-PCR using the specific primers listed in the Supplementary Table S1. The results of qRT-PCR were correlated with those obtained in the transcriptome analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3).</p>

<p>The results of the fluorescent quantitative analysis of miR6214-3p were consistent with the sequencing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). We used the Cytoscape platform to build the network between the drought-responsive miRNAs and their targets. This allowed us to study the regulation of miR6214-3p on multiple target genes and explore its mechanism under drought stress. It was found that miR6214-3p may be involved in the regulation of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and pro-anabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5A</xref>), it may regulate DREB-related genes involved in ABA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.6A</xref>), and it may also regulate genes encoding chlorophyll a-b binding protein, as well as the BHLH and MYB transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>).

These genes encoded proteins related to carotenoids (which are involved in ABA synthesis), protein phosphatase (PP2C), plant-specific serine/threonine kinase, and the ABA-responsive element binding factor. Four miRNAs were down-regulated under drought stress; Zma-miR529-5p, miR5072-3p, zma-miR167f-5p, ma-miR167j-5p, and zma-miR167e-5p. These miRNAs have potential roles in cell division, plant growth, stomatal closure, and the stress response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Drought is one of the main factors limiting plant growth and production. In practice, crops are subjected to continuous cycles of water deficit and re-watering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perrone et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the capacity of plants to recover from drought is also important, particularly in crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perrone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Vankov&#x00E1; et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fang and Xiong, 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is important to study the mechanisms of both drought resistance and recovery to improve crop yields under drought stress.</p>
<p>Drought tolerance is a complex trait. It involves multiple mechanisms that act together to avoid or tolerate periods of water deficit. Plants vary in the types and speed of responses to drought, depending on their genetic and ecotypic backgrounds. However, a number of drought responsive genes are conserved across plant taxa, especially genes encoding proteins involved in osmotic adjustment, detoxification, and cell communication and signaling. Previous studies have reported two kinds of stress-inducible genes. The first kind are genes encoding regulatory proteins (transcription factors, protein kinases, protein phosphatases) and proteins involved in signal transduction. The second kind are genes involved in water transport, cellular membrane protection, and integrity under stress conditions, scavenging of ROS (SOD, POD), and protection of macromolecules. Transcription factors that function in ABA-dependent pathways are also known to be up-regulated under drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Campos, Cooper, Habben, Edmeades, &#x0026; Schussler, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Physiological responses to drought stress and re-watering</title>
<p>The synthesis and accumulation of ROS is promoted under stress conditions, and ROS can damage biological membranes and organic molecules. Our results showed that the activities of POD and SOD in maize leaves were significantly higher under drought stress than under CK conditions, and that their activities decreased to normal levels at 3 days after re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>). This is consistent with a previous report, which noted that increased SOD and POD activities to quench ROS were related to drought tolerance in Chinese water melon (<italic>Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus</italic>), i.e., drought stress stimulated the enzymatic antioxidant defense system (Yan et al., 2015).</p>
<p>The primary reaction under drought stress is to modulate the aperture of stomata. Stomatal opening and closing modulates water loss and photosynthesis. Under drought conditions, the lack of water results in tissue dehydration in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Auchincloss, Easlon, Levine, Donovan, &#x0026; Richards, 2014</xref>). Under such conditions, maize regulates water transport by controlling stomatal movement to prevent tissue damage. Drought can also directly affect the photosynthetic process. Drought-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in subsidiary cells was shown to be involved in regulatory signaling of stomatal closure in maize leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yao et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, our results showed that the photosynthetic rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>), stomatal conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and transpiration rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>) were decreased by degrees under drought stress compared with CK, then recovered to normal levels after re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D&#x2013;F</xref>).</p>

<p>The cell wall is the first line of defense against abiotic stress. Many proteins that are involved in cell wall processes during normal development are also recruited during defense-related cell wall remodeling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Maurice Bosch et al., 2011</xref>). A transcriptional analysis of GRMZ2G026980 confirmed the stimulatory effect of nitrate on xyloglucan accumulation in cells of the transition zone of the root apex; GRMZ2G026980 encodes a cell wall extension protein related to cell wall synthesis (Manoli et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fry et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Geilfus et al., 2011</xref>).

The proteins encoded by three DEGs, GRMZ2G112686 (target of miR5076-5p, miR5783-5p, novel-m0283-3p), GRMZ2G026980 (xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein 2, target of miR6214-3p,novel-m0611-5p,miR5783-5p) and GRMZ2G082184 (aquaporin NIP, target of miR9760-5p, 6214-3p, 5809-5p) are known to participate in secondary metabolite synthesis and influence the synthesis of the cell wall.

P4Hs are a large family of oxidoreductases that act on paired donors with O<sub>2</sub> as the oxidant.

P4Hs catalyze proline synthesis and are involved in sensing hypoxia. They are upregulated in response to hypoxia, and are oxygen-dependent. Previous studies on mammals have provided clues about how these enzymes sense hypoxia. They catalyze the hydroxylation of proline to control a transcription factor [hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)] that functions as a global regulator of hypoxia in various organisms. That is, proline hydroxylation targets HIF for rapid ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation when oxygen is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ivan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jaakkola et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In plants, up-regulation of ALDHs is a response to various stresses including dehydration, salinity, and oxidative stress.

<title>Drought stress induces ABA signaling in leaves</title>
<p>In plants, ABA plays a central role in many aspects of the response to various stress signals, and participates in tolerance to drought and high salinity. Previous studies have shown that the exogenous application of ABA significantly increases the ability of the plant to retain water, and that ABA accumulates to higher levels in drought-tolerant strains than in susceptible ones. In this study, many of the DEGs under drought stress and re-watering were involved in ABA metabolism. Some of the DEGs encoded transcription factors (MYB, bZIP, NAC, and DREB) involved in ABA-dependent or -independent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

ZmMYB31 is involved in the drought stress response via the ABA-dependent pathway, and its expression level is controlled by miR5809. Its up-regulation under drought conditions suggested that ZmMYB31 plays a positive role in the maize drought response. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal et al. (2016)</xref> demonstrated that syntelogs of MYB31 and MYB42 bind to genes encoding enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway in different tissues and at different stages of development.</p>

<title>miRNAs play important roles in drought stress and re-watering</title>
<p>It has been reported that miRNAs are involved in biological processes such as growth and development, differentiation and proliferation, and apoptosis by regulating the expression of target genes. Most research on plant miRNA has been conducted on model plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. Few studies have focused on the roles of maize miRNAs under stress conditions. In this study, we searched for genes related to drought resistance that are controlled by miRNAs. These results will not only help us to understand the mechanism of drought resistance in maize, but also identify potential targets to breed new drought-resistant maize varieties. In addition, the discovery of miRNAs related to drought tolerance in maize has good prospects for application. Transgenic drought-tolerant plants could be obtained by over-expressing miRNAs related to drought tolerance. This lays a theoretical foundation for the development of new drought-resistant varieties.</p>
<p>In a previous study, the down-regulation of miR6214-3p was associated with the activation of the stress response and antioxidant system in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). In this work, we found that miR6214-3p was down-regulated under drought stress and up-regulated at 3 days after re-watering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). The predicted targets of miR6214-3p were involved in the metabolism and signaling pathways of the drought tolerance response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The BHLH family is one of the largest families of plant transcription factors, and its members all contain two regions (basic and HLH). Plant bHLH transcription factors bind to G-box elements in gene promoters, and are involved in growth, signal transduction, and stress tolerance. In this study, GRMZM2G313058, GRMZM2G463133, and GRMZM2G333582, which are targeted by miR6214-3p, were found to HLHs involved in drought tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). It has been reported that the homolog of GRMZM2G313058, AtHLH112, is a transcriptional activator that mediates proline biosynthesis and increases the expression of <italic>POD</italic> and <italic>SOD</italic> genes to increase ROS scavenging and enhance stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The wheat bHLH041 transcription factor, which is homolog of GRMZM2G463133 and GRMZM2G333582, was found to be associated with a high degree of cob resistance through controlling the expression of genes that strengthen the cell wall and detoxify mycotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dhokane et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Three predicted targets of miR6214-3p (GRMZM2G065829, GRMZM2G049695, and GRMZM2G159119) belonged to MYB superfamily, whose members are involved in signaling pathways during plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress, and regulate the synthesis of the secondary cell wall. The expression levels of these genes differed under drought conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). MYBR35 (encoded by GRMZM2G065829) most likely functions as a transcriptional activator. Previous studies showed that DYT1 (a putative bHLH transcription factor) can activate the expression of the downstream transcription factor genes <italic>MYB35</italic> and <italic>MS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Feller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). The expression level of GRMZM2G065829 decreased dramatically during drought, then increased to higher levels than those in the CK after re-watering (Supplementary Fig. S4). The expression pattern of GRMZM2G049695 was opposite to that of GRMZM2G065829. A previous study reported that GtMYB1R1, which shares homology with the protein encoded by GRMZM2G049695, interacts with GtbHLH1 to significantly reduce anthocyanin accumulation in flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nakatsuka et al., 2013</xref>). The expression level of GRMZM2G159119 decreased rapidly during drought and then increased gradually to normal levels as the drought treatment continued (Supplementary Fig. S4). This expression pattern was consistent with that reported in a previous study, where this transcription factor was shown to be involved in down-regulating genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and possibly other C4-specific enzymes under nitrogen-deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Urte Schl&#x00FC;ter et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the DEGs, GRMZM2G072280, GRMZM2G160268, and GRMZM2G036880 (encoding chlorophyll a/b binding proteins) were regulated by miR6214-3p under drought stress. In another study, the down-regulation of GRMZM2G72280, which encodes the PSI component Lhca2, resulted in reduced synthesis of PSI antenna, and thus reduced light absorption under low-nitrogen stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mu et al., 2017</xref>). These genes were initially down-regulated under drought stress, and then recovered to normal levels as the drought treatment continued. This finding suggested that the photosynthesis of maize leaves might be inhibited under drought stress, but was able to recover as the plants adjusted their metabolic processes to adapt to the drought conditions. Consistent with this, our physiological analyses confirmed that photosynthesis recovered after re-watering.</p>
<p>The up-regulated miRNAs under drought was the novel-m0414-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Meanwhile, four miRNAs were down-regulated under drought stress: zma-miR529-5p, zma-miR167f-5p, zma-miR167j-5p, zma-miR167e-5p, and miR5072-3p-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). These miRNAs have potential roles in cell division, plant growth, stomatal closure, and the stress response. Of these microRNAs, miR167 has been shown to mediate the expression of its target genes in the drought response of many plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, cassava, and tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kinoshita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Phookaew, Netrphan, Sojikul, &#x0026; Narangajavana, 2014</xref>). miR5072 has been shown to modulate the synthesis of acetyl-CoA acylase by tanshinones, and the synthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites in <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, ultimately affecting biological processes such as growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). miR529 was found to be involved in the cold response, but not in the responses to osmotic and salt stress in wheat. However, it was identified as a drought-responsive microRNA in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gupta, Meena, Sharma, &#x0026; Sharma, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, miR529 was down-regulated under drought stress, suggesting that it plays some role in the drought stress response in maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, drought stress resulted in decreased photosynthesis, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and increased proline content in maize plants. Genes related to the cell wall and transcription factors regulating the ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways were among the DEGs under drought stress. The aim of this work was to compare changes at the physiological and gene expression levels between drought-stressed and well-watered maize plants. This allowed us identify the general responses of maize to drought stress and to explore some of the mechanisms related to the acquisition of drought tolerance.</p>
