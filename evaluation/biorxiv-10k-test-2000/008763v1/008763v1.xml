<title>ABSTRACT</title><p>High-throughput RNA sequencing allows genome-wide analyses of pre-mRNA splicing across multiple conditions. However, the increasing number of available datasets represents a major challenge in terms of time and storage required for analyses. Here we describe SUPPA, a computational pipeline to calculate relative inclusion values of alternative splicing events, exploiting fast transcript quantification of a known annotation. SUPPA provides a fast and accurate approach to calculate inclusion levels of alternative splicing events from a large number of samples, thereby facilitating systematic analyses in the context of large-scale projects using limited computational resources. SUPPA is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/suppa">https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/suppa</ext-link> under the MIT license and is implemented in Python 2.7.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Alternative splicing plays an important role in many cellular processes and has been linked to multiple diseases. High-throughput RNA sequencing has facilitated the study of alternative splicing at genome scale and under multiple conditions. However, as more datasets become available, a bottleneck appears in relation to the required time and storage space required for analysis, representing a major obstacle for large-scale projects and the analysis of publicly available data. We have developed SUPPA, an effective computational pipeline for the rapid calculation of the of relative inclusion values of alternative splicing events from a large number of samples.</p>
<p>The description of alternative splicing in terms of events facilitates their experimental validation and their characterization in terms of regulatory mechanisms; and is also motivated by the current limitations in transcript reconstruction from short sequencing reads. On the other hand, recent developments in the quantification of known transcripts have shown that considerable quality can be achieved at very high speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Li et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Patro et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>). These methods can thus provide in very short time an accurate census of mRNA molecules in a given condition for a deeply annotated genome as human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Harrow et al. 2012</xref>). The relative inclusion, or PSI, of a splicing event is generally defined as the fraction of mRNA isoforms that include an exon or a specific form of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Wang et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Brosseau et al. 2010</xref>), which is often estimated from the reads falling specifically on either form of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Wang et al. 2008</xref>). SUPPA calculates PSI values directly from transcript isoform abundance values. We argue that this provides a fast and accurate approach to systematic splicing analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>An alternative splicing event is a binary representation of a local splicing variation in a gene. In this context, the PSI value of an event can be defined as the ratio of the abundance of mRNAs that include one form of the event, <italic>F<sub>1</sub></italic> over the abundance of mRNAs that contain either form of the event, <italic>F<sub>1</sub></italic>&#x222A;<italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic>. Given the abundances for all transcripts isoforms, assumed without loss of generality to be given in transcript per million units (TPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Li et al. 2010</xref>), which we denote as <italic>TPM<sub>k</sub></italic>, SUPPA calculates the PSI (&#x03A8;<sub>q</sub>) for an event as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="008763_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
SUPPA performs this calculation in two steps. The first one, <italic>generateEvents</italic>, reads an annotation file in GTF format and produces information about alternative splicing events in the annotation. SUPPA calculates exon skipping events, alternative 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; splice-sites, mutually exclusive exons, intron retention, and alternative first and last exons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). The &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> values for all events are then calculated in a second step with the operation <italic>psiPerEvent</italic>, which uses as input the output from <italic>generateEvents</italic> and the abundances for all transcripts in one or more samples, which are previously obtained with a fast transcript quantification method (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Although SUPPA is limited to the splicing events available in the gene annotation, events can be expanded with novel transcript variants obtained by other means. SUPPA also includes a tool to combine multiple input files from the transcript quantification and to obtain PSI values for transcript isoforms. More details are given in the documentation of the software.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>To calculate 107,506 alternative splicing events from the Ensembl 75 annotation (37.494 genes, 135.521 transcripts), <italic>generateEvents</italic> took 10 minutes on a 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon, and 2 mins and 43 secs in a 2.9 Ghz Intel Core i7 processor. On the other hand, <italic>psiPerEvent</italic> took less than a minute in both machines to obtain the &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> values (output size 26 Mb) for these events using 8 RNA-Seq samples previously processed with Sailfish. Similarly, <italic>psiPerEvent</italic> took 4 mins and 50 secs on a 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon for 929 breast tumor samples from TCGA for 40411 events (Supp. Material). Considering that the events only need to be computed once, SUPPA speed is very competitive.</p>
<p>We performed a benchmarking analysis by comparing SUPPA &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> values with those obtained from junction reads (&#x03A8;<sub>j</sub>), defined in (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig 2</xref>) on a set of non-overlapping alternative splicing events (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). First, simulated reads obtained with FluxSimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Griebel et al. 2012</xref>) were mapped to the genome with STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Dobin et al. 2013</xref>) and reads in junctions were counted with sjcount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Pervouchine et al. 2013</xref>) to calculate &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> values. The same simulated reads were used to quantify transcript abundances with Sailfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Patro et al. 2014</xref>). SUPPA &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> shows a high correlation with &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> (Pearson R&#x003D;0.94) over 1041 non-overlapping events, including exons skipping, alternative 5&#x2019;/3&#x0027;splice-sites and mutually exclusive exon events (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). This correlation is also high (R&#x003D;0.92) when comparing SUPPA results to the values obtained from the simulated number of molecules (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="008763_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We also used RNA sequencing from nuclear and cytosolic fractions from MCF7 and MCF10 cells. Correlations between biological replicates were high for SUPPA &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> values (Pearson R&#x003D; 0.91-0.93) and improved when only genes with TPM&#x003E;1 (calculated as the sum of TPMs of the transcripts in each gene) were used (Pearson R&#x003D;0.97-0.99) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp. Figs. 6</xref>-<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). SUPPA correlations between replicates were in all cases superior to those the junction-based values (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 10</xref>), calculated as above. Moreover, SUPPA systematically recovers more events than using junction reads at similar correlation value between replicates (Supp. Material). Comparison between &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> and &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> values, using events with more than 20 junction reads in genes with TPM&#x003E;1 and, showed a good correspondence in all samples tested (Pearson R&#x003D;0.73-0.78) (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supp. Figs. 11</xref>-<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). Moreover, to account for 3&#x2019; end sequencing biases (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 15</xref>) the analysis was repeated quantifying protein-coding sequences only and comparing events occurring in CDS regions (see Supp. Material). This showed a considerable increase in the correlation between &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> and &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> values (R&#x003D;0.89-0.93) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Supp. Figs. 16</xref>-<xref rid="figs19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>).</p>
<p>As an additional benchmark, we calculated TPM values for transcript isoforms using the RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma from the TCGA project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/</ext-link>), and applied SUPPA to 55 tumor and paired normal samples. The &#x03A8; values calculated with SUPPA for two splicing events in the genes NUMB and BIN1, known to be upregulated in lung tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Misquitta-Ali et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Zong et al. 2014</xref>), show a good correlation with the &#x03A8; values calculated with junction reads (<xref rid="figs20" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 20</xref>).

<p>We downloaded the Ensembl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="supc1">1</xref>] Release 75 annotation file in GTF format from the Ensembl FTP server, and filtered out all the annotations on chromosomes other than autosomes or sex chromosomes, obtaining 37,494 genes and 135,521 transcripts. We then used the SUPPA <italic>generateEvents</italic> operation:
<disp-quote specific-use="block">
<p>/pathTo/python-2.7/python /pathTo/SUPPA/suppa.py generateEvents -i</p>
<p>/pathTo/ensembl_r75_filtered_annotation.gtf-o/pathTo/eventsOutput/-e SE SS MX RI FL</p>

<p>For the purpose of benchmarking, we compared the relative inclusion values obtained from transcript quantification (&#x03A8;<sub>q</sub>) produced by SUPPA, to those values obtained from junction reads (&#x03A8;<sub>j</sub>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We used events that do not overlap each other. The reason for this is that junctions are often shared between overlapping events, which introduce a confounding factor in the calculation of inclusion levels with junction-based methods (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Note that this confounding factor is circumvented by SUPPA, since the usage of a specific junction is given by the abundance of the transcripts that cover a form of the event, and not simply the junction (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Accordingly we selected for benchmarking the set of 8,636 alternative splicing events that are internal (exon skipping, alternative 5&#x2019;/3&#x2019; sites and mutually exclusive) and that do not overlap with any other event. Using coding transcripts only (see below), the number of non-overlapping events obtained was 9.337.</p>

MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15 mM hepes buffer, 10&#x0025; FBS, 10 mg/ml insulin, 25 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml choleratoxin and 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone. Cell fractionation was performed with PARIS Kit from Ambion following their instructions. Two biological replicates from each sample were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq-2000 using a standard stranded protocol. Sequencing reads are available at SRA under accession SRP045592 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP045592">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term&#x003D;SRP045592</ext-link>)

<caption><title>Calculation of relative inclusion levels from junction reads.</title>
<p>Reads falling on the different junctions (<italic>C<sub>ij</sub></italic>) are counted. For each alternative splicing event, the relative inclusion level (&#x03A8;) is defined in terms of the read counts on the junctions that describe the relevant splicing variation. Only internal events (exon-skipping, alternative 5&#x2019;/3&#x2019; splice-sites, mutually exclusive exons), described in the figure, were used for benchmarking.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Junctions common to more than one alternative splicing event.</title>
<p>The figure depicts an example of gene with two exon-skipping events that share a junction. The gene also contains an alternative 3&#x2019; splice-site event that is not represented as an event in the figure. Methods based on junction-reads would allocate the reads falling on the common junction <italic>n<sub>23</sub></italic> to the calculation of &#x03A8; for both skipping events. However, the non-common junctions (<italic>n<sub>12</sub></italic> and <italic>n&#x2019;<sub>12</sub></italic>) indicate that the common junction should mostly contribute to Event 1 rather than to Event 2. As a result, the estimation of the &#x03A8; value for Event 2 will be incorrect. This confounding factor is present in general for other types of events when they overlap each other. This effect would be circumvented by SUPPA, since the usage of a specific junction is given by the abundance of the transcripts that cover that junction, which also depends on the reads falling elsewhere along the transcript.</p></caption>

<title>Transcript quantification and <bold>&#x03A8;</bold><sub>q</sub> calculation</title>
<p>Sailfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="supc6">6</xref>] was used to generate the quantification of all transcripts in the filtered Ensembl Release 75 annotation file using the simulated and the real data. We first downloaded the FASTA sequences of the Ensembl transcripts corresponding to the same annotation as the GTF described earlier, and used it to generate the Sailfish index, selecting a k-mer size of 31 to minimize the number of reads mapping to different transcripts during the quantification step. We then proceeded with the quantification step by running Sailfish over the FASTQ files using the <italic>-l &#x201C;T&#x003D;PE:O&#x003D;&#x003E;&#x003C;:S&#x003D;AS&#x201D;</italic> flag. The process was analogous for coding transcripts. Only protein coding transcripts from Ensembl were quantified with Sailfish, and the GTF annotation (CDS lines) were used to generate events with SUPPA.</p>
<p>We used the <italic>psiPerEvent</italic> operation of SUPPA to calculate the &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> values from the transcript quantifications obtained by Sailfish for all the 8,636 alternative splicing events generated above with the <italic>generateEvents</italic> module of SUPPA. The value &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> is defined as the ratio of the set of mRNAs that include one form of the event, <italic>F<sub>1</sub></italic> over the mRNAs that contain both forms of the event, <italic>F<sub>1</sub></italic>&#x00C8;<italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic>. Provided the expression levels of all transcripts isoforms calculated with Sailfish, here denoted as <italic>TPM<sub>k</sub></italic>, then we quantify the event using the equation (1) from the main text.</p>
<p>The value &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> was calculated using the simulated and the real datasets. Additionally, we also calculated these values for the uncorrected and corrected TPMs given by Sailfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="supc6">6</xref>]. The commands used for these operations are given in <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supp. Table 4</xref>.

<title>Correlation between &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> and &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> values</title>
<p>For the correlations between &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> and &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> values we first filtered out, in each sample separately, all the events that did not fulfil any of the following conditions:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p><bold>Having a &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> value greater or equal to 0.</bold> This is imposed simply because SUPPA gives a &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> &#x003D;-1 when the transcripts in the denominator of the &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> formula have zero expression.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Having, at least, one read in the skipping junction.</bold> This condition is imposed to account for the fact that the junction-based &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> can never give a value smaller than 1 if there are no skipping reads, whereas &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> can give values &#x003C; 1 without skipping reads, since it uses abundance values for all the transcripts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Belonging to a gene with at least TPM &#x003E; 1</bold>, where this TPM is the sum of the TPM values from all transcripts in that gene. We have observed that the estimation of &#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> is better when the average expression of the genes is sufficiently high. In fact, the &#x0394;&#x03A8;<sub>q</sub> between replicates appears to be larger for genes with average expression TPM &#x2264; 1 (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supp. Figures 8</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Having at least 20 reads in total mapping at the junctions.</bold> Similarly to condition c), the estimation of PSI from junction reads is more robust when a minimum of reads is required to be at the junctions, as shown in (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supp Figure 10</xref>).</p></list-item>

<caption><title>Edge biases in transcript abundance quantification.</title><p>In the figure we illustrate a gene with two transcript isoforms, where only one of them has an 3&#x2019; UTR. Quantification of the transcripts may give a higher TPM to transcript 2 (TPM<sub>2</sub>&#x003E;TPM<sub>1</sub>) due to an excess of reads in the 3&#x0027;UTR. On the other hand, junction reads may give the opposite result. In the figure, according to the junction reads, transcript 1 appears to have greater support. As a consequence, the PSI calculation according to junction reads will give a high inclusion to the alternative exon, i.e. &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> &#x223C; 1. On the other hand, since the transcript that skips the exon gets larger quantification, i.e. TPM<sub>2</sub>&#x003E;TPM<sub>1</sub>, PSI calculation based on transcript expression would give the opposite behaviour, i.e. &#x03A8;<sub>j</sub> &#x003C;&#x003C; 1.
