<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a pathogen that poses one of the greatest threats to human health, causing pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Here, we investigated the evolutionary selective pressures on 16 pneumococcal choline-binding cell-surface proteins. Phylogenetic and molecular analyses revealed that the <italic>cbpJ</italic> and <italic>lytA</italic> genes had the highest codon rates under negative selection among those examined. Although LytA is an important virulence factor inducing pneumococcal autolysis, the role of CbpJ in pneumococcal pathogenesis is unknown. We therefore examined whether CbpJ acts as a virulence factor <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In neutrophil bactericidal assays, the <italic>cbpJ</italic> mutant showed reduced survival as compared to wild-type (WT) <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Mice intranasally infected with a <italic>cbpJ</italic> mutant strain showed a lower bacterial burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and higher survival rate than those infected with WT cells, whereas no differences were observed between strains by intravenous infection. Thus, molecular evolutionary analysis is a powerful tool that reveals the importance of virulence factors in real-world infection and transmission, since calculations are performed based on bacterial genome diversity following transmission of infection in an uncontrolled population. In addition, evolutionarily conserved virulence factors are candidate therapeutic targets or vaccine antigens.</p>

<p>Improper use of antibiotics creates evolutionary pressures that drive bacteria to acquire drug resistance by natural mutation and/or horizontal transfer of resistance genes. This is a major public health threat: it is estimated that drug-resistant infections cause 10 million deaths annually and may result in economic losses reaching 100 trillion US dollars by 2050<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. However, a target-to-hit screen typically requires 24 works-in-process and 94 million US dollars, and the baseline total cost is 1.8 billion US dollars over 13 years to launch a new drug<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In fact, the number of new antibiotics developed and approved has steadily decreased in the past three decades, leaving fewer options for treating resistant bacteria<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is one of the pathogens posing the greatest threat to human health<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> belongs to the mitis group<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and is a major cause of pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In 2015, pneumococcal pneumonia caused over 1.5 million deaths in individuals of all ages, and this rate increased in people over 70 years old between 2005 and 2015<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, which is especially problematic since the elderly population is growing in many parts of the world. Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have considerable benefits, non-vaccine pneumococcus serotypes have increased worldwide<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The conflict between the host immune system and pathogens leads to an evolutionary arms races known as the &#x201C;Red Queen&#x201D; scenario<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Protein regions at the host-pathogen interface are subjected to the strongest selective pressure and thus evolve under positive selection. Adaptive evolution has been reported in genes related to the mammalian immune system such as pattern recognition receptors<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, bacterial proteins are under negative/purifying selection, which is important for the survival and/or success of the species since non-synonymous substitution of codons can lead to lineage extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses can reveal the number of codons under negative/purifying selection in a species, since alterations in amino acid residues in regions under negative selective pressure are not allowed. Thus, drugs targeting these regions would be less likely to promote the development of resistance through natural mutation.</p>

<p>We analysed pneumococcal choline-binding proteins (CBPs) localised on the bacterial cell surface through interaction with choline-binding repeats and phosphoryl choline on the cell wall. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> harbours various CBPs including <italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramoyl <sc>L</sc>-alanine amidase (LytA), which induces pneumococcal-specific autolysis<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Although several CBPs have been characterised, their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear and the unclassified gene names are confusing. We first analysed the distribution of genes encoding CBPs based on pneumococcal genome sequences. Orthologues of genes in each strain were identified by phylogenetic analysis. We then calculated the evolutionary selective pressure on each codon from phylogenetic trees and aligned sequences. We found that the <italic>cbpJ</italic> gene contains the highest rate of codons under negative selection. CbpJ has no known functional domains except signal sequences and choline-binding repeats, and its role in pneumococcal pathogenesis is unclear. Functional analyses revealed that CbpJ contributes to evasion of host neutrophil-mediated killing in pneumococcal pneumonia. Thus, evolutionary analysis focusing on negative selection can reveal novel virulence factors.</p>

<title>Distribution of <italic>cbp</italic> genes among pneumococcal strains</title>
<p>Genes encoding CBPs among pneumococcal strains were extracted by tBLASTn search (Supplementary Table 1). Some genes were re-annotated since the search results showed that certain homologous regions were not matched to annotated open reading frames (ORFs). In strain SPNA45, the <italic>SPNA_01670</italic> gene contains both predicted promoter regions and intact ORF structures of the <italic>cbpF</italic> and <italic>cbpJ</italic> genes. On the other hand, <italic>cbpG</italic>-homologous regions in strains R6, D39, SPN034183, SPN994038, and SPN994039 did not contain promoters (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Orthologous relationships of each gene were analysed. The distribution of <italic>cbp</italic> genes was unrelated to capsular serotypes. Four genes&#x2014;i.e., <italic>lytA, lytB, cbpD</italic>, and <italic>cbpE</italic>&#x2014;were conserved as intact ORFs in all 28 pneumococcal strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Other <italic>cbp</italic> genes contained frameshift mutations in the orthologues or were absent in some strains.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic relationships in pneumococcal CBPs</title>
<p>Phylogenetic relationships of genes encoding CBPs in pneumococcal species are confusing since some genes in the same cluster show high similarity to each other. To clarify the relationships, we compared common nucleotide sequences among genes encoding CBPs in strain TIGR4. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses revealed two common clusters: one comprising <italic>cbpF, cbpG, cbpJ, cbpK</italic>, and <italic>cbpC</italic>, and the other <italic>lytA, lytB, lytC, cbpL</italic>, and <italic>cbpE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1). The names of some CBP genes were not consistent with those of phylogenetically related genes. In particular, <italic>cbpF, cbpG, cbpJ</italic>, and <italic>cbpK</italic> were located close to each other in pneumococcal genomes and showed high similarity. We thus defined orthologous genes in each pneumococcal strain based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2). The gene locus tag numbers in orthologous relationships are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The sequence similarity of <italic>cbpF, cbpG, cbpJ</italic>, and <italic>cbpK</italic> and their close proximity within genomes indicated that a common ancestral <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> acquired the genes by gene duplication. Phylogenetic trees showed well-separated clusters of each gene. These independent relationships indicated that horizontal gene transfer did not contribute to the spread of <italic>cbpF, cbpG, cbpJ</italic>, and <italic>cbpK</italic> in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> species, despite their ability to take up exogenous DNA. The genetic diversity of these genes may have been established by accumulation of natural mutations during pneumococcal transmission.</p>

<title>Evolutionary selective pressures on each of the CBP codons</title>
<p>To evaluate the significance of CBPs in real-life infection and transmission, we performed molecular evolutionary calculations based on bacterial genome diversity established after transmission of infection in an uncontrolled population. The nucleotide sequences of each CBP were aligned by codon, and conserved common codons were used for phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3). The selective pressure on each gene was calculated based on the phylogenetic trees and aligned sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The rates of codons under negative selection are shown in Supplementary Figure 4. Over 13&#x0025; of total codons in <italic>cbpJ</italic> and <italic>lytA</italic> genes were under negative selection as compared to less than 5&#x0025; for other <italic>cbp</italic> genes, indicating that these genes play an important role in the success of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> species. On the other hand, the <italic>pspA</italic> gene encoding the genetically divergent virulence factor PspA contained fewer evolutionarily conserved codons, but had the highest numbers of codons under positive pressure. Additionally, there were no evolutionarily conserved codons in the <italic>cbpG, cbpC</italic>, and <italic>cbpL</italic> genes. The latter two had no common codons since a few genes had frameshift mutations. When we re-calculated selective pressure without these genes, we found a low rate of codons under negative selection among CBP-encoding genes (Supplementary Table 3).</p>

<title>CbpJ acts as a virulence factor in pneumococcal pneumonia</title>
<p>While CbpJ had the highest rate of codons under negative selection among pneumococcal CBPs, it has no known functional domains except a choline-binding repeat in its amino acid sequence; moreover, its role in pneumococcal pathogenesis is unknown. In contrast, CbpL showed limited numbers of evolutionarily conserved codons even after the above-described adjustment. Domain structures and codons of CbpJ and CbpL under negative selection are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. To assess the roles of CbpJ and CbpL in pneumococcal pathogenesis, we generated mutant strains deficient in the corresponding genes. We first performed a blood bactericidal assay to investigate the role of CbpJ and CbpL in sepsis. The survival rates of <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic> and <italic>&#x0394;cbpL</italic> strains in mouse blood were comparable to that of the wild-type (WT) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We also carried out a human neutrophil bactericidal assay without serum. Strain <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic> had a lower survival rate than the WT. These results suggest that CbpJ contributes to the evasion of neutrophil-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>In a mouse intravenous infection model, the survival rates of <italic>&#x0394;cbpL</italic>- and <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic>-infected mice did not differ significantly from that of mice infected with WT <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also found that incubation of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in human plasma for 3 h inhibited the expression of <italic>cbpL</italic> and <italic>cbpJ</italic>, as determined by quantitative real-time (q)PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). On the other hand, mice intranasally infected with strain <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic> showed an improved survival rate as compared to those infected with WT <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>; although a similar tendency was observed for &#x0394;cbpL-infected relative to WT mice, the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The number of bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic>-infected mice was lower than that in BALF from <italic>&#x0394;cbpL</italic>- and WT-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). We also examined whether CbpL or CbpJ contributes to the association of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to alveolar epithelial cells and found that WT <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> as well as <italic>&#x0394;cbpL</italic> and <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic> mutant strains did not differ in their ability to adhere to A549 human alveolar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>). However, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> WT strain exhibited extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and bleeding as compared to the <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic> strain. Histological examination of lung tissue from intranasally-infected mice showed that <italic>&#x0394;cbpJ</italic> induced milder inflammation than the WT strain. Lung tissue from <italic>&#x0394;cbpL</italic>-infected mice showed moderate inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5F</xref>). These results indicate that CbpJ acts as a pneumococcal virulence factor in lung infection by contributing to the evasion of neutrophil-mediated killing, whereas CbpJ has no role in bacterial survival in blood. In addition, <italic>cbpL</italic> deficiency in strain TIGR4 did not significantly attenuate pathogenesis in mouse lung and blood infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated evolutionarily conserved rates of CBP codons since these cell surface proteins directly interact with the external environment, which induces rapid rates of evolution in genes involved in genetic conflicts<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Evolutionary analysis based on phylogenetic relationships can reveal regions in which the encoded amino acids are not allowed to change even under selective pressure. The genetic diversity of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> isolated from patients was the result of transmission in a real population. Thus, the evolutionary conservation rate is a parameter that reflects the importance of the protein in human infection. Although so-called arms races involve both the host and bacteria, most studies of genetic diversity have focused on the former<sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. For example, evolutionary studies based on inter-species comparisons have shown that most of the positive selection targets in host receptors are located in regions that are responsible for direct interactions with pathogens. Our study focused on negative selection targets in bacterial surface proteins through an evolutionary analysis based on intra-species comparisons. This approach enabled us to estimate the contribution of bacterial proteins to species success throughout the life cycle, including inside the host and during the transmission phase.</p>
<p>We previously detected bacterial virulence factors by function prediction&#x2014;e.g., by searching for conserved motif/domains, constructing random transposon libraries, or analysing the biochemical properties of the pathogen<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Although these laboratory-based approaches are valuable, they are time-consuming and costly, and may not yield the expected results. It is useful to examine the correlation between a target molecule and clinical features as this can minimise the time and cost required for analysis. Furthermore, in basic studies of bacterial pathogens, animal infection models are often used to determine whether a bacterial molecule acts as a virulence factor. Although this is the best means of obtaining <italic>in vivo</italic> information, it is unclear how accurately it reflects the clinical condition in humans. Combining an evolutionary analysis and an animal model would be highly effective for evaluating the functional significance of a putative virulence factor.</p>
<p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful tool for identifying the relationship between genetic variants&#x2014;mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)&#x2014;and phenotype, such as in diseases. As GWAS has become more prevalent, various programs and software packages have been developed for this purpose<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. On the other hand, this approach has certain limitations, including the requirements for an appropriate control group and detailed information regarding phenotype. In infectious diseases, it can be difficult to quantify clinical features recorded at different medical centres. Furthermore, in the case of most pathogens, there are no natural attenuated or avirulent strains that can serve as a control group. Our evolutionary analysis has the advantage that it can be performed with genomic information of pathogenic strains only by assuming the presence of pathogens as a phenotype evading natural selection. Since synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions are estimated to occur with equal probability under no selective pressure, a population in which the latter has resulted in extinction by natural selection can serve as a control group. While we have shown in the current study that evolutionary analysis with a small population has the power to detect evolutionarily conserved proteins, a larger population would allow a higher-resolution analysis, including the detection of conserved regions in some pathogenic strains isolated from a specific site of infection or pathological condition. Since this analysis involves simultaneous processing of aligned nucleotide and amino acid sequences, more information is obtained from only SNPs extracted from nucleotide sequences. In addition, automatised phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses are needed to analyse a large population. Therefore, the development of software packages for meta-data is expected to aid widespread application of this analytical approach.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to our evolutionary analysis. Firstly, although it can detect evolutionarily conserved proteins, it cannot identify diverse virulence factors such as PspA and CbpA within species<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Similarly, virulence factors recently acquired by horizontal gene transfer have not been under selective pressure for a sufficiently long period of time to perform this analysis. In addition, the high rate of codons under negative selection indicate their universal importance in bacterial species. In other words, a molecule under relaxed selective pressure could contribute to the virulence of some populations of the species. However, these features of molecular evolutionary analysis can be advantages when screening for therapeutic target sites or vaccine antigens with a low frequency of missense mutations, which could reduce the virulence or survivability of the pathogen. Evolutionary analysis could also be an effective alternative strategy for overcoming drug resistance through antigen replacement, and could reduce costs associated with drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>The <italic>lytA</italic> gene, which was conserved among virtually all pneumococcal strains, showed the highest rates of codons under negative selection, except for the <italic>cbpJ</italic> gene that was only present in some strains. LytA is known to induce pneumococcal-specific autolysis<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and contributes to pneumococcal virulence<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Our evolutionary analysis supports previous reports that the <italic>lytA</italic> gene is a suitable genetic marker<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> due to its evolutionary conservation. We also showed that the <italic>pspA</italic> and <italic>cbpA</italic> genes contain relatively high rates of codons under positive selection, and both encode polymorphic virulent proteins <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> that are candidate vaccine antigens, although the genes are not universally present within a global serotype 1 collection<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In addition, selective pressure by vaccines can easily cause differentiation or deficiency of these proteins since the corresponding genes contain few codons under negative selection. A multivalent system would be required for vaccines using these antigens.</p>
<p>Although the difference was not statistically significant, mice intranasally infected with TIGR4 <italic>&#x0394;cbpL</italic> strain showed a trend towards improved survival relative to the WT-infected mice. In a previous study, a D39<italic>lux cbpL</italic>-deficient strain showed reduced virulence as compared to the WT strain<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Since CbpL sequences in TIGR4 and D39 strains are similar, the discrepancy between the previous study and our findings is likely due to differences in other surface proteins in each strain. For example, the absence of CbpJ, which contributes to the evasion of neutrophil killing, could affect the survivability of D39.</p>
<p>Recently, antivirulence drugs have been developed as an additional strategy to treat or prevent bacterial infections. Drugs targeting bacterial virulence factors are expected to reduce the selective pressure of conventional antibiotics since they would not affect the natural survival of targeted bacteria<sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the abundance of candidate targets is a major advantage of antivirulence strategies. Effective design of vaccines and antivirulence drugs requires a thorough understanding of virulence factors; combining our evolutionary analysis and traditional molecular microbiological approaches can improve the detection of potential drug targets. In this study, we identified CbpJ as a novel evolutionarily conserved virulence factor. Thus, molecular evolutionary analysis is a powerful system that can reveal the importance of virulence factors in real-world infections and transmission.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses</title>
<p>Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses were performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. Homologues and orthologues of <italic>cbp</italic> genes were searched using the tBLASTn function of NCBI BLAST. Bacterial ORFs and promoters were predicted by FGENESB (Bacterial Operon and Gene Prediction) and BPROM, respectively<sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. To prevent node density artefacts, sequences with 100&#x0025; identity were treated as the same sequence in Phylogears2<sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.

Calculated orthologous regions were used for further phylogenetic analysis, and edited codon sequences were re-aligned using MAFFT with an L-INS-i strategy. The best-fitting codon evolutionary models for MrBayes and RAxML analyses were determined using Kakusan4<sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses were performed with MrBayes v.3.2.5<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, and 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> generations were sampled after confirming that the standard deviation of split frequencies was &#x003C; 0.01 for up to 8 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> generations. To validate phylogenetic inferences, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees with bootstrap values were generated with RAxML v.8.1.20<sup><xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.

For human neutrophil isolation, blood was collected via venopuncture from healthy donors after obtaining written, informed consent according to a protocol approved by the institutional review board of Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry (H26-E43). Neutrophils were isolated from fresh human blood by density gradient centrifugation using Polymorphprep (Alere Technologies, Jena, Germany). Pneumococcal cells grown to the mid-log phase were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Bacterial cells (1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/20 &#x03BC;l) were combined with fresh mouse blood (180 &#x03BC;l) or human neutrophils (2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/180 &#x03BC;l), and the mixture was incubated at 37&#x00B0;C in 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> for 1, 2, and 3 h.
