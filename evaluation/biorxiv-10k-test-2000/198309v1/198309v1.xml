<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Earlier, prominent occurrences of interstitial loss-of-heterozygosities (LOHs) were found in different cancers as a type of single-nucleotide-variations (SNVs), at rates far exceeding those of the commonly investigated gain-of-heterozygosities (GOHs) type of SNVs. Herein, such co-occurrences of LOHs and GOHs were confirmed in 102 cases of four cancer types analyzed with three different next-generation sequencing platforms, comparing non-tumor, paratumor, and tumor tissues with white-blood-cell controls; and in 246 pan-cancer cases of whole-genome tumor-control pairs. Unexpectedly, large numbers of SNVs enriched with CG&#x003E;TG GOHs and copy-number-variations (CNVs) proximal to these GOHs were detected in the non-tumor tissues, which were extensively reversed in paratumors showing prominent TG&#x003E;CG LOHs with proximal CNVs, and less so in tumors to form forward-reverse mutation cycles. Lineage effects in the reversions, likely resulting from directional selection, supported a sequential rather than parallel mode of evolution as described in a &#x2018;Stage Specific Populations&#x2019; model of cancer development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The progressive development of cancer has been investigated at the cytochemical and genetic levels<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and the existence of early premalignant stages in the process has been suggested by precancer manifestations in terms of DNA, gene expression, protein and microscopic changes<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Genomic analysis has played an increasingly important role toward delineation of mutational events<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and a recent study by us has led to the finding of massive single-base interstitial loss-of-heterozygosities (LOHs) in various types of cancers, pointing to widespread intersister chromosomal gene conversions arising from defective DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in tumor development<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Thus the interplay between the gain-of-heterozygosity (GOH) and LOH types of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) requires examination along with copy number variations (CNVs) as mutational elements of cancer regarding the extent of possible reversion of forward mutations during cancer development.</p>
<p>In the present study, non-tumor, paratumor, primary tumor and metastatic tumor tissues in different types of solid tumors were compared with same-patient white-blood-cell controls based on massive parallel sequencing. Somatic mutations in both directions, <italic>i.e.</italic> GOHs, LOHs, CNV gains and CNV losses were examined residue-by-residue and window-by-window in order to detect the presence of mutation reversals in the development of cancer cells and to assess their biological significance. The results obtained suggested that forward-reverse cycles of mutations along with directional selection are important determinants of stage-specific cell population profiles in cancer development.</p>

<title>Genotypic changes in non-tumor and paratumor tissues</title>
<p>White-blood-cells (B), tumor tissue (T), paratumor tissue (P) immediately adjacent to tumor, and more remote non-tumor tissue (N) were collected in twelve same-patient tetra-sample cases consisted of four breast carcinomas (BRCA), five stomach adenocarcinomas (STAD) and three hepatocellular carcinomas (LIHC) (Supplementary Table 1), and subjected to DNA analysis using the AluScan platform based on inter-Alu polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by massively parallel sequencing (MPS) as described in Methods. The genotype of a base residue was referred as a major allele (M) when it matched the genotype on human reference genome hg19, or as a minor allele (m) when there was no match, thereby enabling the identification of changes in the form of MM-to-Mm GOH (&#x2018;GOH-M&#x2019;), mm-to-Mm GOH (&#x2018;GOH-m&#x2019;), Mm-to-MM LOH (&#x2018;LOH-M&#x2019;) or Mm-to-mm LOH (&#x2018;LOH-m&#x2019;)<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a</xref> and 1b show the total number of residue-by-residue changes in the N-, P- or T-sample genomes relative to B-sample, <italic>viz.</italic> &#x0394;NB, &#x0394;PB or &#x0394;TB respectively in terms of GOH-M, GOH-m and LOH (sum of instances of LOH-M and LOH-m). Since the numbers of GOH-M, GOH-m and LOH mutations were higher in &#x0394;NB than in &#x0394;TB, and comparable in &#x0394;PB and &#x0394;TB, both the N-sample and P-sample cells had to be regarded as premalignant or early malignant cells despite their normal morphology and expression of immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers, in contrast with T-sample cells showing enlarged nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and reduced expression of IHC markers (Supplementary Table 1). Notably, a forward-reverse mutation cycle (FR-cycle) was commonly observed in the patch diagrams in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>: GOHs were strongly reversed by LOHs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, G1 mutations reversed by L1 mutations), and LOHs strongly reversed by GOHs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, L14 reversed by G12). Moreover, the LOH mutations of Mm residues displayed pronounced lineage effects, favoring the formation of MM residues when the Mm residues themselves were derived from MM residues, but favored the formation of mm residues when the Mm residues were derived from mm residues (as in the LOH mutations highlighted by yellow triangles in the figure).</p>

LOH represents the sum of LOH-M and LOH-m changes.

Subgroups of contexts are compartmentalized by vertical dashed lines. Since residues of minor bases different from &#x201C;m&#x201D; were rare in the samples analyzed, mutations involving them are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 but not shown in the patch diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1b</xref>, 3b and 4b.

<p>Notably, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> right panel, partition of germline Mm residues via LOH steps L13 and L14 yielded a greater MM/mm product ratio than partition via LOH steps L15 and L16, and greater still than partition via LOH steps L21 and L22, although in each instance MM products exceeded mm products (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Since all these three successive partitions emanated from germline Mm residues, their diminishing MM/mm ratios could not be the consequence of lineage effects. Instead, because MM residues in the genome generally have been optimized for growth by prolonged evolution, they tend to be favored over mm residues. Accordingly, the finding of [L13/L14] &#x003E; [L15/L16] &#x003E; [L21/L22] plausibly could be the result of a longer period of positive selection for MM over mm products of LOH in the N-stage cells relative to P-stage cells, and likewise P-stage cells relative to T-stage cells, suggesting that MM was generally preferred over mm for optimized growth of cells.</p>

<p>When the trinucleotide-based mutational profile method<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> was employed to classify the GOHs and LOHs observed in the B-N-T-P tetra samples into the C&#x003E;A, C&#x003E;G, C&#x003E;T, T&#x003E;A, T&#x003E;C and T&#x003E;G groups, the results showed that C&#x003E;T and T&#x003E;C mutations were particularly prominent among both GOHs and LOHs, in keeping with the general expectation that transitions exceed transversions in SNVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). The C&#x003E;T GOHs among the &#x0394;NB changes displayed peak frequencies at the four NCG triplets, conforming to the &#x2018;Signature 1A&#x2019; (marked by four solid arrowheads) common to cancers, and likely ascribable to the contribution of spontaneous deaminations of 5-methyl-cytosine at methylated CpG to form thymidine<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. These deaminations would also explain the &#x02DC;50&#x0025; greater occurrence of C&#x003E;T GOHs than T&#x003E;C GOHs in the &#x0394;NB changes.

<title>Evidence from mutational profiles for gene conversions in LOH production</title>
<p>For the &#x0394;TB SNVs of Pilot-63 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>), the alteration-group plots of mutational profile in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> revealed strikingly similar heights for the opposing C&#x003E;T (blue) and T&#x003E;C (pink) LOH bars in the right panel, but not for the opposing C&#x003E;T (blue) and T&#x003E;C (pink) GOH bars in the left panel, consistent with excess LOHs than GOHs. The context-group plots in Supplementary <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> show comparable rates for all pairs of opposing LOHs in contrast to the unequal rates for the opposing GOHs. The mutation-rate diagrams in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref> show the actual rates for all opposing GOH pairs and LOH pairs. These results are summarized in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>, where over 61&#x0025; of the rate ratios of opposing substitutions were greater than two for the GOHs (blue bars), but 100&#x0025; were between one and two for the LOHs (striped red bars), supporting different underlining mechanisms for GOH and LOH. This divergence of the rate ratios between opposing GOHs and opposing LOHs was in accord with our proposal that the LOHs in cancer cells resulted mainly from DSB repairs through gene conversions<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In a DSB at a heterozygous C/T, gene conversion could yield either a C/C or T/T homozygous position at comparable rates, depending on which homologous chromatid bears the DSB. On the other hand, because GOHs depend on point mutations rather than gene conversions, this comparable-rate constraint would not apply to GOHs.</p>

<title>Distances between SNVs and recurrent CNVs</title>
<p>That the N-stage SNVs and CNVs in the B-N-P-T tetra samples both underwent active reversions, and more in P-stage than in T-stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) suggest some form of possible correlation between these two types of mutations.

<title>Frequency classes of serial CNV changes</title>
<p>In the B-N-P-T tetra-sample cases, the status of any CNV in the N-, P- and T-stages could be CN-unaltered (U), CN-gain (G) or CN-loss (L) relative to its status in B-stage. Arranging in serial order, the CN-status found in the N-P-T stages (Supplementary Tables 5) yielded twenty-six different serial orders, and their frequencies fell into three classes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7a</xref> and 7b). In the LUG order, for example, each CNV site was CN-loss in N-stage, CN-unaltered in P-stage and CN-gain in T-stage, and the total number of sequence windows in the B-N-P-T sequences analyzed that exhibited such an LUG order made up the frequency on the y-axis of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>.

The CN-status of 500-kb windows of N-, P- or T-stage was determined relative to B-stage for twelve B-N-P-T tetra samples as described in Methods. The total numbers of windows that conformed to the different possible serial orders of CN changes (Supplementary Table 11) provided the basis for their partition into three frequency classes (separated by two vertical dashed lines).

<p>The plausible basis for these different classes could be straightforward: the CNV orders in Class I entailed minimal copy-number departures from the starting B-stage, and were therefore well tolerated; in comparison, the Class II of CNV orders incurredgreater departures from U and were less well tolerated. Every CNV order in the Class III involved at least one double-dose change jumping either from G to L or from L to G between two successive stages of cancer development, a distinct disadvantage that led to their lowest frequencies.</p>
<p>The double-dose disadvantage explained the low frequencies of GLU, LGU, UGL, ULG, LGL, GLG, LGG, GGL, GLL and LLG, but not the low frequencies of LUG and GUL which fell into Class III even though they did not incur any double-dose copy number changes, in contrast to GUG and LUL which belonged to the more abundant Class II. The contrast indicates that lineage effects were important not only to LOH-partitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref>, 3b and 4b), but also to the frequencies of different CNV orders. In GUG, the G status of T-stage cells constituted a reversion to the G status of N-stage cells. In LUL, the L status of T-stage cells likewise constituted a reversion to the L status of the N-stage cells. Thus, both these reversions were favored by lineage effects, allowing GUG and LUL to join Class II even though they each incurred two CNV-status changes. In contrast, lineage effects acted against LUG and GUL, because the CNV-status of the T-stage cells in these cases was not a restoration of the CNV-status of the N-stage cells, thereby explaining their diminished frequencies. These lineage effects were observable when different sizes of sequence windows were employed for CNV identification: as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, both the quotients (Q-value) of GUG/GUL and LUL/LUG greatly exceeded unity (marked by dashed red line), yielding significant lineage effects of <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>-16</sup> for all sizes of sequence windows ranging from 50-500kb.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, genomic sequence analysis employing the AluScan platform revealed that the paratumor region at &#x003C;2cm from tumor&#x2019;s edge and the non-tumor tissue region at &#x003E;2cm from tumor (see Methods) contained numerous GOH and LOH types of SNVs along with CNVs that pointed to these regions as premalignant or early malignant stages in cancer development despite their apparently normal cell morphologies. Residue-by-residue tracing of these mutations through the B-, N-, P- and T-stages pointed to much higher LOH rates and GOH-m rates than GOH-M rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) in accord with our earlier findings<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In addition, prevalence of FR mutation cycles was observed with strong lineage effects in the partition of LOHs between MM and mm products (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and in the steeply unequal CNV frequencies between GUG and GUL and between LUL and LUG (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). These findings based on the BN-P-T tetra samples, and supported by those from the B-N-T trio samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), the N-T-M trio samples based on AluScan, WES and WGS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and ICGC B-T paired samples based on WGS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) pointed to a cancer development sequence in the order of B-N-P-T, as represented in the Stage Specific Population (SSP) Model in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>, in accord with the greater distance of the N-region than the P-region from the tumor. In this SSP model, while each of the N-, P- and T-stage cell populations could comprise multiple cell clones, a majority of the cell clones within the same stage would display largely similar mutational and morphological characteristics.</p>

<p><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref> shows that although the twelve B-N-P-T tetra-sample cases were derived from three types of solid tumors, they all displayed a largely similar mutational profile: the SNVs found at N-stage (&#x03C3;<sub>N</sub>) comprised different proportions of GOHs (red) and LOHs (orange), and underwent substantial reversions in P-stage cells, followed by a much smaller number of additional reversions occurring in the T-stage cells. Altogether, that more N-stage SNVs were reversed in P-stage than in T-stage in all twelve samples amounted to a highly non-random observation (<italic>p</italic> = 3.1&#x00D7;10<sup>-12</sup>), in confirmation of the stage-specific difference in mutational activities between P- and T-stage cells. Overall, the numbers of forward SNVs decreased in P-stage compared to N-stage, and decreased even further in T-stage. The forward N-stage GOHs and LOHs underwent strong reversals in the P-stage, and far less so in T-stage. On the other hand, the forward P-stage GOHs and LOHs were strongly reversed in T-stage (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>). The huge difference between the numbers of forward N-stage GOHs and LOHs reversed in P-stage and the numbers of forward N-stage GOHs and LOHs reversed in T-stage clearly attested to the highly dissimilar mutational activities of the N-, P- and T-stage cells. On account of the importance of microenvironment in carcinogenesis<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, such stage-specific characteristics could arise at least in part from the sharing of a common microenvironment by all cell clones within the same N-, P- or T-stage. The finding of an N-stage cell population characterized by high GOH type of SNVs and normal cell morphology (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>) was consisted with the elevated SNV prevalences by 27-fold (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001) or 36-fold (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001) observed in normal kidney cortices of subjects that were smokers or exposed to the environmental carcinogen aristolochic acid respectively<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, and pointed to the propensity of N-stage cells to carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>The pronounced reversions of N-stage SNVs in P-stage, P-stage SNVs in T-stage, and T-stage SNVs in M-stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref> and 3b) suggest that FR-cycle between successive development stages could be a common cellular evolution strategy for adjustment to the microenvironmental changes encountered during stage transition. In this regard, it is notable that, when a deviant <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> population induced by extreme starvation was allowed to readapt to the ancestral culture environment, reversions of SNPs back to ancestral allele genotypes over fifty generations of evolution amounted to about 50&#x0025;<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, comparable to the average level of SNV-reversions exhibited by P-stage cells in the form of Type-IVa changes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>.</p>
<p>In any event, the wide occurrence of FR-cycles over the N-, P- and T-stages suggests that these stages of cancer development could be burdened with excessive deleterious mutations that require alleviation through reverse mutations to ensure optimal growths. This could help explain the findings of transformed cells multiplying more slowly at low population density than untransformed cells, <italic>e.g.</italic>, upon transformation of a C3H/10T1/2CL8 fibroblast cell line derived from C3H mouse embryos by 3-methylcholanthrene, the transformed cells exhibited a saturation density 2-3 times that of untransformed cells, but generation times of 22 and 27 hours, <italic>viz.</italic> 40-70&#x0025; longer than the 15.5 hours for the untransformed cells<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Likewise, NIH 3T3 cells displayed retarded growth at low density and increased saturation density preceding the formation of transformed loci<sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, while the increased density attained might stem from reduced contact inhibition, and the longer generation times could be the result of excessive deleterious mutations.</p>
<p>The <italic>FRMD4A</italic> gene<sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> was mutated in four BRCA cases and three STAD cases in the twelve tetra-sample cases, and <italic>CAGE1</italic> for cancer antigen 1<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> was mutated in BRCA, STAD as well as LIHC samples. SNVs recurrent in four out of twelve cases were detected for sixteen different genes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). Based on the GOTERM and INTERPRO databases, pathway enrichment analysis show that SNVs in the B-N-P-T tetra samples were frequent in the cell-adhesion and protein kinase pathways (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8e</xref>). It was striking that all of the N-stage mutations in the cadherin N-terminal domain family persisted un-reversely throughout the P- and T-stages, pointing to the importance of this family of cell adhesion molecules at multiple stages of cancer development.</p>
<p>In conclusion, because cancers are driven by mutations, the nature of the mutations in the evolving cancer cells furnishes an appropriate basis for delineating the major stages of carcinogenesis. In the present study, the mutational profiles of the cell populations in the N-, P- and T-stage samples showed that N-stage cells harbored large numbers of SNV mutations, more GOHs than LOHs, which were enriched with NCG&#x003E;NTG type of GOHs with associated CNVs. The P-stage cells displayed, relative to N-stage cells, more LOHs than GOHs. A major fraction of their LOHs represented reversals of the forward GOH mutations found in N-stage, and were enriched with NTG&#x003E;NCG type of LOHs with associated CNVs. In the T-stage cells, the ratio between LOHs and GOHs was even higher than P-stage cells. At T-stage, there were numerous reversals of P-stage mutations but far fewer reversals of N-stage mutations. Such distinct mutational profiles of the different stages gave rise to FR-cycles of mutational changes between N- and P-stages and between P- and T-stages in a sequential SSP model of cancer development that was supported by pronounced lineage effects on the partition of LOHs between MM and mm products (yellow highlighted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref>, 3b and 4b), as well as the relative frequencies of different orders of copy number changes between the N-, P- and T-stages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), which could not be explained by early divergence of different cell clones that subsequently engaged in parallel evolution. While mutations increased diversity and contributed to the formation of stage specific cell populations, directional selection made evident by MM-over-mm preference in LOHs stemming from germline heterozygous sites and the reversal of SNVs and CNVs to their original genotypes, likely on account of the optimization of cell growth and multiplication, was essential in shaping the distinctive mutational landscapes of different stages of cancer development. In this basis, the possibility arises that early N- and P-stage cells which have not yet accomplished their requisite mutation reversals might be relatively deficient in growth and replication vigor, in which case it could be advantageous to target therapeutic interventions at these early stages of cells before they have accomplished their mutation reversals to become fully malignant, therapy-resistant cancers.</p>

The opposing GOH mutations (left panel) or opposing LOH mutations (right panel) are placed side-by-side, <italic>e.g.</italic>, by pairing the ATG&#x003E;ACG GOH (pink bar) with the ACG&#x003E;ATG GOH (blue bar) in Section-3 of left panel, and similarly pairing the ATG&#x003E;ACG LOH (pink bar) with the ACG&#x003E;ATG LOH (blue bar) in Section-3 of right panel (marked by arrowheads and color-coded as in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). (<bold>b</bold>) Mutation-rate diagrams for GOHs. Each of the ten diagrams of triplet duplexes correspond to a context group, labeled 1-10 as in Part <bold>a</bold>. The mutation rates of opposing GOH mutations are labeled on double-headed arrows, except for the single-headed curved arrows in groups 7-10, where the two sequences are identical in a triple duplex. Each double-headed arrows is accompanied by two color-coded mutation rates that correspond to the heights of color-coded bars in Part <bold>a</bold>, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in context group 1, the conversion of double-stranded ACA/TGT to AAA/TTT is associated with a mutation rate of 162, colored red to correspond to the red C&#x003E;A bar with A.A context in the left panel of Part <bold>a</bold>; whereas the opposing conversion of AAA/TTT to ACA/TGT is associated with a mutation rate of 641, colored orange to correspond to the orange A.C bar with A.A context in the left panel of Part <bold>a</bold>. (<bold>c</bold>) Mutation-rate diagrams for LOHs. The arrows employed are similar to those in Part <bold>b</bold>. All arrows in Parts <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold> are shown as dashed lines for transitions (TSs) or solid lines for transversions (TVs). In the ten diagrams in Part <bold>b</bold> or Part <bold>c</bold>, the boxed TS/TV ratio given for each diagram represents the ratio pertaining to all the TS and TV mutations in the diagram, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in Diagram-1 of Part <bold>b</bold>, TS equals the sum of the four TS rates in the diagram, and TV the sum of the eight TV rates, yielding TS/TV = 1430/2804 = 0.51. The different rates in the diagrams in Parts <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold> are color-coded as in Part <bold>a</bold>.</p>
