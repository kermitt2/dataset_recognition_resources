<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Bone metastases (BoM) are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with Estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, yet characterizations of human specimens are limited. In this study, exome-capture RNA-sequencing (ecRNA-seq) on aged (8-12 years), formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and decalcified cancer specimens was first evaluated. Gene expression values and RNA-seq quality metrics from FFPE or decalcified tumor RNA showed minimal differences when compared to matched flash-frozen or non-decalcified tumors. ecRNA-seq was then applied on a longitudinal collection of 11 primary breast cancers and patient-matched <italic>de novo</italic> or recurrent BoM. BoMs harbored shifts to more Her2 and LumB PAM50 intrinsic subtypes, temporally influenced expression evolution, recurrently dysregulated prognostic gene sets and altered expression of clinically actionable genes, particularly in the CDK-Rb-E2F and FGFR-signaling pathways. Taken together, this study demonstrates the use of ecRNA-seq on decade-old and decalcified specimens and defines expression-based tumor evolution in long-term, estrogen-deprived metastases that may have immediate clinical implications.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Bone metastases (BoM) occur in approximately 65-75&#x0025; of breast cancer patients with relapsed disease, resulting in significant comorbidities such as fractures and chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Following colonization to the bone, breast cancer cells exploit the local microenvironment by activating osteoclasts, which in turn provides proliferative fuel for tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This process is targeted clinically using anti-osteoclast agents such as bisphosphonates and RANKL inhibitors, yet these therapies do not confer significant survival benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Importantly, the majority of breast cancers that metastasize to bone are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and present clinically in the context of long-term endocrine therapies such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> models of BoM have unfortunately been somewhat restricted to ER-negative disease due to the more indolent characteristics of ER-positive cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Molecular characterizations of ER-positive specimens that have recurred in an estrogen-deprived system, which represents the major burden of breast cancer BoM, are thus essential to reinforce the significant scientific contributions made using <italic>in vivo</italic> bone metastasis models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, datasets are currently limited, in part due to the practical difficulties of obtaining and processing human BoM specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Large-scale molecular characterizations of patient-matched samples&#x2014;primary tumors and synchronous or asynchronous matched metastases&#x2014;show that metastatic lesions acquire features distinct from primary tumors that are either clinically actionable or confer therapy resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Indeed, current treatment guidelines in breast cancer recommend a biopsy to guide therapy in advanced disease if possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, BoM often undergo harsh decalcification procedures with strong acids to eliminate calcium deposits prior to specimen sectioning. Decalcification degrades nucleic acids and can alter results of immunohistochemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, formalin-fixed paraffin embedding (FFPE)&#x2014;often performed in concert with decalcification&#x2014;causes severe degradation and hydrolysis of RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In light of this, new capture-based methods of nucleic acid sequencing on aged FFPE specimens have shown efficacy in identifying DNA variants and even guiding care in academic centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Exome-capture RNA-sequencing (ecRNA-seq) is less well characterized in aged tumor samples, although recent studies on FFPE specimens have shown promising expression correlations with flash-frozen tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Because of the untapped potential of archived, decalcified BoM specimens, the burden of BoM in breast cancer patients and the lack of long-term endocrine treated tumor datasets, the performance of ecRNA-seq from decade-old, degraded and decalcified tumor samples was first assessed. Following this evaluation, ecRNA-seq was then applied to a collection of 11 ER-positive patient-matched primary breast cancers and bone metastases to define transcriptional evolution in breast cancer cells following metastatic colonization in the bone and years of endocrine therapy.</p>

<title>ecRNA-sequencing of aged and decalcified breast cancers</title>
<p>To determine the feasibility of sequencing an aged, FFPE and decalcified tumor cohort, ecRNA-seq on two separate sample sets was performed. The first sample set included four cases of primary breast tumors that at the time of resection, were split in two. One part was flash-frozen and stored at &#x2212;80 C and the other tumor section was formalin-fixed paraffin embedded and stored at room temperature. Storage times ranged from 8.2 to 12.3 years. Post-alignment RNA-sequencing QC analyses showed differences in GC content and insert size, yet gene body coverage and transcript diversity assignments were largely similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After quantifying and normalizing gene abundances, expression correlations between frozen and FFPE matched samples were assessed using log2normCPM values. <italic>Pearson r</italic> correlations ranged from 0.929 to 0.963, with an average correlation of 0.953 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The same analysis was performed using a second sample set of matched FFPE-decalcified and FFPE-non-decalcified samples. Again, no concerning deviations in RNA-seq quality metrics were observed between the two differently processed sample groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and Pearson <italic>r</italic> expression correlations ranged from 0.936 to 0.969 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, correlation matrices of the two sample sets showed matched tumor sample expression values were more similar to each other than expression values from tumors with equivalent processing and storage (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Full RNA-seq metrics from the QC analysis did reveal differences in some metrics between FFPE and flash-frozen tissue (i.e. splice junction loci number), that may be informative for other applications such as indel mutation calling or isoform detection (Supplementary Data S1 and S2). In summary, ecRNA-seq shows outstanding quality metrics for analysis of aged FFPE and decalcified bone metastases samples.</p>

<title>ecRNA-seq of breast cancer bone metastases</title>
<p>Following the validation of ecRNA-seq, a cohort of 11 ER-positive patient-matched primary tumors and BoMs was acquired through the University of Pittsburgh Health Science Tissue Bank (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Data S3). Abstracted clinical records showed that nearly all patients (10/11) were documented as having received adjuvant endocrine therapy, and bone metastasis free survival ranged from 0 (de novo bone metastasis) to greater than 5 years with the most common site of bone metastasis being the vertebral column. ecRNA-seq was performed on the 22 samples yielding an average readcount of 58,294,593 and an average <italic>Salmon</italic> transcript mapping rate of 92.6&#x0025; (Supplementary Data S4). Consistent with the initial quality control studies above, quality metrics on these samples showed consistent gene body coverage, GC content, insert sizes and transcript diversity regardless of decalcification status (Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Data S5). Furthermore, since samples within the cohort had been surgically excised and banked many years apart, all paired specimens underwent an analysis of shared variants, which confirmed tumor pairs were patient-matched (Supplementary Figure 3).</p>

<title>Clustering and temporal expression shifts</title>
<p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of patient-matched pairs revealed that decalcification of BoMs did not produce independent clades, with 5 of 11 BoM clustering in the same doublet clade as their matched primary (denoted with &#x002A; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, 3 of the 5 doublet clustering cases were de novo metastases. Discrete PAM50 intrinsic subtype assignments were identical in 6 of 11 pairs. 2 pairs switched from LumA to LumB in the metastasis, 1 pair from LumB to LumA, 1 pair from LumB to Her2 and another was classified as Normal subtype in the primary tumor and LumB in the BoM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To obtain more granularity than discrete PAM50 calls, probability scores for each PAM50 subtype were assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and Supplementary Data S6). Her2 and LumB profile gains (defined as a probability gain of &#x003E;10&#x0025; in a matched BoM) were the most common&#x2014; being observed in 4 of 11 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given observed shifts in expression profiles of bone metastases and doublet clustering of de novo bone metastases, temporal influence on transcriptional evolution was analyzed. Pearson <italic>r</italic> correlations between each patient-matched pair using log2normCPM expression values were utilized as a metric for transcriptional similarity. Expression pair similarity was significantly correlated (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = &#x2212;0.864, <italic>p-value</italic> &#x003C; 0.001) with time from primary tumor diagnosis to bone metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentially expressed genes in bone metastases</title>
<p>To determine genes consistently up- or downregulated in bone metastases, a paired DESeq2 differential gene expression analysis was performed. 207 genes were differentially expressed (FDR adjusted <italic>p-value</italic> &#x003C; 0.10)&#x2014;80 genes with increased and 127 genes with decreased expression in bone metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Data S7). Gene ontology analysis was performed to determine biological processes represented in the up- and downregulated gene sets. Generally, genes within osteogenic programs showed the most significant increases in expression while muscle-related, adhesion and motility gene sets were found to be significantly lost in bone metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Data S8, Supplementary Figure 4). Given that a subset of these genes may be mediating therapy resistance and/or distant metastases, single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> were calculated using tumor expression data from patients with long-term outcomes in METABRIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Two separate gene lists were created to build the signatures&#x2014;representing the most significantly upregulated (boneMetSigUp) and downregulated (boneMetSigDown) genes in bone metastases (Supplementary Data S9). Tumors intrinsically expressing higher boneMetSigUp and lower boneMetSigDown ssGSEA scores conferred worse (log-rank <italic>p-value</italic> &#x003C; 0.001) disease-specific survival outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To increase the power of discerning gene expression effects due to long-term estrogen deprivation, a differential gene expression analysis was performed excluding the treatment-na&#x00EF;ve, de novo bone metastases. This yielded a list of 612 differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Data S10), some of which were not detected as differentially expressed with treatment-na&#x00EF;ve de novo bone metastasis cases included.</p>

<title>Dysregulated gene sets and RBBP8 expression loss</title>
<p>To determine pathway level changes in breast cancer bone metastases, a pre-ranked GSEA was performed. All genes were ranked by DESeq2 calculated log2 fold-changes (metastasis vs. primary, Supplementary Data S11) and then analyzed for enrichments using Molecular Signature Database (MsigDB) gene sets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb</ext-link>, H:Hallmark gene sets, C6: Oncogenic signatures)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.This yielded several significantly metastasis-enriched and metastasis-diminished gene sets (FDR <italic>q-val</italic> &#x003C; 0.10, Supplementary Data S12). The three most significantly enriched gene sets in metastases involved E2F transcription factor targets, genes mediating the G2M checkpoint and an experimental perturbation gene set consisting of genes up-regulated with knockdown of <italic>RBBP8</italic> in a breast cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Other upregulated gene sets included hedgehog signaling and gene sets associated with Rb loss and KRAS gains. The three most significantly negatively correlated gene sets consisted of an NFKb/TNF gene set, genes involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and an embryonic development gene set.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Bone is the most common site of distant recurrence for patients with ER-positive breast cancer, yet comprehensive sequencing datasets of endocrine therapy treated, metastatic samples are currently limited. This is in part due the challenge of obtaining tissue, and degradation of nucleic acids caused by decalcification. In this study, we found that aged FFPE and FFPE-decalcified tumors showed highly similar transcript quantification values as matched flash-frozen and FFPE-non-decalcified tumors. As a proof-of-concept, we then applied ecRNA-seq to a cohort of patient-matched primary and bone metastases collected over a period of five years. We identified subtle shifts in intrinsic subtypes and found a strong temporal influence on transcriptional evolution in breast cancer recurrences. Furthermore, we created several differentially expressed gene sets/signatures that are prognostic and point towards acquired <italic>RBBP8</italic> loss, CDK-Rb-E2F and FGFR pathway gains as mediators of ER-positive breast cancer progression. Lastly, we found bone metastases commonly gain or lose expression in clinically actionable genes, which may be distinct from primary tumors.</p>
<p>ecRNA-seq is an effective method for quantifying expression on aged, FFPE and decalcified tumor specimens. Previous work has assessed nucleic acid amplification success, DNA-sequencing and RNA integrity metrics using decalcified samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>; however, a comprehensive analysis of RNA-sequencing, to our knowledge, has not yet been performed. Consistent with only very minor differences between GC content, insert sizes and other QC metrics, gene expression values between aged matched FFPE/flash-frozen and FFPE-decalcified/FFPE-non-decalcified tumors are highly correlated (Pearson <italic>r</italic> range 0.929 &#x2013; 0.969). This study reinforces and should encourage the use of capture-hybridization approaches to sequence RNA from retrospectively collected, low yield, highly degraded and decalcified archival specimens (Supplementary Data S15)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Expanding sample sets and modalities for genome-wide characterization, especially for rare specimen cohorts that may be impractical to obtain prospectively in large numbers, will accelerate translational discoveries.</p>
<p>Given promising results from our evaluation, we applied ecRNA-seq in a proof-of-concept effort to characterize the transcriptome of 11 archival patient-matched ER-positive primary and recurrent metastases&#x2014; 3 cases having treatment-na&#x00EF;ve, <italic>de novo</italic> bone metastases and 8 recurrent cases harboring long-term endocrine-therapy treated metastases. In the recurrent cases, bone metastasis-free survival ranged from 18 to 65 months. Despite a large portion of the bone metastases being decalcified, global transcriptome QC metrics showed similar features (i.e. GC content, insert sizes, gene body coverage and transcript assignment diversity) and no outliers. Consistent with this, unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed no distinct clusters of decalcified samples, with 5 bone metastases clustering in the same doublet clade as their patient-matched primary breast cancer. Interestingly, 3 of these doublet clustering pairs were clinically <italic>de novo</italic>, treatment na&#x00EF;ve bone metastases, implying limited transcriptional evolution from the primary tumor in synchronous metastases. This was further corroborated with a striking negative correlation between patient-matched expression similarity and time to bone metastasis, suggesting metachronous metastases that clinically present later in their treatment course are more dissimilar from their derived primary lesions. Intrinsic subtyping revealed 5 of the 11 cases changed PAM50 subtypes, with 3 cases switching to LumB in the metastasis and another switching to Her2. Subtle Her2 and LumB profile shifts were also the most common when observing continuous PAM50 probability scores, even in samples that remained concordant in their discrete PAM50 assignments. A recent, targeted expression study analyzed PAM50 assignments in 123 matched breast cancer metastases and the authors found similar frequencies of LumB and Her2 acquisitions in ER-positive metastatic tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Given this transcriptional evolution to more LumB and Her2 profiles, a thoughtful reevaluation of therapy selection in the advanced and perhaps the adjuvant setting may be necessary&#x2014;especially considering HER2-targeted therapies are generally reserved for patients with HER2-positive primary disease.</p>
<p>We found 207 genes to be differentially expressed between primary tumors and patient-matched bone metastases. The top upregulated genes belonged to osteogenic gene sets&#x2014;<italic>BGLAP, RANKL, PTH1R</italic> all showing significant expression gains&#x2014;and supports <italic>in vivo</italic> modelling observations of breast cancer osteomimicry and hijacking of the bone microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Downregulated gene sets included genes involved in broad categories such as cellular adhesion, hemidesmosome assembly and epithelium development, pointing towards specific biological programs lost following metastatic colonization. Moreover, when either the upregulated or downregulated genes are expressed coordinately in primary tumors, we found that they confer worse and better outcomes respectively in ER-positive tumors, suggesting some tumors may develop these transcriptional programs early in their evolution. Lastly, a differential expression analysis between endocrine na&#x00EF;ve primary tumors and long-term endocrine treated bone metastases identified a larger list of differentially expressed genes. Importantly, known mediators of endocrine resistance are represented in the list, including dysregulated expression of <italic>Wnt</italic> family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, expression gains in FGFR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, <italic>FOXC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup></italic> and loss of <italic>ESR1</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Notably, many of these genes do not overlap with the differential expression analysis that included the de novo metastases, suggesting expression alterations specific to late recurrent therapy-treated tumors. This non-overlapping gene set included a greater than 2-fold average expression gain of <italic>ABCG2</italic> in therapy-exposed metastases&#x2014;a multidrug resistance protein shown to be active in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>&#x2014;and loss of <italic>CDKN2A</italic>. CDKN2A encodes <italic>p16</italic>, a negative regulator of CDK4/CDK6 and is located on a common somatically deleted region (9p21) in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Given recent success of CDK4/CDK6-inhibiting compounds (palbociclib and ribociclib) in treating ER-positive breast cancers, this recurrent, acquired, metastatic-specific loss of <italic>CDK2NA</italic> is a clinically important observation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Following significant gene-level changes, a gene set enrichment analysis defined enriched and diminished pathways in breast cancer bone metastases. Enriched genes included those involved in G2M checkpoint and E2F targets. Consistent with the observed LumB enrichments, breast cancer cells appear to develop a more proliferative phenotype following bone colonization and the strong enrichment of E2F signature in metastatic disease again highlights the CDK-Rb-E2F pathway as a potential actionable target. Interestingly, another study that utilized a targeted gene expression platform found proliferative gene signatures in ER-positive metastases may be more accurate at predicting overall survival than signatures in the primary tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. A survival analysis for this work was impractical given the small set of patient-matched pairs, but future metaanalyses are warranted to determine if gene expression signatures in metastases are better predictors of overall survival in the advanced setting, especially given the significant transcriptomic shifts observed in this study.</p>
<p>The most significant gene set enriched in bone metastasis was an experimental perturbation gene set involving the knockdown of the tumor suppressor RBBP8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. <italic>RBBP8</italic> (also known as CtIP) binds directly to Rb, mediates cell cycle regulation, helps maintain genomic stability and loss of <italic>RBBP8</italic> incurs tamoxifen resistance and sensitizes breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition <italic>in</italic> vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Concordant with the GSEA analysis, bone metastases have significant expression loss of <italic>RBBP8</italic>, with 45&#x0025; of cases showing a greater than 2-fold decrease in expression. We found low <italic>RBBP8</italic> expression in ER-positive tumors confers poorer disease-specific survival and bone metastasis-free survival outcomes. These observations point to <italic>RBBP8</italic> loss in metastatic breast cancers as being a prime, perhaps therapeutically relevant candidate for further preclinical investigations.</p>
<p>Lastly, considering we have previously shown that brain metastases acquire highly recurrent gains in clinically actionable genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, particularly in HER2, we analyzed the same set of genes in bone metastases. All tumors harbored significant gains and losses, some of which were highly recurrent. <italic>PIK3C2G</italic>, a relatively uncharacterized gene in the PI3K pathway, was the most recurrent gene expression loss. Other notable losses included <italic>ESR1, CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic>&#8212;genes that have already been implicated in endocrine therapy resistance in experimental models. Intriguingly, <italic>GATA3</italic> is one of the most recurrently mutated genes in breast cancer, being particularly enriched in ER-positive disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>GATA3</italic> inhibits breast cancer metastasis in various model systems and given losses of <italic>GATA3</italic> in ER-positive bone metastases are common, further evaluation of <italic>GATA3</italic> as a potentially targetable breast cancer metastasis suppressor gene should be encouraged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Metastatic gains included FGFR family members (<italic>FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR1</italic>), <italic>ALK</italic> and <italic>KDR</italic>&#x2014;all protein products having small molecules currently in clinical trials. Interestingly, some highly recurrent expression gains (i.e. <italic>EPHA3, PTPRD, PDGFRA, PTCH1</italic>) were exclusive to long-term endocrine treated bone metastases suggesting them as prime, clinically actionable candidate mediators of therapy resistance. Collectively, these observations provide yet further evidence of acquired transcriptional programs in metastatic lesions and suggests that precision care in breast cancer should be informed by molecular features of advanced tumors in order to not miss metastatic dependencies acquired in advanced disease.</p>
<p>Although this study points towards ecRNA-seq as being a viable option to characterize the transcriptome of archived, decalcified specimens, there are limitations. Firstly, multiple methods are used for decalcification with varying effects on nucleic acids and we were unaware of this information for the profiled specimens, as it is rarely recorded in clinical notes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Secondly, in primary versus metastatic expression studies, it is difficult to deconvolute expression contributions from tumors versus the altered microenvironment of the distant organ site. To limit these artifacts in this study, regions of high tumor cellularity in the bone metastasis were cored by a trained molecular pathologist for RNA extraction, which is corroborated by RNA-seq derived tumor purity estimates&#x2014;as no significant tumor purity differences between primary and metastatic tumors (Supplementary Data S15) were observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, single-cell sequencing approaches of metastatic tumors will be essential to bring cell-level resolution to transcriptional studies of metastatic tumors. Novel computational methods that deconvolute heterogeneous sample sets, until single-cell sequencing becomes more widely adopted, will also be essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. All of this withstanding, features of the data are encouraging such as patient-matched tumors clustering together, intuitive PAM50 assignments, corroboration of other groups&#x2019; findings and treatment-specific gains and losses. Finally, a limitation of this study is the small sample size. Hopefully, these results will encourage the use of ecRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile other highly degraded samples and begin a collection of genomic data from metastatic or rare tissues for integration. Importantly, de-identified clinical data should be provided alongside the sequencing, as in this study, to allow more fluid merging of datasets and inspire clinical phenotype-driven analyses.</p>
<p>Taken together, this study both validates the use of ecRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile highly degraded RNA from decade-old and decalcified tumor specimens and defines multiple acquired and lost transcriptional programs in ER-positive bone metastases. We highlight acquired changes in the CDK-Rb-E2F and FGFR pathways, particularly relevant given the recent clinical use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, and point towards <italic>RBBP8</italic> as a particularly compelling candidate in breast cancer progression. We also find significant gains in clinically actionable genes that may have not been appreciated in primary tumors, reinforcing the need for longitudinal characterizations of cancer specimens to guide clinical care.</p>

For Kaplan-Meier curves, the logrank test was used to determine statistically significant differences in event probabilities (i.e. death or time to metastasis) based on binary expression or signature strata. For single gene queries, paired Wilcoxon-signed ranked tests on log2normCPM values were used.</p>
