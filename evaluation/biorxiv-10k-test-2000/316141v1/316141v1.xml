<abstract>
<p>Starting from statistical mechanics of polymers and using density functional method, I review theory of polymer brush bilayers at thermal equilibrium thorough a novel point of view. I obtain density profiles, brush heights and interpenetration length in at thermal equilibrium in terms of molecular parameters and distance between brushes. The present work shows witha a transparent analytic approach how polymer brushes balance compression and elasticity when bilayers of brush come into contact. The present results suggest that existing theories about polymer brush bilayers (blob picture) need highly likely to be reviewed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymers are a class of long molecules that consist of repeated units of atoms or molecules i.e. monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The connectivity among monomers in a polymer chain is fulfilled through sharing valance electrons i.e. covalent or molecular bond. Monomers undergoing Brownian motions constantly changes the shape of whole polymer chain so that in long time polymer chain undergoes all possible conformations. Using statistical mechanics and canonical ensemble I review the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a polymer chain.</p>
<p>Polymer brushes are a class of polymeric structures present in many practical situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. They consist of densely grafted polymer chains to surfaces which swell due to steric repulsion among monomers of nearby chains. Polymer brush bilayers are present in a wast majority of biological systems such as mammalian knee joints as lubricant. Polymer brush bilayers are known to inter penetrate which is source of many interesting effect such as shear thinning and lubrication. Getting to know more about polymer brush bilayers improves our knowledge about how to shape future artificial joint technologies.</p>

<title>Polymer in external force</title>
<p>The conformation of a polymer chain changes due to change of monomers position in chain. This situation could be assumed as N vectors of length <italic>a</italic> that are connected together and are free to rotate in three dimensional space. Theoretically, to obtain elastic properties of the chain, we need to apply a force field to the chain and observe its behavior and at the end remove the force field from the resulting quantities. The leading order terms indicate the elastic properties of the chain in absence of force field.</p>
<p>First of all, I introduce Hamiltonian of the system as inner product of force field and all vectors summed up together. The negative sign ensures that the minimum energy takes place when all vectors purely align toward force field. So, the conformations are determined by <italic>&#x03B8;</italic>, the smaller angle between force field and vectors. For simplicity and symmetry considerations, I choose spherical polar coordinates and apply force filed in z direction. So, the angle between force field and vectors is the same as polar angle <italic>&#x03B8;</italic> in spherical polar coordinates.
<disp-formula id="eqn1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Having introduced the Hamiltonian, it will be the next step to calculate partition function which is defined as Z &#x003D; &#x222B; <italic>d</italic>&#x03A9;exp &#x2212;<italic>H</italic>/<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> where &#x03A9; denotes all possible conformations of chain. The partition function turns out to following integral in spherical polar coordinates,
<disp-formula id="eqn2"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The above integral is simply solvable due to uncorrelated vectors (monomers) and it gives the following result for the partition function,
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Having obtained the partition function, we can simply calculate canonical free energy as <italic>F</italic>(<italic>f,T</italic>) &#x003D; &#x2212;<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> log Z(<italic>f</italic>,<italic>T</italic>) giving following expression,
<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>This is the free energy at constant force and temperature. Since, I fixed the force and temperature, so the length of the polymer chain fluctuates. The mean value of the length can be obtained from the canonical free energy as &#x2212;<italic>&#x2202;F</italic>(<italic>f,T</italic>)/<italic>&#x2202; f</italic> which gives us the following length,
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The average length of polymer chain can alternatively be calculated from integration which is equal to above result. As it is observed, the average length of a polymer chain subject to an external force is non-zero. Certainly, this happens exclusively along external force (here z direction) and in other directions (here x and y directions) the average length vanishes. To obtain fluctuations of polymer chain we need to have mean square length i.e. &#x2329;<italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x232A;. Mean square length can be calculated through integration to give following result,
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
and fluctuation in polymer length via &#x2329;<italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x232A; &#x2212;&#x2329;<italic>L</italic>&#x232A; <sup>2</sup> giving following result,
<disp-formula id="eqn7"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn7.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The susceptibility <italic>&#x2202;</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>F</italic>(<italic>f,T</italic>)/<italic>&#x2202; f</italic><sup>2</sup> at fixed force and temperature reads as follows,
<disp-formula id="eqn8"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn8.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>It is interesting to see the behavior of a polymer chain at fixed length and temperature that can be achieved by Helmholtz free energy <italic>A</italic>(<italic>L,T</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>F</italic>(<italic>f,T</italic>) &#x002B; <italic>f</italic>&#x2329;<italic>L</italic>&#x232A; as follows,
<disp-formula id="eqn9"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn9.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In this section, I reviewed the thermodynamics of a polymer chain via statistical mechanical point of view. I obtained exact solutions for thermodynamic quantities. They will get more reliable when we consider asymptotic behaviors of the results which I will do in the nest two sections.</p>

<title>Polymer in weak external force</title>
<p>In many situations, the magnitude of the external force is much smaller than thermal energy. In this limiting case, I can consider the dimensionless quantity <italic>a f</italic> /<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> as much smaller than unity and make Taylor expansion in the physical quantities. The Taylor expansions give us following terms,
<disp-formula id="eqn10"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn10.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The first term in canonical free energy is the free energy of N freely rotating vectors of fixed length a in three dimensional space. The second term is the leading order term in terms of the external force. This term has most of the information about a polymer chain. Looking at <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eqs. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12">12</xref>, we see that this term can be rewritten as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="316141_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. This is a free energy which introduces us elasticity due to entropy in a polymer chain. This term tries to shrink the chain. The inverse compressiblity or susceptibility plays role of spring constant but with a difference to crystals. The elastic constant in solids decreases by temperature but in a polymer and rubber-like materials the elastic constant increases by temperature. So, by heating up the polymers they contract due to &#x2329;<italic>L</italic>&#x232A; &#x003D; <italic>f</italic>/<italic>&#x03BA;</italic><sup>&#x2212;1</sup> in contrast to crystalline materials.
<disp-formula id="eqn11"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn11.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eqs. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn12">12</xref> average length and compressiblity of the chain is seen in weak external force. The leading order term in average length depends on external force so in absence of external force the average length vanishes as it is expected. Naturally, when a polymer chain is subject to an external force, it tends to align to the force direction. This causes non-zero average length which occures in absence of external force.
<disp-formula id="eqn12"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn12.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The leading order term of compressibility is independent of external force. It gives an intrinsic property of polymer chain <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="316141_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> which indicates the elasticity originated from entropy.
<disp-formula id="eqn13"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn13.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The fluctuation of chain length in weak external force is extremely interesting quantity. To understand which term dominates in the perturbation expansion, we need to compare their magnitude. Since the second term is &#x007E; N<sup>2</sup> it appears to dominate the first term but it is multiplied by the perturbation co-efficient squared <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="316141_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. So to see which term dominates we need to make numerical comparison. Typical polymer chains consist N &#x003D; 10<sup>5</sup> monomers and usually force is in order of pN and a monomer has size of 0.1 Nano-meters. Considering order of magnitude of the Boltzmann constant as 10<sup>&#x2212;23</sup> and room temperature <italic>T</italic> &#x003D; 300K, the perturbation coefficient gets <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="316141_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. consequently, the first and the second terms have almost same order of magnitude and both are leading order terms. As it is expected when temperature increases the fluctuations of the chain length increases as well and in extreme limit of <italic>T</italic> &#x2192; &#x221E; then &#x2206;<italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x2192; <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup>N. It means than at very large temperatures, the length fluctuations equals the mean square length. Interestingly, in presence of external force, fluctuations are small compared to mean squared length but in absence of external force, fluctuations equal mean squared length. It means that under the influence of external force, the chain is elongated along the force direction and shows minor fluctuations in length.
<disp-formula id="eqn14"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn14.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The Helmholtz free energy at fixed length and temperature shows that at small external forces, elasticity of a polymer chain is <italic>&#x03BA;</italic><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2329;<italic>L</italic>&#x232A;<sup>2</sup>/2. This is an important result that will be used in the next section as the free energy of a polymer chain.</p>

<title>Polymer in strong external force</title>
<p>Another interesting case is a very strong external force applied to a polymer chain. In this limit, the chain stretches extremely and at sufficiently large forces the chain becomes a line. The behavior of physical quantities under this extreme condition can be seen by making limit of them when external force approaches infinity.
<disp-formula id="eqn15"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn15.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Interestingly, average length goes to N<italic>a</italic> as it is expected from rod limit. The squared length fluctuations goes to N<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x2013; N<sup>2</sup><italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup> as rod limit achieved but this this a negative value and it is an imaginary quantity. Therefore, I would say at rod limit length fluctuations has no real quantity. The susceptibility goes to zero i.e. the elasticity goes to infinity that means a very stiff spring resembling rod limit. Both free energies go to infinity at rod limit.</p>

<title>Polymer brushes</title>
<p>Polymer brushes are composed of linear polymer chains densely grafted to a surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The steric repulsion between monomers of nearby chains swells any chain to collectively form brush-like structure. Here, I review theoretical analysis of polymer brushes through density functional theory. I start from grand potential functional as follows,
<disp-formula id="eqn16"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn16.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The first term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16">Eq. 16</xref> refers to leading order term of Helmholtz free energy which describes elastic energy coming from entropy in chain. Since energy is distributed throughout the chain according to probability distribution function, I multiply Helmholtz free energy by P(<italic>z</italic>) &#x003D; n(<italic>z</italic>)/N. The second term comes from the fact that I assume chain as a monomer gas. This term refers to the first correction to free energy of a gas based on consideration of binary interactions among monomers. Here, <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; (1/2) &#x222B; <italic>d</italic><sup>3</sup><italic>r</italic> (1 &#x2212; exp(&#x2212;U(<italic>r</italic>)/<italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>)) is second virial coefficient that represents strength of binary correlations among monomers. For hard spheres of diameter <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; (2<italic>&#x03C0;</italic>/3)<italic>a</italic><sup>3</sup> independent of temperature. For Lennard-Jones particles <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="316141_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> with <italic>T&#x0304;</italic> &#x003D; <italic>kBT</italic>/<italic>&#x03B5;</italic><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The equilibrium density profile, brush height and chemical potential are to be obtained through simultaneous solution of following three equations. The first equation performs a functional derivative of grand potential with respect to density profile. It leads to a Euler-Lagrange differential equation. The solution of corresponding Euler-Lagrange differential equation results in equilibrium density profile of polymer brush.</p>
<p>The second equation refers to derivative of grand potential with respect to brush height having inserted equilibrium density profile in it. The third equation indicates that total number of monomers in polymer brush is obtained through integration over equilibrium density profile.
<disp-formula id="eqn17"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn17.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>

<title>Polymer brush bilayer</title>
<p>Polymer brush bilayer is a system that is observed in many a wide range of physical systems from biology to industry. The most designated application for polymer brush bilayers is devoted to lubrication inside mammalian joints. To understand theoretically the equilibrium properties of a polymer brush bilayer system, I consider two polymer brushes grafted to two surfaces at <italic>z</italic> &#x003D; 0 and <italic>z</italic> &#x003D; D. I can start from following grand potential where the first integral represents the bottom brush, the second integral represents the top brush and the third integral represents the steric repulsion among monomers of two brushes through interpenetration length. The two brushes are totally same in context of the molecular parameters.
<disp-formula id="eqn19"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn19.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The equations bellow lead to achieve density profiles of each brush, the height of each brush and chemical potentials. I note here that it suffices to take derivative of grand potential with respect to <italic>h</italic> as well as to calculate total monomers of bottom brush for calculations. This becomes possible due to similarity of two brushes.
<disp-formula id="eqn20"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn20.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn20">Eqs. 20</xref> lead to following results for density profiles, heights and chemical potentials. Noting that height of top brush is obtained via D &#x2212;<italic>h</italic> and chemical potentials are same.

where <italic>&#x03B7;</italic> is a length that is defined as follows,
<disp-formula><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Having brush heights an important quantity here is interpenetration length which is obtained as 2<italic>h</italic>&#x2212; D giving following result,
<disp-formula id="eqn22"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="316141_eqn22.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, I present density profiles of polymer brush bilayer, their overlap density profiles and density profile of an isolated brush to see visually how it changes in contact to top brush. I choose <italic>a</italic> &#x003D; 1, <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; 2.09, <italic>&#x03C3;</italic> &#x003D; 0.1, N &#x003D; 30 and D &#x003D; 15. It is seen that brushes compressed due to contact with each other. This is an important point since here we see a balance between elasticity of brushes and compressive force from other brush. Moreover, density profiles in bilayer has less smaller curvature than isolated brush.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>In this report, I reviewed theoretically equilibrium properties of polymer chains with aiming at theoretical description of polymer brush bilayers. I theoretically showed that how polymer brushes interpenetrate in each other through giving exact density profiles of two brushes. I showed theoretically how interpenetration length in polymer brush bilayers depend upon molecular parameters. Interpenetration length decreases by wall distance through a non power law behavior. This suggests that interpenetration length does not obey similarity rules. This is in complete contrast to dependence of interpenetration length upon molecular parameters. All molecular parameters follow similarity rules among them index of polymerization has a major impact and grafting density as well as second virial coefficient have minor impact on interpenetration length. Calculations show that all molecular parameters increase interpenetration length but with different power law. This is interesting, for instance, about second virial coefficient which describes binary correlations among monomers. I have considered all binary interactions the same. One might say that increase in interpenetration length is due to repulsion among monomers inside brushes and not due to repulsion among monomers of different brushes. Consideration of this point can help better understanding this system. I guess if one takes different biary correlations among monomers of different brushes, it will be presented that the correlations among different brushes decreases interpenetration length.</p>
<p>The blob picture which have been utilized in Ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> is seems to be extremely simple and it does not capture important details. For instance, as I showed, the interpenetration length is not independent of binary correlations among monomers and it increases by grafting density, two facts that contradicts results of blob picture. It is worth noting that since in complex systems there are different length and time scales, therefore approaches like blob picture considering only one length scale are not able to deliver sufficient information.</p>
