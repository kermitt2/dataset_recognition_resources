<title>Abstract</title>
<p>2-(3,4-Dichlorophenoxy) triethylamine (DCPTA) regulates many aspects of plant development; however, its effects on soil drought tolerance are unknown. We pre-treated maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) by foliar application of DCPTA and subsequently exposed the plants to soil drought and rewatering conditions during the pre-female inflorescence emergence stage. Exogenous DCPTA significantly alleviated drought-induced decreases in maize yield, shoot and root relative growth rate (RGR), leaf relative water content (RLWC), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Tr), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>), nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>), and soluble protein contents, and nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) activities; increases in the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (Ci), the ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and free amino acid contents, and the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and protease activities. Simultaneously, exogenous DCPTA improved the spatial and temporal distribution of roots and increased the root hydraulic conductivity (Lp), flow rate of root-bleeding sap and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> delivery rates. Moreover, Exogenous DCPTA protected the chloroplast structure from drought injury. Taken together, our results suggest that exogenous DCPTA mitigates the repressive effects of drought on N metabolism and subsequently enhances drought tolerance during the pre-female inflorescence emergence stage of maize.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Crops are frequently exposed to drought during the growth period because of limited and erratic rainfall patterns due to global climate change, which leads to restrictions on agricultural productivity worldwide (Trenberth <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014). Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.), an essential component of global food security, is widely cultivated around the word. The majority of the cultivated area of maize is almost wholly rain-fed and experiences sporadic drought and rewetting cycles (Nuccio <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015). However, maize is considered to be a drought-sensitive crop and loses approximately 1/4 potential yield annually due to drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ziyomo and Bernardo, 2013</xref>). By 2050, the world population will reach 9 billion people, resulting in a high demand for maize (projected to double); furthermore, at that time, drought will severely restrict crop growth for more than 50% of the cultivated land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schiermeier, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To stabilize and increase global crop production to satisfy the demand of the globally burgeoning population, it is imperative to design agronomic research to improve maize performance under drought stress (Zhao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018). The application of plant growth regulators has been considered an effective way to enhance crop drought resistance (Ali <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). Multiple investigations have indicated that a tertiary amine bioregulator known as 2-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy) triethylamine (DCPTA) regulates many aspects of plant development; for example, DCPTA promotes plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keithly <italic>et al.,</italic> 1990a</xref>), enlarges chloroplast volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Keithly <italic>et al.,</italic> 1990b</xref>), enhances photosynthetic enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wan and Mendoza, 1992</xref>), accelerates CO<sub>2</sub> fixation (Gausman <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985), and stimulates carotenoid biosynthesis (Benedict <italic>et al.,</italic> 1985). As far as we know, very few studies of DCPTA have focused on crops, and the effect of DCPTA on crops exposed to soil drought are still unclear.</p>
<p>Nitrogen (N) metabolism is a fundamental process in determining the growth and productivity of plants (Kusano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011). After being taken up by root systems, nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) is converted to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) by nitrate reductase (NR), the first step of N uptake and utilization. Subsequently, nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) is converted to NH<sub>4</sub>+ by nitrite reductase (NiR) with reduction-ferredoxin (Fd<sub>red</sub>) as an electron donor (Rajasekhar <italic>etal.</italic>, 2010). Afterward, the ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), derived from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> reduction, photorespiration and/or other metabolic processes is assimilated into glutamine by the glutamine synthase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle or the alternative glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) pathway with 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and reducing equivalents provided by photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chardon <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, glutamate serving as a donor of the amino group is used for the synthesis of other amino acids, which are used for the synthesis of various organic molecules such as chlorophyll, proteins and nucleic acids. The reactions are catalysed by aminotransferases such as alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Slattery <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Drought disrupts N metabolism mainly via inhibiting the uptake and/or long-distance transportation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nacer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), altering the activities of enzymes involved in N metabolism (Robredo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011), inhibiting amino acid synthesis, and promoting protein hydrolysis (Fresneau <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007). At present, the study of plant growth regulators mainly concentrates on the improvement of photosynthesis and antioxidant systems, and there have been only a limited number of publications related to N metabolism.</p>
<p>Our previous hydroponic trial found that exogenous DCPTA drastically promoted growth under non-stress conditions and mitigated the PEG-simulated drought-induced growth inhibition of maize at the seedling stage (Xie <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). The present study was conducted to explore whether DCPTA can alleviate soil drought injuries to maize and whether the effects are associated with the modulation of nitrogen metabolism.</p>

<title>Plant material, growth conditions, design and sampling</title>
<p>Seeds of the maize cultivar ZhengDan 958 and DCPTA were obtained from the Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China and the China Zhengzhou Zhengshi Chemical Limited Company, respectively.</p>
<p>These experiments were performed in 2016 and 2017 at the Experimental Station of Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin (126&#x00B0;73&#x2019;E, 45&#x00B0;73&#x2019;N), Heilongjiang province, China. The research field area has a temperate continental monsoon climate. The rainfall and mean temperature data during the study period (2016 and 2017, May&#x2013;October) are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. Pits (inner length, 10 m; width, 7 m; and height, 1.2 m) in the field were used as experiment containers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Plastic sheets were used to cover the inner sides of the pits, and a rain-proof shed was used to ensure the crops were solely dependent on soil moisture and irrigation over the course of the experiment to maintain the soil water conditions. The soil used was Chernozem and was sieved (pore size, 1 cm) and diluted with vermiculite (particle diameter, 4-8 mm; soil to vermiculite, v/v, 2:1). Before planting, soil chemical analysis was conducted according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cottenie <italic>et al</italic>. (1982)</xref>, and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Fertilization was carried out by adding ammonium nitrate (33.5% N), calcium superphosphate (15.5% P2O5), and potassium sulfate (48% K2O) at the rates of 8.0, 8.0 and 20 kg pit<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively, before planting. No fertilizer was applied after planting. All containers were watered to 85% before planting. The seeds were manually sown on 2nd May 2016 and 4th May 2017 and were harvested on 7th October 2016 and 3rd October 2017, respectively. Three seeds were sowed per hole to ensure germination, and only the healthiest seedling within 20 days was kept at each site. Each container consisted of 10 rows, and the plant-to-plant and row-to-row distances were 20 cm and 65 cm, respectively. In addition, the ground around the containers was manually sown with the same plant-to-plant and row-to-row distances. The control of plant diseases and insect pests was conducted by managers. The maize at the nine-leaf stage (during the pre-female inflorescence emergence stage) were treated as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>plants were irrigated continuously and sprayed with either 10 mL water (well-watered) or DCPTA (well-watered+DCPTA) per plant;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>irrigation was stopped to form the drought conditions and sprayed with 10 mL of either water (drought) or DCPTA (drought +DCPTA) per plant; plants were rehydrated after 20 days of drought treatment.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<p>The concentrations of DCPTA (25 mg/L) were based on the results of previous screening experiments, and Tween-20 (0.03%) was added as a surfactant to the solution for spraying. Each treatment had five replicates, and experiments were performed in a completely randomized design. The dynamic changes in soil water contents during the experimental stage are exhibited in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.</xref></p>

<p>Random plants from each treatment were sampled on days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30. For leaf sampling, the middle part of the 9<sup>th</sup> leaf (numbered basipetally) was sampled for analysis of leaf gas exchange, and the same part of the leaf was stored at-80&#x00B0;C after immersion in liquid nitrogen for 30 min for determination of physiological parameters. For root sampling, a hand-held soil auger (inner diameter of 20 cm) was used to obtain soil cores from 0 to100 cm depth of the soil profile at 10 cm increments. The soil cores were soaked in a plastic container overnight, and roots were stirred and sieved through a mesh (400 holes cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>). The soil cores were the carefully washed by swirling water through the cores. The soil material and old dead roots debris were manually separated from the live roots.</p>

<title>Relative growth rate (RGR) and plant productivity</title>
<p>The shoots and roots of maize were oven dried at 105&#x00B0;C for 45 min and then held at 80&#x00B0;C for 48 h; the shoot and root dry weights plant<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> were determined soon afterwards. The RGR was determined as follows: RGR (fresh weight) = [ln (final dry weight) &#x2013; ln (initial dry weight)]/(duration of treatment days) (Kingsbury <italic>et al.,</italic> 1984). A leaf area metre (Li-COR 3100; Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to estimate the leaf area; number of grains plant<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (GN) and grain yield plant<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (GY) were recorded at the maize physiological maturity stage.</p>

<title>Leaf relative water content of (RLWC) and soil water content (SWC)</title>
<p>The RLWC was determined on fresh leaf disks (2&#x00D7;2 cm) from the middle part of the 8th leaves (numbered basipetally). After they were weighed (FW), the disks were immersed in distilled water at 25 &#x00B0;C overnight to obtain the turgid weight (TW). The leaves were dried at 80&#x00B0;C for 48 h and then weighed a third time (DW). RLWC was calculated as follows:</p>
<p>RLWC (%) = [(FW-DW)/ (TW - DW)] &#x00D7; 100.</p>
<p>SWC was determined in the soil from the internal area of each container. After being weighed (FW), the soil portion was dried at 85&#x00B0;C for 96 h and then weighed (DW). SWC was calculated as follows:</p>
<p>SWC (%) = [(FW-DW)/DW] &#x00D7;100.</p>

<title>Root morphological traits, root hydraulic conductivity, and the collection of root-bleeding sap</title>
<p>Roots from each soil core were scanned using a digital scanner (Epson V700, Indonesia).

<p>The plants were cut by scissors at 10&#x2013;12 cm above the soil surface at 18:00-19:00. Centrifuge tubes (inner diameter 40 mm) with cotton were placed on the upper end of the stalks, and the stalk joints and centrifuge tubes were wrapped by plastic film to keep impurities and insects out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).

However, the decrease in maize yield was partially recovered by DCPTA. Compared with the well-watered treatment, in the drought+DCPTA treatment, the grain number decreased by 14.01% in 2016 and by 16.55% in 2017, and the grain yield decreased by 17.98% in 2016 and by 20.54% in 2017. Moreover, the application of DCPTA improved maize yield under well-watered conditions.

<title>Chloroplast ultrastructure</title>
<p>Regardless of whether DCPTA was applied, the photosynthetic mesophyll cells of the non-stressed seedlings included a delimited cell wall containing chloroplasts. These chloroplasts had intact membranes and a regular arrangement of granal and stromal thylakoids, which were attached to the cell wall and exhibited typical ellipsoidal shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. 12</xref>). However, in the stressed seedlings, the cell wall structure was incomplete and exhibited indistinct gradation, a lower density, and loose edges. Plasmolysis and degradation were also evident in part of the cell membrane. Moreover, the chloroplasts, which separated from the plasma membrane, were nearly round and swelled asymmetrically, the thylakoids were overly disorganized, and the thylakoid membranes were loose and showed an increased number of plastoglobules. In the PEG-6000+DCPTA treatment, the complete membrane structures of the chloroplasts were present, and the shapes of the chloroplasts changed slightly from elongated ellipses to ellipses close to the cell walls. A well-aligned internal lamellar system and fewer plastoglobules were observed in the leaves of the PEG-6000+DCPTA treatment compared with the leaves of the PEG-6000 treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the most clear and consistent effects of drought on crops is the inhibition of growth and yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sinclair, 2011</xref>). In this experiment, exogenous DCPTA partly mitigated the reductions in plant growth and yield induced by drought, as expressed by the stable soot and root RGR, GN and GY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Moreover, exogenous DCPTA promoted growth and yield under well-watered conditions.</p>
<p>N is a necessary macro-nutrient element for plants and a main limiting factor in plant growth and development (Kusano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011). The pre-female inflorescence emergence stage is the important stage determining maize yield (Talaat <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015). The inhibition of maize growth induced by drought could be partly attributed to nitrogen metabolism during the pre-female inflorescence emergence stage. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> is the main nitrogen source assimilated by higher plants in agricultural soils (Robredo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011). Similar to previous reports for tomato (S&#x00E1;nchez-Rodr&#x00ED;guez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011) and wheat (Fresneau <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007), drought significantly diminished the NO<sub>3</sub>_ content in maize leaves in both the DCPTA-treated and non-treated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. 14</xref>). This decrease may be explained by drought-induced inhibitions in nitrate uptake from the roots and/or nitrate transport. However, the reduction in the non-treated leaves was greater than that in the DCPTA-treated leaves in this study.</p>
<p>Maintaining the supply of nutrients and water from the soil to crop depends on root morphology, which can be characterized by RLD and RSD (Kamran <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018). Previous studies have reported that DCPTA promotes root development in tomatoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keithly <italic>et al,</italic> 1990a</xref>). In this study, there was a significant difference between the RLD and RSD of the well-watered treatment and DCPTA treatment in 0-20 cm and 0-30 cm in 2016 and 2017 on day 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). This result suggests that DCPTA promoted root development in maize under well-watered conditions. Interestingly, under drought conditions, the DCPTA application significantly increased RLD, RSD and the root RGR. These results indicate that the DCPTA application also promoted maize root growth and improved the spatial and temporal distribution of roots, which was beneficial to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> uptake under drought conditions.</p>
<p>The xylem sap transports water and nutrients from the roots throughout the plant and depends on transpiration intensity and root pressure. The increased root hydraulic conductivity and flow rate of root-bleeding sap induced by the DCPTA application may, due to the enhanced root pressure, which depend on physiological activity of the whole root system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>) (Noguchi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005; Lui <italic>et al,</italic> 2014). In addition, the NO<sub>3</sub>_ delivery rate in the presence of DCPTA was significantly higher than that without DCPTA under drought conditions, which may partly result from the improved NO<sub>3</sub>_ absorption and enhanced root pressure induced by DCPTA. The stable RLWC in the drought+DCPTA treatment suggests an abundant supply water to the aboveground parts, and balanced transpirational loss and water uptake under drought conditions; as a result, the DCPTA-treated plants maintained Gs, which reduced the leaf epidermal resistance and promoted the mass flow of water to the leaf surface and the transportation of the NO3_ required for N metabolism in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>). Under drought conditions, increases in the foliar NO3_ were observed in the DCPTA-treated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. 14</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether stomatal or non-stomatal factors are the main cause of a reduced Pn may be determined by changes in Gs and Ci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bethke and Drew, 1992</xref>). During the early period of drought, the change of Ci were accompanied by continuously declined Gs, then Gs decreases but Ci shows an increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the decrease of the Pn in drought-treated plants was mainly attributed to stomatal limitations firstly, and then, non-stomatal limitations induced by the damage of photochemical mechanism, partly reflected by damaged chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. 12</xref>). However, DCPTA application maintains relatively high Gs, ensuring the availability of CO<sub>2</sub> for the carbon reduction cycle. Simultaneously, the DCPTA application delayed the increase in <italic>Ci</italic> and protected the chloroplast ultrastructure against drought-induced oxidative damage, which suggests that DCPTA can protect the photochemical mechanism and, as a result, ensures a more efficient photosynthesis process after rehydration. Moreover, similar to previous studies on spruce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keithly <italic>et al.,</italic> 1990a</xref>), sugar beets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Keithly <italic>et al,</italic> 1990b</xref>) and guayule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wan and Mendoza, 1992</xref>), DCPTA application also promoted photosynthesis under well-watered conditions.</p>
<p>In most plants, nitrate reduction occurs in leaves. NO3, after being taken up into the leaf cell, is converted to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> by two successive steps catalysed by NR and NiR. NR, the rate-limiting enzyme of nitrogen assimilation, is highly sensitive to stress (Plett <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016). Similar to previous studies on wheat and barley, the NR activity continuously declined in response to drought (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Fig. 15</xref>) (Robredo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011; Fresneau <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007). As a typical nitrate-induced enzyme, NR activity is primarily regulated by the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> concentration in the leaves (Chamizo-Ampudia <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). The up-regulation of foliar NR activity in the drought+DCPTA treatment may result from the increase in the foliar NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. 14</xref>). Moreover, the reduction in the foliar NiR activity under drought conditions was significantly reversed by the application of DCPTA, which may be because the DCPTA-stabilized photosynthesis resulted in a sufficient supply of Fdred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Fig. 15</xref>), thus promoting the conversion of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> to N&#x00BE;+. The present results indicate that DCPTA pretreatment could maintain a high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> assimilation ability in maize under drought conditions.</p>
<p>Although the foliar NR and NiR activities declined during the drought period, the foliar NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> content exhibited an increasing tendency in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Fig. 14</xref>). This increase may be associated with the glycine oxidation in activated photorespiration, which is induced by decreases in <italic>Ci</italic> levels under drought conditions (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012). The increased <italic>Gs</italic> induced by DCPTA was beneficial to the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> in the cellular spaces of the leaf, implying that photorespiration was partly alleviated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
<p>In plants cells, excessive levels of NH<sub>4</sub>+ are destructive, and the major NH<sub>4</sub>+ assimilation pathway is the GS/GOGAT cycle in higher plants. When the GS/GOGAT cycle is suppressed and the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> content rises continuously under stress, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> could serve as a substrate to form glutamate via the reversible amination of 2-OG by GDH catalyse, although the enzyme has a lower affinity for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (Fontaine <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012). In general, drought inhibited N&#x00BE;<sup>+</sup> assimilation (Naya <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007). During the early period of drought, GDH activity increased sharply, GS activity increased slightly, and GOGAT remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Fig. 16</xref>). These results suggest that accelerated NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation in maize may be an adaptive mechanism to produce more glutamate and eliminate the accumulation of excess foliar NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Subsequently, the GS and GOGAT activities decreased, which may have resulted from an inadequate supply of energy and 2-OG because of photosynthetic inhibition and decreased ICDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig. 13</xref>). GDH activity decreased with drought, which may be due to the oxidative degradation of GS caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by drought conditions (Xia <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015).</p>
<p>The DCPTA application altered the major N&#x00BE;<sup>+</sup> assimilation pathway, maintained the GOGAT/GS cycle and suppressed the GDH pathway, which may have contributed to maintaining the conversion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to glutamine and the subsequent formation of glutamate from glutamine. This result may occur because the photosynthetic stability and ICDH activity induced by the DCPTA application promoted 2-OG synthesis and the reducing power (i.e., NADPH, ATP, or Fd<sub>re</sub>d) in plants during the drought period, thus providing the GS/GOGAT cycle with relatively sufficient substrates and energy and favouring the enhancement of foliar GOGAT and GS activities (Du <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016). As a result, with the application of DCPTA, drought had less of an effect on the activities of GS and GOGAT.</p>
<p>Although DCPTA promoted NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> assimilation, as expressed by the increased NR and NiR activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Fig. 15</xref>), this treatment compared to the drought treatment caused significant decreases in the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> content, which means that exogenous DCPTA resulted in the integration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> into the structure of organic compounds, thereby contributing to the reduction in the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> content. Therefore, the DCPTA application effectively modulated the activities of ICDH, GS, GOGAT and GDH and accelerated the conversion of NH<sub>4</sub>+ to glutamate, which is the precursor of other amino acids.</p>
<p>Transamination is a key step in the biosynthesis of various amino acids from glutamate, with the availability of C skeletons from the Krebs cycle (Hodges, 2002). In our studies, both the aminotransferases studied, AlaAT and AspAT, showed increased activity in maize during the early drought period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Fig. 17</xref>). Such increases in aminotransferases activities under drought conditions might help in the synthesis of increased amounts of amino acids that act as compatible cytoplasmic solutes and protect cell organelles and biomolecules, thus reducing the adverse effects of drought on maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>). Subsequently, the AlaAT and AspAT activities decreased, which may be attributable to the weakened GS/NADH-GOGAT pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Fig. 16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gangwar and Singh, 2011</xref>). Moreover, stable aminotransferase activities were observed in DCPTA-treated plants. This finding may be associated with increased GS/GOGAT activities, which can generate more glutamate to serve as a substrate for transamination reactions in maize treated with DCPTA under drought conditions.</p>
<p>Most soluble proteins are enzymes that participate in various metabolic pathways in plants; therefore, the soluble protein content is considered one of the most important indices reflecting the overall metabolic level in plants. Protein synthesis in plants is very sensitive to abiotic stresses and is positively correlated with stress tolerance (Fresneau <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007). Free amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Drought increased the free amino acid contents, which may mainly be attributed to the increased AlaAT and AspAT activities in the early drought period and the subsequent promotion of protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Fig. 18</xref>) (Yang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013). However, DCPTA-treated seedlings maintained higher soluble protein levels and lower free amino acid levels than did non-DCPTA-treated seedlings in response to drought. This result may occur because DCPTA inhibited protein degradation by stable protease activities and maintained protein stability, ensuring the series of physiological and biochemical processes that occur normally under stress conditions. Additionally, the DCPTA application increased the amino acid contents under well-watered conditions, which may be attributable to the promoted biosynthesis and accumulation of amino acids, which ultimately improved plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Talaat and Shawky, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study suggested that DCPTA treatment increased NO3_ uptake and the long-distance transportation of NO3<sup>_</sup> from the roots to the leaves via the production of excess roots and maintained a stabilized transpiration rate. The increased foliar NO3<sup>_</sup> content up-regulated NR activity and maintained a high N assimilation ability that was restrained by drought. Exogenous DCPTA effectively regulated the ICDH, GS, GOGAT and GDH activities to speed up the conversion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to Glu, reduced the toxicity of excess NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to the plant, and accelerated the synthesis of proteins and amino acids. Moreover, DCPTA treatment maintained increased the photosynthetic capacity, supply nitrogen metabolism of energy and carbon skeleton thus alleviating the inhibition of growth by drought in maize.</p></sec>
