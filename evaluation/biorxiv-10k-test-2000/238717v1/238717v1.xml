<title>Summary</title>
<p>Hepatocyte replication maintains liver homeostasis and integrity. It is impaired in chronic liver disease, promoting disease progression. Herein, we have identified NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK) as an unrecognized suppressor of hepatocyte replication. Hepatic NIK was aberrantly activated in chronic liver disease. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>NIK</italic> or its downstream mediator <italic>IKK&#x03B1;</italic> substantially accelerated hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Mechanistically, NIK and IKK&#x03B1; suppressed the mitogenic JAK2/STAT3 pathway, thereby inhibiting hepatocyte cell cycle progression. Remarkably, inactivation of hepatic NIK largely reversed suppression of the hepatic JAK2/STAT3 pathway, hepatocyte replication, and liver regeneration induced by either chronic liver injury or metabolic stress. Our data suggest that hepatic NIK acts as a rheostat for liver regeneration to restrain liver overgrowth. Pathologic activation of hepatic NIK blocks hepatocyte replication, likely contributing to liver disease progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The liver is an essential metabolic organ, and often experiences metabolic stress during fasting and feeding and in overnutrition states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Rui, 2014</xref>). It is also frequently exposed to harmful insults, because it detoxifies endogenous and exogenous hepatotoxic substances. Dietary hepatotoxins and gut microbiota-derived toxic substances are transported directly to the liver through enterohepatic circulation, further increasing risk for liver injury. To compensate for a loss of hepatocytes, the liver has a powerful regenerative capability to maintain its homeostasis and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Michalopoulos, 2017</xref>). After 70&#x0025; of partial hepatectomy (PHx), rodents are able to regain their normal liver mass within one week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Miyaoka et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, it is equally important to avoid generation of aberrant liver cells from damaged hepatocytes in order to maintain liver integrity. Thus, a quality control mechanism likely exists to block injured hepatocytes from proliferating. We speculate that hepatocellular stress and/or injury signals activate hepatocyte-intrinsic sensors that in turn block proliferation of damaged hepatocytes through this putative quality control system.</p>
<p>Reparative hepatocyte proliferation is severely impaired in chronic liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, and a chronic exposure to hepatotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Inaba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Michalopoulos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Richardson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Sancho-Bru et al., 2012</xref>). Hepatocyte proliferative arrest is associated with liver inflammation, injury, and fibrosis in patients with steatohepatitis (NASH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Richardson et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that impaired hepatocyte replication exacerbates disease progression. Numerous factors have been identified to promote hepatocyte proliferation, including various cytokines, growth factors, and the JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, PI 3-kinase, and NF-kB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Michalopoulos, 2017</xref>). Paradoxically, most of these positive regulators are elevated in chronic liver disease. We reason that liver regeneration is also governed by negative regulators that function as a molecular rheostat to restrain liver overgrowth by counterbalancing positive regulators. Some of these negative regulators likely have dual functions and are involved in the quality control of liver regeneration by blocking proliferation of damaged hepatocytes. We postulate that in chronic liver disease, such negative regulators are overactivated by hepatocellular stress/injury, leading to pathological suppression of hepatocyte proliferation/liver regeneration. However, negative regulators for hepatocyte replication, in contrast to extensively studied positive regulators, are poorly understood.</p>
<p>In search for such negative regulators that couple hepatic injury to hepatocyte replication, we identified NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK is a Ser/Thr kinase known to activate the noncanonical NF-kB2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Sun, 2012</xref>). It phosphorylates and activates IKK&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>). IKK&#x03B1; phosphorylates NF-kB2 precursor p100, resulting in generation of a mature NF-kB2 p52 form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Sun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>). We reported that metabolic stress, oxidative stress, hepatotoxins, and many cytokines all stimulate hepatic NIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, hepatic NIK is aberrantly activated in both mice and humans with NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, or other types of chronic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, NIK is involved in sensing of hepatocellular stress and damage, likely functioning as a hepatocyte-intrinsic sensor for stress/injury. In this work, we characterized hepatocyte-specific <italic>NIK</italic> (<italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic>) and <italic>IKK&#x03B1;</italic> (<italic>IKK&#x03B1;<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic>) knockout mice, and examined reparative hepatocyte replication using a PHx model. We found that the hepatic NIK/IKK&#x03B1; pathway suppresses reparative hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Aberrantly activated hepatic NIK in chronic liver disease is responsible for, in part, impairment in liver regeneration. Our data suggest that NIK is an unrecognized hepatocyte-intrinsic sensor for stress/injury and negative regulator of hepatocyte proliferation.</p>

<title>Hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>NIK</italic> accelerates liver regeneration in mice</title>
<p>To assess the role of hepatic NIK in hepatocyte reparative proliferation, we performed 70&#x0025; of PHx on hepatocyte-specific <italic>NIK</italic> knockout mice at age of 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Mitchell and Willenbring, 2008</xref>). <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice were generated by crossing <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice with <italic>albumin-Cre</italic> drivers as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Proliferating cells were detected by immunostaining liver sections with antibody against Ki67, a marker of proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Liver proliferating rates were low (&#x003C;1&#x0025;) under basal conditions and comparable between <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> and <italic>NIK<sup>flox//flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). PHx markedly increased the number of Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> proliferating cells in both groups 48 h after PHx; remarkably, liver proliferating cells were 85&#x0025; higher in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice relative to <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In line with these findings, the number of liver BrdU&#x002B; proliferating cell, as assessed by BrdU assays, was also much higher in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> than in <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Liver cell proliferation declined 48 h after PHx in both <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> and <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice, and became comparable between these two groups within 96 h after PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm that the proliferating cells are hepatocytes, we costained liver sections with antibodies against either Ki67 and HNF4&#x03B1; (a hepatocyte marker) or Ki67 and F4/80 (a Kupffer cell/macrophage marker). HNF4&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> hepatocytes accounted for 96&#x0025; of liver Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> proliferating cells in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice 48 h after PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1F</xref>), whereas F4/80<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Kupffer cells/macrophages accounted for &#x003C;4&#x0025; of Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that NIK is an intrinsic suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the effect of NIK deficiency on hepatocyte death. The number of liver TUNEL<sup>&#x002B;</sup> apoptotic cells, as assessed by TUNEL assays, was slightly lower in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> than in <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice, but the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, a liver injury index, was comparable between <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> and <italic>NIK<sup>flox//flox</sup></italic> mice under both basal and PHx conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that hepatic NIK regulates hepatocyte death under these conditions.</p>
<p>To further validate the role of hepatic NIK in the maintenance of liver homeostasis, we quantified liver regeneration rates within 48 h after PHx. In line with increased hepatocyte proliferation, liver growth rates were also significantly increased in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice compared with <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1I</xref>). In light of these findings, we propose that NIK is a hepatocyte-intrinsic rheostat for reparative proliferation that is involved in the maintenance of liver homeostasis and integrity. Moreover, damage-induced NIK activation likely provides a quality control mechanism to prevent generation of aberrant cells from damaged hepatocytes.</p>

<p>To further confirm NIK inhibition of hepatic cell cycle progression, we measured the levels of hepatic cyclin D1, which is believed to drive hepatocyte proliferation after PHx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Michalopoulos, 2013</xref>).

<p>We next sought to study the molecular mechanism of NIK action. NF-kB1, MAPK, and PI 3-kinase pathways are known to be involved in mediating PHx-stimulated liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Michalopoulos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Pauta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Wuestefeld et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, phosphorylation of hepatic IKK&#x03B1;/&#x03B2;, IkB&#x03B1;, p65 (the NF-kB1 pathway), Akt (pSer473) (the PI 3-kinase pathway), ERK1/2, and JNK (the MAPK pathway) was comparable between <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> and <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice 4 h after PHx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We also assessed liver reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of various cytokines, and did not detect difference between <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> and <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Therefore, these pathways are unlikely to mediate suppression of liver regeneration by hepatic NIK.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>NIK directly suppresses the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 pathway</title>
<p>JAK2 phosphorylates and activates STAT3, and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway is believed to drive hepatocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). We postulated that NIK might suppresses hepatocyte proliferation by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Liver extracts were prepared 4 h after PHx and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-JAK2 (pTyr1007/1008) or anti-phospho-STAT3 (pTyr705) antibodies. Phosphorylation of both JAK2 and STAT3 was significantly higher in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> than in <italic>NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="238717_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To confirm that NIK directly inhibits the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, we transiently coexpressed JAK2 and STAT3 with NIK in HEK293 cells. JAK2 was autophosphorylated and robustly phosphorylated STAT3 in the absence of NIK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Rui and Carter-Su, 1999</xref>). Overexpression of NIK dramatically attenuated phosphorylation of both JAK2 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, NIK was coimmunoprecipitated with JAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These data indicate that NIK binds to JAK2 and inhibits JAK2 activity, thereby suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.</p>
<p>We next tested if NIK negatively regulates interleukin 6 (IL6)-stimulated activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, because the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 cascade is required for hepatocyte reparative proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cressman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Riehle et al., 2008</xref>). Mouse primary hepatocytes were transduced with NIK or &#x03B2;-galactosidase (&#x03B2;-gal; control) adenoviral vectors, and then stimulated with IL6. IL6 rapidly and robustly stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3 in &#x03B2;-gal-transduced hepatocytes; strikingly, overexpression of NIK completely blocked IL6-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We did not detect endogenous JAK2, because its levels were below the detection threshold of our assays. Overall, our data unveiled unrecognized crosstalk between NIK and JAK2/STAT3 pathways. NIK inhibits hepatocyte proliferation at least in part by restraining the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Reparative hepatocyte proliferation supplies new hepatocytes to replace lost and damaged hepatocytes, thereby maintaining liver homeostasis and integrity. The quality control mechanism of liver regeneration likely blocks proliferation of damaged hepatocytes, preventing generation of dysfunctional or aberrant cells from the impaired hepatocytes. In this work, we have identified NIK as a hepatocyte-intrinsic sensor for liver stress and injury that controls the quality control machinery. Supporting this notion, we found that metabolic stress and numerous hepatotoxic stimuli potently activate hepatic NIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>). Hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>NIK</italic>, which is expected allow damaged hepatocytes to regain their proliferating capability due to disruption of their quality control mechanism, substantially increases hepatocyte proliferation and accelerates liver regeneration in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice following PHx.</p>
<p>We have gained important insight into the potential molecular mechanism by which NIK suppresses hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. NIK is known to activate IKK&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Sun, 2012</xref>). We found that mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of <italic>IKK&#x03B1;</italic> phenocopy <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice with regard to reparative hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration following PHx. It is well established that activation of the JAK2/STAT3 drives hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Cressman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Riehle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, we observed that IKK&#x03B1; binds to JAK2 and inhibits the ability of JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT3 in cell cultures. In line with these findings, phosphorylation of endogenous hepatic JAK2 and STAT3 is markedly elevated in both <italic>IKK&#x03B1;<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> and <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice following PHx. These results unveil novel crosstalk between the NIK/IKK&#x03B1; pathway and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In light of these findings, we propose that the NIK/IKK&#x03B1; cascade, which is activated in damaged hepatocytes, functions as a brake to block proliferation of damaged hepatocytes through, in part, inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Notably, we found that NIK also directly binds to JAK2 and inhibits JAK2 activity (i.e. its autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate STAT3) in cell cultures. Therefore, NIK is able to suppress the JAK2/STAT3 pathway both directly and indirectly via IKK&#x03B1;. Additional studies are warranted to determine the relative contributions of the IKK&#x03B1;-dependent and the IKK&#x03B1;-independent mechanisms to suppression of liver regeneration by NIK.</p>
<p>We have provided proof of concept evidence showing that abnormally-activated hepatic NIK is responsible for suppression of liver regeneration in chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease was modeled using two distinct approaches: chronic treatment with either hepatotoxin AAF or a HFD. In these contexts, we postulate that hepatic NIK serves as a rheostat for liver regeneration to counterbalance overgrowth of the liver. Thus, aberrant activation of hepatic NIK is expected to impair reparative hepatocyte proliferation, contributing to liver disease progression. Supporting this notion, we found that hepatocyte-specific inactivation of NIK substantially increases hepatocyte proliferation in both AAF-treated or HFD-fed <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice following PHx. Consistently, both phosphorylation of hepatic JAK2 and STAT3 and expression of hepatic cyclin D1 are markedly elevated in <italic>NIK<sup>&#x0394;hep</sup></italic> mice. These findings raise an intriguing possibility that pharmacological inhibition of hepatic NIK may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to treat chronic liver disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have identified hepatic NIK as an unrecognized hepatocyte-intrinsic sensor for hepatic stress/injury that suppresses liver regeneration through, in part, inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In chronic liver disease, aberrantly-activated hepatic NIK impairs liver regeneration, contributing to liver disease progression.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ROS assays</title>
<p>Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagents (Life technologies). Relative mRNA abundance of different genes was measured using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies, 4367659). Liver lysates were mixed with a dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescent (DCF, Sigma, D6883) probe (5 &#x03BC;M) for 1 h at 37&#x00B0;C. DCF fluorescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (485 nm excitation and 527 nm emission).</p>
