<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> species are globally disseminated pathogens and the predominant cause of gastroenteritis. The pathogenesis of salmonellosis has been extensively studied using <italic>in vivo</italic> murine models and cell lines typically challenged with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium. Although serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium are responsible for the most of human infections reported to the CDC, several other serovars also contribute to clinical cases of salmonellosis. Despite their epidemiological importance, little is known about their infection phenotypes. Here, we report the virulence characteristics and genomes of 10 atypical <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars linked to multistate foodborne outbreaks in the United States. We show that the murine RAW 264.7 macrophage model of infection is unsuitable for inferring human relevant differences in nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections whereas differentiated human THP-1 macrophages allowed these isolates to be further characterised in a more relevant, human context.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> is a zoonotic pathogen responsible for illnesses on a global scale and poses a significant burden to public health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Invasive salmonellae, such as the host-restricted <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<italic>S. enterica</italic>) serovars Typhi and Paratyphi cause fever in humans killing nearly 217,000 people worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Infection with nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> (NTS) such as <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium results in bacteraemia and gastroenteritis and is estimated to cause 155,000 deaths annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> are non-fastidious bacteria that can survive outside the host in a range of food matrices, low-moisture conditions as well as food processing environments. In humans, infection commonly occurs following the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Sources for contamination vary and can range from the presence of the bacterium on raw produce to the shedding of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the faecal and urinary excretions of reservoir animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Upon entering the host, salmonellae are challenged by a series of adverse conditions including the low pH environment of the stomach, the membrane disrupting properties of bile in the small intestine and a battery of phagocytic host immune cells such as macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Deployment of a <underline>T</underline>ype <underline>III</underline> Secretion <underline>S</underline>ystem (T3SS) apparatus is fundamental to the pathogenesis of <italic>Salmonella</italic> and enables the bacterium to translocate effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The acquisition of <underline>S</underline>almonella <underline>P</underline>athogenicity <underline>i</underline>sland (SPI) encoded virulence factors <italic>via</italic> horizontal gene transfer followed by evolution has enabled this microorganism to exploit a privileged replicative niche, avoiding the host innate immune system within intracellular vesicles called <italic><underline>S</underline>almonella</italic>-<underline>C</underline>ontaining <underline>V</underline>acuole (SCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The protection afforded by the SCV allows <italic>Salmonella</italic> to thrive and sets in motion a cycle of infection whereby the bacterium can proliferate and basolaterally reinfect epithelial cells as well as become engulfed by additional, localised phagocytic cells.</p>
<p>The importance of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in both clinical and public health settings has fuelled research into the virulence mechanisms and associated pathogenicity of this bacterium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Many of these studies use <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> infection in mice as a model for typhoid fever due to the similar pathology observed including intestinal and extraintestinal lesions that frequently occur in human hosts infected with typhoidal serovars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptome of S. Typhimurium has been characterised extensively by sequencing-based methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, the <italic>ex vivo</italic> response of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium during infection of macrophages has also been elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infection of mice results in symptoms mimicking human typhoid fever, this serovar, along with S. Enteritidis is predominantly associated with gastroenteritis in humans. Despite the fact that over 2,610 serovars of <italic>Salmonella</italic> have been reported to date, few studies are available to describe the infection arising from other <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, 10 atypical <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars cultured from multistate foodborne outbreaks in the U.S. were characterised both pheno&#x002D; and genotypically. Differences in the nature of the infection process and the underlying virulence determinants were noted. We identified factors that further explain the ability of these atypical <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars to cause foodborne outbreaks.</p>

<p>The acid tolerance response of <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a complex defence mechanism employed by the pathogen to defend against the acid shock experienced in the stomach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Increased numbers for the majority of isolates were recorded following 1 and 2 hours of growth at pH 2.5 before significant reductions in viable numbers occurred at 4 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1). Motility has been suggested as a virulence determinant with respect to invasion with notable non-motile and/or host adapted exceptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. After 24 hours of incubation at 21 &#x00B0;C, <italic>S</italic>. Bareilly CFSAN001111 and <italic>S</italic>. Javiana CFSAN000905 exhibited a reduced swim phenotype when compared to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST4/74 (P &#x003C; 0.001) whereas S. Newport CFSAN003345 and <italic>S</italic>. Saintpaul CFSAN004090 exhibited an increased swim phenotype (P &#x003C; 0.001). At 37 &#x00B0;C, <italic>S</italic>. Anatum CFSAN003959 and <italic>S</italic>. Tennessee CFSAN001387 exhibited a reduced swim phenotype after 8 and 24 hours when compared to S. Typhimurium ST4/74 (P &#x003C; 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the absence of glucose as a carbon source, no swarm motility was observed for any of the isolates regardless of temperature or incubation time (Supplementary 5 Fig. S2). During digestion, contraction of the gall bladder releases bile into the small intestine. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Weltevreden CFSAN001415 showed a two-fold difference in susceptibility to sodium deoxycholate (DOC) in comparison to S. Typhimurium ST4/74 although the MBC was comparable to the other isolates (Supplementary Table S1).</p>

<title>Intracellular survival of atypical <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars in murine and human macrophages</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium pathogenesis has been extensively studied <italic>in vivo</italic> using murine models and <italic>ex vivo</italic> using murine cell lines (such as J774.2 and RAW 264.7). However, the differences in the ability of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to survive and replicate within human macrophages is currently not well described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Differentiated human monocyte cell lines (including THP-1 and U937) have been used to explore the replication of <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium. Few studies describing the bacterial replication in human macrophages of atypical NTS serovars have been reported despite their epidemiological importance and their contributions to clinical cases of salmonellosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To study the ability of the isolates to survive phagocytosis, infections were performed using murine RAW 264.7 and differentiated human THP-1 macrophages by the gentamicin protection assay adapted from protocols previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium 14028S and ST4/74 were included as reference strains in all infection assays. Infections were carried out at a <underline>M</underline>ultiplicity <underline>O</underline>f <underline>I</underline>nfection (MOI) of 10:1. Viable internalised bacteria were enumerated at 2, 4, 8 and 24 <underline>H</underline>ours <underline>P</underline>ost <underline>I</underline>nfection (HPI) in RAW 264.7 and 2, 4, 8, 24 and 168 HPI in THP-1 macrophages.</p>
<p>Of the 10 atypical serovars tested in this study, all isolates were found to persist within RAW 264.7 macrophages for 24 HPI with many of these increasing in number over the course of the infection. In the case of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden CFSAN001415, a 1-Log<sub>10</sub> decrease in intracellular bacteria between 2 and 24 HPI was recorded though this isolate was still recoverable. In contrast, <italic>S</italic>. Tennessee CFSAN001387 exhibited a 1-Log<sub>10</sub> increase in intracellular bacteria between 2 and 24 HPI. Similar numbers of viable bacteria were recorded for <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium 14028S and ST4/74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

<p>The highest and lowest mean <underline>C</underline>olony <underline>F</underline>orming <underline>U</underline>nits (CFU)/mL for all 10 atypical serovars are shown (Supplementary Table S2). When the Log2 fold change was calculated, <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden CFSAN001415 recorded the largest decrease at 8 and 24 HPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Of note, <italic>S</italic>. Bareilly CFSAN001111 showed an unusual infection profile in that it had the highest mean CFU/mL at 2 HPI, possibly indicative of increased invasiveness, despite normalisation of the infections by centrifuging the cell culture plates. The latter observation was maintained for all subsequent time points. However, the mean CFU/mL at 4, 8 and 24 HPI for <italic>S</italic>. Bareilly CFSAN001111 were lower than other isolates.</p>
<p>When compared to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST4/74, significant differences were observed in the infection profile of specific isolates at individual time points (Supplementary Table S3). Time courses longer than 24 hours were not possible in RAW 264.7 as this resulted in cell death or proliferation of the macrophages themselves which would skew the MOI. Although differences between these isolates were observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages, the inability to consistently extend the time course of the assay beyond 24 HPI limited the utility of this <italic>ex vivo</italic> murinemodel to discern any further differences in the ability of the isolates to survive and persist following phagocytosis. To mitigate this limitation and differentiate the isolates in a human relevant context, additional assays were carried out in differentiated THP-1 macrophages.</p>
<p>Of the 10 atypical serovars tested in this study, all persisted within THP-1 macrophages for 24 HPI with the majority exhibiting no significant changes in viable numbers up to this time point. As with RAW 264.7 macrophages, the only exception noted when infecting THP-1 macrophages was recorded for S. Weltevreden CFSAN001415 which exhibited a 1-Log<sub>10</sub> decrease in mean CFU/mL between 2 and 24 HPI but remained recoverable. Upon extending this assay beyond 24 hours to 168 HPI, equivalent to 7 days, all serovars with the exception of S. Anatum CFSAN003959 and both S. Typhimurium 14028S and ST4/74 reference strains were recoverable with the majority exhibiting a 2-Log<sub>10</sub> decrease in intracellular bacteria. Exceptions to this were noted for S. Cubana CFSAN002050, S. Heidelberg CFSAN002063 and S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 which showed a 1-Log<sub>10</sub> decrease in intracellular bacteria between 2 and 168 HPI with S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 displaying the smallest decrease of all isolates. Conversely, S. Weltevreden CFSAN001415 demonstrated the largest decrease in bacterial cell numbers at 168 HPI but unlike S. Anatum CFSAN003959 and both S. Typhimurium 14028S and ST4/74 reference strains, it could still be recovered at the end of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>The highest and lowest mean CFU/mL among the 10 study isolates are shown (Supplementary Table S2). In THP-1 macrophages, S. Weltevreden CFSAN001415 had the lowest mean CFU/mL at 24 and 168 HPI of the recoverable isolates as observed in the Log<sub>2</sub> fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages, S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 had the highest mean CFU/mL at 24 HPI as well as 168 HPI in THP-1 macrophages. When compared to S. Typhimurium ST4/74, significant differences were observed in the infection profiles of specific isolates at individual time points (Supplementary Table S2).</p>
<p>Fewer significant differences were observed between isolates when compared to S. Typhimurium ST4/74 infection in human THP-1 macrophages versus murine RAW 264.7 macrophages highlighting the potential unsuitability of the murine model for inferring human relevant differences between isolates in NTS infection. Overall, the viable intracellular bacteria recorded at later time points, including 24 HPI, was significantly higher in RAW 264.7 than THP-1. Bacterial cell numbers reached as high as 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> mean CFU/mL in RAW 264.7 for some atypical serovars compared with values that did not exceed 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> mean CFU/mL in THP-1 for all isolates. This 2-Log<sub>10</sub> difference supports our observations showing the inability of RAW 264.7 to clear infecting bacteria compared with THP-1 macrophages.</p>
<p>The viability of both murine and human macrophages following infection with each of the selected bacterial isolates was measured using colorimetric assays to measure extracellular <underline>G</underline>lucose <underline>6</underline>-<underline>P</underline>hosphate (G6P) and <underline>L</underline>actate <underline>D</underline>eHydrogenase (LDH) activities compared with uninfected control macrophages. No significant differences were observed in host cell viability following a MOI of 10:1 (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Fig. S5). This is in agreement with recent studies that used flow cytometry based techniques to quantify apoptosis in macrophages infected with different <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 was noted to be the most proliferative isolate in THP-1 macrophages, exhibiting the lowest reduction in viable intracellular bacteria between 2 and 168 HPI, further assays were performed to directly compare to S. Typhimurium ST4/74 with CFU being enumerated at 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 HPI. This was done to determine when S. Typhimurium ST4/74 was no longer recoverable compared with S. Tennessee CFSAN001387. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium ST4/74 exhibited an overall 1-Log10 reduction between 2 and 48 HPI with an additional 2-Log<sub>10</sub> reduction in viable bacteria by 72 hours. After 96 and 120 HPI, S. Typhimurium ST4/74 was barely detected and was unrecoverable at 144 and 168 HPI. In comparison, S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 exhibited an overall 1-Log10 reduction between 2 and 168 HPI, similar to the previous infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Differences between these two isolates were significant at multiple individual time points (Supplementary Table S4).</p>

<title>Host response to atypical S. <italic>enterica</italic> infection by murine and human macrophages</title>
<p>As there were notable differences exhibited by these <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars in their ability to replicate and survive within murine and human macrophages, the host response to infection was investigated by quantifying proinflammatory cytokine and infection relevant chemokine release using standard immunoassay protocols.</p>
<p>In RAW 264.7, increased CCL2 and CCL3 chemokine release was observed at 4, 8 and 24 HPI with S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 and S. Weltevreden CFSAN001415 when compared to uninfected control macrophages. When comparing infection with these 10 atypical serovars (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) to S. Typhimurium ST4/74, increased proinflammatory cytokine (including IL6, IL10 and TNF) and chemokine (including CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL10) release was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) (Supplementary Table S5).</p>

<p>In THP-1, increased proinflammatory cytokine (including CXCL8, IL1B, IL6 and TNF), cytokine (including CSF2, IL1A, IL12B and VEGFA) and chemokine (including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL10) release was recorded at 8, 24 and 168 HPI across a selection of these isolates in comparison with uninfected control macrophages. As with RAW 264.7, when comparing infection with the 10 atypical serovars in this study to S.

<p>SPI-1 and its associated T3SS have been extensively implicated in <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence and the ability of this pathogen to invade host eukaryotic cells, trigger inflammation and transport effector proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Sequence variation at the amino acid level in comparison to S. Typhimurium ST4/74 was greatest in AvrA, OrgB, SptP, SipD, InvB and SL2883 proteins. Several SPI-1 encoded genes were absent in many of the atypical serovars but present in S. Typhimurium ST4/74 though not yet fully characterised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The AvrA protein has been previously shown to be crucial, playing a role in the inhibition of the antiapoptotic NF-KB pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In S. Typhimurium 14028S, S. Anatum CFSAN003959, S. Javiana CFSAN000905 and S. Newport CFSAN003345, AvrA showed differences at the amino acid sequence level which may affect its ability to function as a protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. SptP is a tyrosine phosphatase involved in the inhibition Raf activation and the subsequent MAP kinase pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Its identification here is consistent with the phenotype observed for S. Heidelberg CFSAN002063 that stimulated high levels of TNF release at 4, 8, 24 and 168 HPI in THP-1 macrophages. A number of proteins, including STM2901, STM2902, STM2903, SL2883, STM2904 and STM2905 that are SPI-1 associated in S. Typhimurium ST4/74 showed mixed
conservation, either being highly similar in the majority of isolates or were unidentifiable in S. Anatum CFSAN003959, S. Javiana CFSAN000905 and S. Newport CFSAN003345.</p>
<p>SPI-2 and its associated T3SS contributes to the ability of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to translocate effectors across the membrane of the SCV when the bacterium is internalised in epithelial cells and macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The integral function of SPI-2 for intracellular survival can be observed by the degree of amino acid sequence conservation across all atypical serovars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). As these isolates were implicated in multistate foodborne outbreaks and, as demonstrated above, capable of surviving within both RAW 264.7 and THP-1 macrophages, this observation is consistent with the expressed phenotype and raises the question as to whether or not potential differences in the expression of some/all of these genes may further explain the differences shown in intracellular survival. Sequence variation at the amino acid level in comparison to S. Typhimurium ST4/74 was greatest in SsaB, SseB, SseC and SseD. Loss of the effector protein SsaB (SpiC) has been shown to promote defective virulence phenotypes due to an inability to translocate all SPI-2 effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This may explain the observed infection phenotype in S. Anatum CFSAN003959, the only isolate among the 10 atypical serovars studied to be unrecoverable at 168 HPI in THP-1 macrophages, as it had the lowest amino acid sequence similarity for SsaB.</p>
<p>SseBCD proteins function as a translocon that facilitate the secretion of effector proteins by intracellular <italic>Salmonella</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies aimed at elucidating the host response to NTS serovars including Enteritidis and Typhimurium have been facilitated by the availability of murine infection models. This study focussed on atypical serovars of this genus availing of isolates cultured from foodborne outbreaks, the majority of which are frequently listed in the top 20 serovars responsible for laboratory-confirmed human cases of salmonellosis as reported annually by the CDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. These data identify key differences between isolates related to their ability to survive within macrophages and highlight the potential unsuitability of the widely used murine macrophage model to infer human relevant distinctions between isolates. We have shown that for NTS serovars, distinct differences in the inflammatory response of human macrophages can further differentiate these microorganisms in a manner that was not possible with murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, the reference strains S. Typhimurium 14028S and ST4/74 that are often included in <italic>in vitro</italic> research emerged as the biological outliers in many respects with regards to their infection phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). In the case of specific proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, RAW 264.7 macrophages responded to infection with S. Typhimurium 14028S and ST4/74, S. Tennessee CFSAN001387 and S. Weltevreden CFSAN001415 whereas THP-1 macrophages displayed a broader proinflammatory response to the range of serovars studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>These data suggest more differences than previously acknowledged for S. <italic>enterica</italic> serovars with implications for public health. In agreement with this notion, key differences were identified in established virulence determinants of <italic>Salmonella</italic> such as SPI gene content bridging the gap 16between the observed phenotypes and the underlying genotypes. Further work will be required to understand the full scope of other potential targets within the genomes of these isolates such as the accessory gene content unique to individual strains, many of which are currently poorly characterised.</p>

Contigs were excluded from the assembly if they were shorter than 200 bp.</p>
<p>Analysis of the PacBio data was implemented using SMRT Analysis 2.3.0. The best <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was established with PacBio Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP 3.0) program using the continuous-long-reads from the three SMRT cells. The assembly outputs from HGAP produced circular contiguous sequences with overlapping regions at the end that can be identified using dot plots in Gepard (version 1.40)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Genomes were checked manually for even sequencing coverage. Afterwards the interim consensus sequence was used to determine the final consensus and accuracy scores using Quiver consensus algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>All sequences and assemblies are publicly available with accession numbers provided (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and are submitted for annotation using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
