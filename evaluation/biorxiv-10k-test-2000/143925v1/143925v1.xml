<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Methods for reliably estimating the quality of 3D models of proteins are essential drivers for the wide adoption and serious acceptance of protein structure predictions by life scientists. In this paper, the most successful groups in CASP12 describe their latest methods for Estimates of Model Accuracy (EMA). We show that pure single model accuracy estimation methods have shown clear progress since CASP11; the three top methods (MESHI, ProQ3, SVMQA) all perform better than the top method of CASP11 (ProQ2). The pure single model accuracy estimation methods outperform quasi-single (ModFOLD6 variations) and consensus methods (Pcons,ModFOLDclust2, Pcomb-domain and Wallner) in model selection, but are still not as good as those methods in absolute model quality estimation and predictions of local quality. Finally, we show that the correlation of the best consensus, combined and quasi-single methods with model quality measures is higher than between different model quality measures when it comes to global correlation. However, for local accuracy estimation there still room for improvement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Estimates of Model Accuracy (EMA) have been a part of protein structure prediction since its infancy. It is actually built into virtually all methods as the energy functions that they optimize. Yet, these energy functions provide only relative accuracy estimate, with moderate power in properly ranking models. Further, when one tries to use models from different methods, their associated energies are not comparable. Thus, accurate posterior quality estimation methods are essential for protein structure prediction to fulfill its potential.</p>
<p>Motivated by the intriguing experiment of Novotny et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, early model accuracy assessment method focused on distinguishing wrong models (or decoys) from the native structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. These knowledge based energy functions were also developed to guide protein folding and fragment assembly simulations and for threading studies. Notably, the methods by Sippl, which used a knowledge based energy function for threading, were quite successful in CASPl-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, in later CASP experiments threading methods have not been able to keep up with methods that use evolutionary information from the rapidly growing sequence databases.</p>
<p>None of the energy functions that were developed to distinguish native and non-native protein models showed any major success in CASP. Instead, more successful methods, starting with ProQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, that aim to predict the exact quality of a model have been more successful. One of the notable features separating these methods from the earlier knowledge based energy terms were the use of compatibility with predicted structural features, such as secondary structure. These methods are nowadays referred to as single model quality assessment methods to distinguish them from methods that use clustering (or consensus) of many models. In earlier CASPs the single methods have not been as successful as the methods that take into account structural similarity of models, i.e. consensus based methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, but since CASP11 they perform at least on par with the consensus methods in some of the tasks.</p>
<p>The first successful attempt of model accuracy estimation, in the context of CASP, was when the first meta predictor was introduced in CASP4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, in CASP4 the model estimates were done manually. It was realized that a simple rule combining the prediction from several servers could outperform all individual servers. This algorithm chose the most frequent fold predicted by all servers, i.e. choosing the consensus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Soon after CASP4, the first automatic consensus method, Pcons, was introduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This was soon followed by a simpler (and more robust) method, 3D-Jury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Later versions of Pcons are similar to 3D-Jury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In CASP5 it was clear that these methods could be used to outshine all individual servers if the results were combined. In CASP7 model accuracy estimation became a category by itself for the first time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Quasi-single model methods, such as the latest ModFOLD servers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> compare a model with models generated by a local prediction-pipeline using the consensus approach. These methods, as well as Pcomb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> that uses the Pcons consensus approach, combine the consensus score with one or several pure single model approaches. The performance of the best quasi-single approaches often match the performance of the consensus methods, but with the ability to evaluate a single model at a time given that a set of external predictions exist.</p>
<p>Below we will first describe shortly the methods used by our groups in CASP12. Thereafter, we will compare their performance and discuss our insights about their pros and cons.</p>

<p>We participated with several accuracy estimation methods in CASP12. Here, we will highlight the two methods that performed best; the single model accuracy estimation tool ProQ3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and our consensus based method Pcons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Our other methods included an early version of ProQ3D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> the deep learning version of ProQ3. ProQ3&#x005F;diso is a version of ProQ3 where disordered residues are ignored and RSA&#x005F;SS is a simple quality assessment method that only utilizes predicted secondary structure and surface area. For details see the abstract of CASP12.</p>
<p><bold>ProQ3</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> is the latest version of our single model accuracy estimation methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>&#x201D;, see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for a description of the most important developments in the history of ProQ. In addition to using the same descriptions of a model as ProQ2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> it also uses Rosetta energy functions. All input features are combined together to train a linear SVM. The training data set is a subset of CASP9 with 30 models per target. We also tested a few developmental methods of ProQ in CASP12, but none of these performed significantly better than ProQ3 and are therefore not discussed here. However, it can be noted that we have recently developed an improved version of ProQ3, ProQ3D that uses a deep-learning approach but identical inputs as ProQ3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The final version was not ready for CASP12 and the preliminary version used did not perform better than ProQ3. ProQ3 is available both as source code from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/ElofssonLab/proq3">https://bitbucket.org/ElofssonLab/proq3</ext-link>, and as a web-server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proq3.bioinfo.se/">http://proq3.bioinfo.se/</ext-link>.</p>

<p><bold>Pcons</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> is used with default setting. This means that the score is calculated by performing a structural superposition using the algorithm described by Levitt and Gerstein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> of a model against all other models. To avoid bias, comparison between models from the same method are ignored. After superposition, the &#x201C;S-score&#x201D; is calculated for each residue in the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The average S-score for all residues and pairs of models is then used to calculate the final Pcons score. For local predictions, the average S-score is converted to a distance as described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Pcons is freely available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/biomwallner/Pcons/">https://github.com/biomwallner/Pcons/</ext-link>. It should be noted that a number of heuristic optimizations have been implemented in Pcons to enable the pairwise comparison of hundreds of proteins in a short time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We participated in CASP12 with 3 new quasi-single model method variants, ModFOLD6, ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor and ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and one older clustering method, ModFOLDclust2.</p>

<title>ModFOLD6</title>
<p>The ModFOLD6 server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> is the latest version of our freely available public resource for the accuracy estimation of 3D models of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The ModFOLD6 server combines a pure-single and quasi-single model strategy for improving accuracy of local and global model accuracy estimates. Our initial motivation in the development of ModFOLD6 was to increase the accuracy of local/per-residue assessments for single models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For the local/per-residue error estimates, each model was considered individually using 2 new pure-single model methods, the Contact Distance Agreement (CDA) and the Secondary Structure Agreement (SSA) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, as well as the method, ProQ2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, 3 alternative quasi-single model methods were used to score models including: the newly developed Disorder B-factor Agreement (DBA), the ModFOLD5&#x005F;single (MF5s) and the ModFOLDclustQ&#x005F;single scores (MFcQs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> - each of which made use of a set of 130 reference 3D models that were generated using the latest version of the IntFOLD-TS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> pipeline from the IntFOLD server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The component per-residue scores from each of the 6 alternative scoring methods, mentioned above, were combined into a single score for each residue using an Artificial Neural Network, which was trained to learn the local S-score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> as the target function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (i.e. the same target function as ProQ2, described above was used, but with d<sub>0</sub> set to 3.9).</p>
<p>For global scoring, in the ModFOLD6 variant we simply took the mean local score for each model (i.e. the sum of the per-residues scores divided by the target sequence length). However in our internal benchmarks, using CASP11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and CAMEO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> data prior to CASP12, we realized that simply taking the mean per-residue score from ModFOLD6 alone was not optimal and performance differed depending on the intended use case, i.e. selecting the best models (ranking) or accurately reproducing the model-target similarity scores (correlations). Therefore we also exhaustively explored all linear combinations of each of the alternative global scores, in order to find the optimal mean score (OMS) for each major use case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor</title>
<p>The aim of developing the ModFOLD&#x005F;cor global score variant was to optimize the correlations of predicted and observed global scores i.e. the predicted global accuracy estimation scores produced by the method should be close to linear correlations with the observed global accuracy estimation scores. The OMS for the ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor global score was found as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="143925_ueqn1.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where the &#x005F;global suffix indicates that the mean local score was taken for the scoring method indicated above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank</title>
<p>The aim of developing the ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank global score variant was to optimise for the selection of the best models i.e. the top ranked models (top 1) should be closer to the highest accuracy, regardless of the relationship between the absolute values of predicted and observed scores. The OMS for the ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank global score was found as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="143925_ueqn2.gif"/>
</alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Note that the local scores submitted for each of the 3 ModFOLD6 variants were identical and it was only the global scores (and therefore the ranking of models), which differed between the 3 ModFOLD6 variants. All three of the ModFOLD6 variants are freely available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/ModFOLD6_form.html">http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/ModFOLD6_form.html</ext-link></p>

<title>ModFOLDclust2</title>
<p>The ModFOLDclust2 method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> is a leading automatic clustering based approach for both local and global 3D model accuracy estimation assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The ModFOLDclust2 server tested during CASP12 was identical to that tested during the CASP9, CASP10&#x0026; CASP11 experiments. The local and global scores have been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and are unchanged since CASP9. Thus, the ModFOLDclust2 method serves as a useful gold standard/benchmark against which progress in the development of single model methods may be measured. ModFOLDclust2 can be run as an option via the older ModFOLD3 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/ModFOLD_form_3_0.html">http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/ModFOLD_form_3_0.html</ext-link>).

<p>We participated in CASP12 with two EMA methods, MESHI-score (implemented by the MESHI&#x005F;server group) and MESHI-score-con (MESHI&#x005F;con&#x005F;server), the latter is a slight variation on the former. Below we first present the general scheme, which is used by both methods, and then conclude with the variations, tried in MESHI-score-con.</p>
<p>While preliminary versions of MESHI-score were used in CASP10 and CASP11, it has reached stability only after CASP11 in <italic>Mirzaei et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</italic> The software architecture, however, is modular, extendable by design, and under continuous development. Thus, the version that took part in CASP12 was more advanced than the one presented earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The MESHI-score pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) starts with a regularization step that includes sidechain repacking by SCWRL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and restrained energy minimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>II</italic>). This step sharpens the quality signal of structural features by reducing noise, which is due to peculiarities of decoy generating methods. Features are extracted from the regularized structures and fed to an ensemble of independently trained predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>IV</italic>). Each predictor outputs a pair of values: an EMA score and weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>VI</italic>), and the weighted median of this set of pairs is the final MESHI-score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>VII</italic>). In addition, we also calculate the weighted interdecile range and entropy of the pairs set. The larger these numbers are the less reliable is the score, as they suggest disagreement between the predictors.</p>

<p>The predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>V</italic>) are nonlinear functions that get feature vectors as an input and output a pair of numbers: an EMA score, and a weight that represents the reliability of the score. The parameters of the predictor functions, as well as the subset of features that they use, are learned by stochastic optimization. Each predictor, is trained to minimize a different objective function and thus tend to be more sensitive in a specific GDT&#x005F;TS subrange (e.g., [0.4 - 0.7]). Scores within the predictor&#x2019;s sensitivity region are considered more reliable and thus, have a higher weight. A more detailed description of the predictor&#x2019;s training may be found in Mirzaei et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>MESHI-score-con is a variant on the MESHI-score theme, which aims to improve the consistency MESHI-score by a post processing step that takes into account the similarities between decoys. Ideally, after regularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>II</italic>) very similar decoys should produce similar feature vectors, and thus have similar MESHI-scores. Yet, careful examination of MESHI-score results indicates that this is not always the case, and often very similar decoys have quite different scores. MESHI-score-con aims to alleviate this problem by improving the agreement between the scores of very similar decoys. To this end, we associate the MESHI-score of each decoy with a weight, which is inversely proportional to the entropy of the score-weight pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <italic>VII</italic>). We also associate each decoy with a neighbors-set that includes very similar (GDT&#x005F;TS &#x003E;&#x003D; 95) neighbors as well as the decoy itself. MESHI-score-con is a weighted average of the decoy&#x2019;s MESHI-score and the average score of its neighbor-set. Thus, a low weight decoy (presumably a less reliable one) with higher weight neighbors is strongly biased towards the average score of its neighbors. Yet the score of a decoy without neighbors is unaffected regardless of its weight. Thus, unlike consensus methods MESHI-score-con may pick an exceptionally good decoy.</p>

<p>We participated in CASP12 with two methods, namely SVMQA and quasi-SVMQA (qSVMQA). qSVMQA augments TM-score between GOAL&#x005F;TS1 and the server model with an appropriate value of weight <italic>w</italic> to the SVMQA score:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="143925_ueqn3.gif"/>
</alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>The value of <italic>w</italic> was set separately for stage1 models (0.84) and for stage2 models (0.15). Below, we briefly describe SVMQA and highlight its results in the model selection of Stage2 targets in CASP12.</p>
<p>SVMQA is a support-vector-machine-based protein single-model global QA method. SVMQA predicts the global QA score as the average of the predicted TM-score and GDT&#x005F;TS score by combining two separate predictors, SVMQA&#x005F;GDT and SVMQA&#x005F;TM. For SVMQA we used 19 features (8 potential energy-based terms and 11 consistency-based terms between the predicted and actual values of the model) for predicting the QA score (TM-score or GDT&#x005F;TS score). Among these 19 features, 3 features (orientation dependent energy, GOAP angular energy and solvent accessibility consistency score) was not used in earlier versions, while the other 16 have been used in existing methods. The description of each feature along with the selection of the final set of SVM parameters and the final set of features for these two predictors have been published recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In short, SVMQA&#x005F;TM uses all of the 19 features to predict TM-score of a given model, whereas SVMQA&#x005F;GDT uses only 15 features to predict the GDT&#x005F;TS score.</p>
<p>In CASP11, we used our old QA method, RFMQA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The result of RFMQA on CASP11 targets was quite successful but not as good as that of SVMQA on CASP12 targets. Prior to CASP12, we benchmarked the performance of SVMQA on CASP11 targets and compared it to that of RFMQA, and we found that SVMQA significantly outperformed RFMQA in terms of both ranking models and selecting a more native-like model. The major updates of SVMQA over RFMQA is as follow: (i) The choice of machine learning method was different, an SVM (support vector machine) was used in SVMQA while a random forest was used in RFMQA; (ii) we used CASP8-9 domain targets as the training dataset for RFMQA, while CASP8-10 domain targets were used in SVMQA; (iii) 19 input features were used in SVMQA, whereas, only 9 of these features were used in RFMQA; (iv) The objective function to train for RFMQA was TM<sub>loss</sub> (difference between the TM-score of the selected model and the best TM-score), while that for SVMQA was the correlation coefficient between the actual ranking and the predicted ranking; and (v) SVMQA used two separate predictors for TM-score and GDT&#x005F;TS score, while RFMQA used only a predictor for TM-score.</p>

<p>ProQ2 has participated, in principle unchanged, in CASP since CASP10. Before CASP11 we implemented ProQ2 as a scoring function in Rosetta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, enabling scoring and integration in any Rosetta protocol. ProQ2 was top-ranked in both CASP10 and CASP11, which inspired developers of novel methods (e.g. SVMQA, MESHI-score) to use ProQ2 performance as the state-of-the-art method that they aim to beat. It also led to development of hybrid methods incorporating ProQ2 directly for improved model accuracy estimation, laying the foundation for the improvement we see in some of the top-ranked methods in the current CASP12, e.g. ProQ3, Wallner (Pcomb, see below), the ModFOLD6 server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> in QA prediction, and the BAKERROSETTA-SERVER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and the IntFOLD4 server (See accompanying paper about TBM paper in this issue) for TS prediction.</p>
<p><bold>Wallner</bold> method in this CASP was the Pcomb method that combines ProQ2 and Pcons using the linear combination

<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="143925_ueqn6.gif"/>
</alternatives></disp-formula>
for global prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For local prediction the same formula was used to calculate a weighted local S-scores that then were converted to distances using the same formula as above.</p>
<p><bold>Pcomb-domain</bold> method is a new domain-based version of Pcomb. Traditionally, consensus methods, including Pcons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bjornwallner/pcons">https://github.com/bjomwallner/pcons</ext-link>), have always used rigid-body superposition for the full-length models, thereby selecting models that overall have the highest consensus with everything else. Simply ignoring the fact that smaller domains from other models actually could have a better consensus over that particular domain. To overcome that problem in CASP12, we developed a domain-based version of Pcons that was based on an initial domain definition runs Pcons for each domain separately. The domain-based Pcons scores were combined with the local predicted scores from ProQ2. Two different methods were used to predict the domain boundaries of the target sequences, the first used the domain definitions from the Robetta server and the second was based on spectral analysis of the top ranking server models according to the regular Pcomb method. The results from these two methods were manually evaluated to decide the final domain boundaries. In addition, the Pcons and ProQ2 scores were weighted in a slightly different way compared the regular Pcomb method; following a parameter optimization based on targets released in the last two editions of CASP the relative weight for ProQ2 was increased to:

<p>Furthermore, the d<sub>0</sub> was increased from 3.0&#x00C5; to 5.0&#x00C5;. As for both ProQ2 and Pcomb all prediction are performed in S-score space, global scores are sum of local scores, and the local S scores are transformed to distances in the final step, using the d<sub>i</sub>(S<sub>i</sub>) formula above.</p>

<title>Global accuracy estimations in CASP12</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the accompanying paper shows the accuracy of CASP12 methods in selecting the best model according to the GDT&#x005F;TS score. Three single model accuracy estimation methods are ranked at the top in terms of identifying the best model with the average error (i.e., difference between the GDT&#x005F;TS of the selected model and the best GDT&#x005F;TS) under 5 GDT&#x005F;TS units. The individual ranking of these methods depends on the evaluation criteria and according to the accompanying paper the difference between the top methods isnot significant. The best consensus and quasi-single methods are only slightly worse than the pure single methods using these criteria. However, this is a significant progress since last CASP.</p>
<p>In the accompanying paper <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the ability to distinguish between good and bad models is evaluated. Here, it is clear that the best methods combine consensus or quasi-single with single model methods. All the top three methods are using the single model method ProQ2 as part of the their scoring. Wallner and Pcomb-domain are weighted sums with the Pcons score, while ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank uses it as part of many other scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Still, even though the top methods are statistically better, the much simpler pure consensus methods Pcons and ModFOLDclust2 are not far behind ranked 6th and 9th, see Table 3 in the accompanying paper.</p>
<p>The ability of methods to rank the top models for each target was evaluated using the per target correlation, i.e. the correlation of estimated and observed accuracy for each target. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the distribution of per target correlation for the methods studied here and the three different accuracy estimation measures are shown. The distributions are sorted by the median. It can be seen that the individual rankings of the methods are quite different depending on which accuracy measure that is used. When using GDT&#x005F;TS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, consensus and quasi-single based methods clearly outperform the single model accuracy estimation methods. In contrast when using CAD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> or 1DDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> the best correlation is obtained with ProQ3 and all the top methods are single model accuracy estimations. A similar difference in ranking can be seen in the AUC analysis on the CASP homepage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://predictioncenter.org/casp12/qa&#x005F;aucmcc.cgi">http://predictioncenter.org/casp12/qa&#x005F;aucmcc.cgi</ext-link>). In AUC ProQ3 is ranked as 20th when using GDT&#x005F;TS but as 7th when using CAD. In contrast Pcons is ranked as 4th using GDT&#x005F;TS and as 12th using CAD. Interestingly, it can be seen that the &#x201C;pure&#x201D; consensus methods (Pcons, MODFOLDClust2) shown in dark grey that do not combine the consensus score with other scores show only a modest per target correlation with CAD or 1DDT.</p>

<title>Comparison of global accuracy estimation predictions</title>
<p>How similar are the different model accuracy estimation scores produced by the different methods? To answer this we calculated the correlation between all accuracy estimations for all models evaluated by all methods, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It can be seen that all methods (except qSVMQA) that use some sort of consensus (quasi-single or consensus) are clustered. Within this group the separation is primarily not between quasi-single methods and consensus methods, but rather between the methods that primarily use consensus and those who combine the consensus score with ProQ2. Pcomb-domain, ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank, Wallner, and ModFOLD6 all use ProQ2 as part of their scoring and they all cluster together, while ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor is more similar to the pure consensus methods (Pcons and ModFOLDclust2) than the other combined methods as it does not use ProQ2 global scores directly in its classification. Since the combined methods include single methods they are also more similar to all the single methods than the pure consensus methods.</p>

It can be noted that (i) both quasi, pure and combined consensus methods are very similar (Cc&#x003E;0.94), while the single model quality methods are more different (Cc&#x003C;0.90 between the groups). ProQ2 is the real outlier only having a Cc&#x003E;0.82 to ProQ3 and the consensus methods that uses ProQ2 as a part of their score. In fact ProQ2 and ProQ3 are less similar to each other than any pair of consensus based methods. It can also be noted that the combined methods are more similar to the single-model methods than the pure consensus methods (Pcons, ModFOLDClust2).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="143925_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Among the single model accuracy estimation methods it is clear that SVMQA shows the least similarity with the others. SVMQA is actually more similar to the consensus methods than to any other single model accuracy estimation method. ProQ3 is something of a link between MESHI and ProQ2 showing higher correlation to both of them than they share. Most likely because both ProQ3 and MESHI use similar, but not identical, energy terms as part of their scoring; ProQ3 uses terms derived from Rosetta&#x2019;s energy function, many of which have a similarities to the MESHI energy terms (see above). It can also be noted that in general ProQ2 is the outlier, showing the lowest correlation with the consensus methods.</p>
<p>When comparing the three different quality measurements it can be seen that they do not correlate with each other better than the correlation between consensus methods and GDT&#x005F;TS. The correlation between CAD and GDT&#x005F;TS is 0.88 and all consensus methods show a higher correlation to GDT&#x005F;TS than that. As mentioned above some of the problems might origin from domain division, but it is clear that the model quality estimation accuracy is rivaling the ability to accurately estimate the quality of a model.</p>

<title>Local accuracy estimation in CASP12</title>
<p>In terms of estimation of local accuracy, the best performance is obtained by the pure consensus methods followed by quasi-single model approaches, see assessment paper <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Table 4. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> a heat map of all local predictions by the methods discussed in this paper is shown. Unfortunately, of the single predictors only ProQ2 and ProQ3 produce local predictions, nevertheless the trend is still the same as for the global methods. All the consensus and quasi-single methods provide very similar accuracy estimates, while the two single methods are less similar. It is also clear from this analysis that the consensus methods clearly correlate better with the real error (as measured by S-score) better than the single methods (&#x003E;0.8 vs &#x003C;0.7).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Below we will continue the CASP style of presentations by highlighting what each group learned during CASP12.</p>
<sec id="s2g1">
<title>What the Elofsson group learned</title>
<p>An interesting trend in CASP12 is that ProQ3 is better than our consensus method, Pcons, at picking up the best model (see accompanying paper). In earlier CASPs this was not the case and until CASP10 it was clear that consensus based methods were superior even in this aspect. We do believe that the main reason for this is that single model accuracy estimation methods have actually improved quite dramatically in the last few years.</p>
<p>However, still consensus-based methods such as Pcons are clearly superior at separating correct and incorrect models (see accompanying paper). Interestingly, when using CAD ProQ3 performs slightly better than Pcons even on this measure, indicating that some part of the superior performance of consensus methods is due to multi-domain properties of the targets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>One issue at CASP is that the definition of the target function for local prediction used in CASP might not be ideal. The goal is to predict the error in distance for a particular residue. However, this is dependent on the superposition used, which can be problematic for multi-domain targets. It could therefore be useful to consider changing the target to predict one of the non-superposition based accuracy evaluation methods, such as CAD or 1DDT. However, we have not evaluated this as the stated goal in CASP12 was to predict the distance after superposition. Also the difference between single model estimators and the consensus ones for local quality estimation is quite large and changing the error definition would most likely not change that.</p>

<sec id="s2g2">
<title>What the Keasar group learned</title>
<p>The major rationale behind the design of MESHI-score pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is to keep the feature set painlessly extendable. To this end we employed an ensemble learning scheme, in which the feature selection is part of the training of each predictor (i.e. ensemble member). This way each feature has a &#x201C;fair chance&#x201D; to be included in some of the predictors and provide its unique contribution to the overall score. Overfitting at the single predictor level is avoided by restricting the number of selected features. Combining the set of predictor scores to form the single ensemble score (MESHI-score) does not require any adjustable parameters and thus, does not introduce overfitting at the ensemble level. In this experiment we put to test the modularity of our ensemble learning approach. Indeed, in this experiment we were able to get better results than before, simply by adding more features to the same machinery, with neither considerable computational burden nor overfitting. This encourages us to work on the development and adoption of more informative features.</p>
<p>In CASP12 we also tested MESHI-score-con for the first time, and its performance was a bit superior to that of MESHI-score. We take this as a proof of concept and wish to extend it in two directions: have a data-driven less restricted definition of the neighbors set, and apply the same idea also to decoys of high score. High scores to two dissimilar decoys must imply that at least one of them (often both) is wrong.</p>

<sec id="s2g3">
<title>What the Lee group learned</title>
<p>According to the CASP12 assessment, SVMQA is one of the best method for selecting good quality models from a set of given decoys in terms of GDT-LOSS. The newly implemented features (five potential energy-based terms and consistency-based terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> a systematic benchmarking approach on the selection of the final set of features, the optimization of machine learning parameters on a balanced training and testing dataset, and the usage of two separate predictors made SVMQA to perform significantly better than our old method used in CASP11 (RFMQA) when benchmarked on CASP11 targets. Additionally, SVMQA made valuable contribution to our server (GOAL) and human predictions (LEE and LEElab) of CASP12 in terms of model selection. In terms of the model selection, SVMQA performed well, however, in term of assigning proper absolute global accuracy value to a model it didn&#x2019;t perform as desired (see the CASP12 assessment paper). We believe that one way to improve on estimating the absolute score of a given model is to consider other types of objective functions to train separately for absolute global accuracy, which is one of the goals that we should work on for the next CASP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g4">
<title>What the McGuffin group learned</title>
<p>The ModFOLD6 series of methods (ModFOLD6, ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank and ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor) perform particularly well in terms of assigning absolute global accuracy values. As expected the ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor variant is the best of these. The ModFOLD6 series of methods also perform competitively with clustering approaches for differentiating between good and bad models; the ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank method being the best of these, which is only outperformed by two clustering groups (Wallner and Pcomb-domain). Furthermore, as we anticipated, the ModFOLD6&#x005F;rank variant is better at selecting the top models than the ModFOLD6 and ModFOLD6&#x005F;cor variants, however it is outperformed by the latest pure-single model methods. Overall, in terms of global scores, the ModFOLD6 variants rank within the top three methods for nearly every global benchmark according to LDDT and CAD scores, as well as ranking within the top 10 according to other scores.</p>
<p>It is gratifying to see progress in CASP12 from many groups in both pure-single and quasi-single model approaches to estimate model accuracy. However, it is also clear there is still room for improvement of our methods. For instance, we are outperformed in terms of model selection by the newer pure single model methods. Further integration of methods is probably needed. Different methods are clearly better suited for different aspects of model accuracy estimation, therefore all approaches to the problem are still important to pursue. Perhaps the most difficult problem faced by all groups is how to optimize a global score for all aspects of model accuracy estimation, as there seems to be no one-size-fits-all solution presently. One potential solution to this might be to use a deep learning approach that outputs multiple scores depending on the intended use case. A global score for ranking models on a per-target basis, irrespective of the observed model-target similarity scores, is clearly very useful, if it can consistently select the better models. On the other hand a global score that can produce a near 1:1 mapping between predicted and observed scores, that is consistent across all targets, will allow us to assign accurate confidence scores to individual models (which is arguably more useful to an experimentalist than a top ranked, but nevertheless poor quality, model). Of course, as model accuracy estimation methods continue to improve and approach perfect optimisation for each use case, eventually the scores will converge on a single answer.</p>

<title>What the Wallner group learned</title>
<p>Pcomb-domain was the best method for differentiating between good and bad models (see assessment paper <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the true advantage of Pcomb-domain can only be seen if the assessment is performed based on domains or using superposition independent evaluation measures like 1DDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and CAD-score <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Since this analysis is lacking in the official assessment, we calculated the local residue correlation based on either full-length target or target domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For full-length assessment, methods based on global structural superposition (Wallner, Pcons,and ModFOLDclust2) for single domains are indeed superior. Also the performance based on multi-domain targets seems to be better for these methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, the reason for this seemingly good performance for multi-domain targets is an artifact of the full-length assessment on multi-domain proteins that will only superimpose on one domain, if the domain-domain orientation is wrong. In effect, assigning high quality scores to the residues from one domain (usually the larger), and relatively low quality scores to the residues from other domains. This effect accentuates the performance for prediction methods using global superposition, which will also predict high quality scores for one domain and low scores for the others. If instead the assessment is performed using the official CASP domain definitions, this artifact can be avoided, and then it is clear that Pcomb-domain performs better for multi-domain targets, and better than other methods when it gets the domain prediction correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Unfortunately, this was only achieved for 6 out of 21 multi-domain targets. However, considering that we did not have any time optimizing the domain partition algorithm for this particular task before CASP12, there should be clear room for improvement by improving the domain partition algorithm.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is our belief that the most important insight from the QA groups in CASP12 is the progress in single model accuracy estimations. Three new methods, SVMQA, MESHI and ProQ3, are all better than the best single model method in CASP11 (ProQ2). It is now clear that these methods are best at selecting the top-ranked model. However, quasi-single method and consensus methods are still superior when it comes to distinguishing correct and incorrect models and for local predictions. In those targets that have a wide spread of quality there is a clear distinction between the correlations of single and consensus methods with the later performing better. These are typically subunit of protein complexes, for which templates are available. Here, estimating the accuracy of a single model might not make sense without taking the entire complex into account. In CASP12 this is most dramatic with target T0865, where correlations for consensus based methods are high and correlations for all single model methods are negative. By comparing the predictions to each other it is seen that all consensus and quasi-single methods actually are very similar, while there is larger variation between the single methods, i.e. combining them might provide additional value in the future.</p>
