<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Chemotherapy is a principle tool for the control and prevention of piroplasmosis. The search for a new chemotherapy against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites has become increasingly urgent due to the toxic side effects of and developed resistance to the current drugs. Chalcones have attracted much attention due to their diverse biological activities. With the aim to discover new drugs and drug targets, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> antibabesial activity of <italic>trans</italic>-chalcone (TC) and chalcone hydrate (CH) alone and combined with diminazene aceturate (DA), clofazimine (CF) and atovaquone (AQ) were investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
<p>The fluorescence-based assay was used for evaluating the inhibitory effect of TC and CH on five of <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> species, including <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, <italic>B. divergens</italic>, <italic>B. caballi</italic>, and <italic>T. equi</italic>, the combination with DA, CF, and AQ on <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, and on the multiplication of a <italic>B. microti</italic>&#x2013;infected mouse model. The cytotoxicity of compounds was tested on Madin&#x2013; Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3), and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cell lines. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of TC and CH against <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, <italic>B. divergens</italic>, <italic>B. caballi</italic>, and <italic>T. equi</italic> were 69.6 &#x00B1; 2.3, 33.3 &#x00B1; 1.2, 64.8 &#x00B1; 2.5, 18.9 &#x00B1; 1.7, and 14.3 &#x00B1; 1.6 &#x00B5;M and 138.4 &#x00B1; 4.4, 60.9 &#x00B1; 1.1, 82.3 &#x00B1; 2.3, 27.9 &#x00B1; 1.2, and 19.2 &#x00B1; 1.5 &#x00B5;M, respectively. In toxicity assays, TC and CH affected the viability of MDBK, NIH/3T3, and HFF cell lines the with half maximum effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of 293.9 &#x00B1; 2.9, 434.4 &#x00B1; 2.7, and 498 &#x00B1; 3.1 &#x00B5;M and 252.7 &#x00B1; 1.7, 406.3 &#x00B1; 9.7, and 466 &#x00B1; 5.7 &#x00B5;M, respectively. In the mouse experiment, TC reduced the peak parasitemia of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>microti</italic> by 71.8&#x0025; when administered intraperitoneally at 25 mg/kg. Combination therapies of TC&#x2013;diminazene aceturate and TC&#x2013;clofazimine were more potent against <italic>B. microti</italic> infection in mice than their monotherapies.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
<p>In conclusion, both TC and CH inhibited the growth of <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria in vitro</italic>, and TC inhibited the growth of <italic>B. microti in vivo.</italic> Therefore, TC and CH could be candidates for the treatment of piroplasmosis after further studies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Protozoa of the genus <italic>Babesia</italic> are the second most common blood-borne parasites of mammals after the trypanosomes. <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> are the etiological agents of piroplasmosis, a tick-transmitted disease causing substantial losses of livestock and companion animals worldwide and has recently gained attention as one of the emerging zoonosis in humans. Diminazene aceturate and imidocarb dipropionate are still the first choices for the treatment of animals. However, these drugs cause many adverse effects. Furthermore, they are not approved for human medicine. Therefore, the development of alternative treatment remedies against babesiosis is urgently required. In the present study we evaluated the effects chalcone hydrate (CH) and <italic>trans</italic>-chalcone (TC), against the growth of four species of <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>T. equi.</italic> Furthermore, we studied the chemotherapeutic potential of TC on <italic>B. microti</italic> in mice. The effects of the combined treatment of TC with DA, CF and AQ revealed that TC was found to diminish the adverse effects of these drugs</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Babesiosis is one of the most severe infections of animals worldwide and has recently gained attention as one of the emerging zoonosis in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. <italic>Babesia bovis</italic>, <italic>Babesia bigemina</italic>, and <italic>Babesia divergens</italic> infect cattle and cause bovine babesiosis. Of these, <italic>B. bovis</italic> is much more virulent than <italic>B. bigemina</italic> and <italic>B. divergens</italic> due to its ability to sequestrate in the capillaries, causing hypotensive shock syndrome and neurological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In horses, <italic>Babesia caballi</italic> and <italic>Theileria equi</italic> (formerly <italic>Babesia equi</italic>) infect horses, causing equine piroplasmosis. <italic>T. equi</italic> parasitizes leucocytes and erythrocytes for the completion of its life cycle, causing anemia, weight loss, lethargy, and fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], whereas <italic>B. caballi</italic> directly infects horse erythrocytes in a manner similar to <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. bigemina</italic> in cattle. Human babesiosis is caused by <italic>Babesia microti</italic> in North America, while in Europe, it is caused by <italic>Babesia divergens</italic>. Human babesiosis manifests as an apparently silent infection to a fulminant, malaria-like disease, resulting occasionally in the death of the infected individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Prevention of babesiosis relies on vector control, vaccination, and chemotherapy. Thus far, chemotherapy has been the most successful method due to the availability of efficacious compounds such as diminazene aceturate and imidocarb dipropionate for animals and atovaquone, azithromycin clindamycin, and quinine for humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, atovaquone-resistant <italic>Babesia gibsoni</italic> has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Mosqueda et al. (2012)</xref> reported the emergence of parasites resistant to diminazene aceturate (DA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, research to discover new drugs and drug targets is the fundamental approach toward addressing current limitations.</p>
<p>Chalcones (<italic>trans</italic>-1, 3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones) are natural products belonging to the flavonoid family that are widespread in plants and are considered as intermediate in the flavonoid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. They are recognized for their broad-spectrum biological activities, including antimalarial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], anticancer, antileishmanial, antitrypanosomal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, antifilarial, antifungal, antimicrobial, larvicidal, and anticonvulsant ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Based on the wide range of pharmacological effects, it is implied that chalcones have several modes of action in different parasites. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Go et al. (2004)</xref> showed that chalcones modulate the permeability pathways of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected erythrocyte membrane, affecting its growth and multiplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Fr&#x00F6;lich et al. (2005) showed that chalcones inhibit glutathione (GSH)-dependent haemin degradation and binding to the active site of the cysteine protease (falcipain) enzyme involved in hemoglobin degradation in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Chalcones inhibit the components of mitochondrial respiratory chain <italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic> complex (ubiquinol&#x2013;cytochrome c reductase) (UQCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Additionally, chalcones inhibit the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) (Pfmrk and PfPK) and plasmepsin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. These various pathways demonstrate the importance of chalcones as chemotherapeutic candidates against malaria. However, the effect of chalcones had never been evaluated against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of chalcones, namely, chalcone hydrate (CH) and <italic>trans</italic>-chalcone (TC), against the growth of <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, <italic>B. divergens</italic>, <italic>B. caballi</italic>, and <italic>T. equi in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, we studied the chemotherapeutic potential of TC on <italic>B. microti</italic> in mice.</p>

<title>Cultivation of parasites <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>The purified bovine red blood cells (RBCs) were used to maintain <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, and <italic>B. divergens</italic>, and the purified equine RBCs were used to maintain <italic>B. caballi</italic> and <italic>T. equi</italic>.

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> growth inhibitory effects</title>
<p>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for CH, TC, DA, AQ, and CF was determined using the fluorescence assay as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Briefly, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 &#x00B5;M CH and TC and 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 &#x03BC;M DA, AQ, and CF were used to determine the inhibition concentration in a 96-well plate with a 2.5&#x0025; hematocrit for <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. bigemina</italic> and a 5&#x0025; hematocrit for <italic>B. divergens</italic>, <italic>B. caballi</italic>, and <italic>T. equi</italic>. The plates were cultivated for 4 days without changing the media. On day 4, 100 &#x00B5;L of lysis buffer containing 2&#x00D7;SG1 was directly added to each well and gently mixed by pipetting. The plate was wrapped in aluminum foil paper for protection from direct light and incubated for 6 h at room temperature. After that, the plates were placed into the fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluoroskan Ascent; Thermo Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA). The relative fluorescence values were read at 485 and 518 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Positive control wells containing infected red blood cells (iRBCs) and uninfected red blood cells (RBCs) were included as negative control wells. Gain values were set to percentages after subtraction of the mean values of the negative control and transferred into GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) to calculate the IC<sub>50</sub> value using the non-linear regression analysis (curve fit).</p>

<title>Morphological changes and viability experiment in vitro</title>
<p>The microscopy assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Five concentrations at 0.25&#x00D7;, 0.5&#x00D7;, 1&#x00D7;, 2&#x00D7;, and 4&#x00D7; the IC<sub>50</sub> of CH, TC, and DA were used for this experiment. A 100 &#x00B5;L reaction volume containing 90 &#x00B5;L of respective media and 10 &#x00B5;L of iRBCs normalized to 1&#x0025; parasitemia was incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate at 37&#x00BA;C in a humidified multi-gas water-jacketed incubator. The 90 &#x00B5;L of media was changed daily and replaced with 90 &#x00B5;L of new media containing the same concentration of drugs (CH or TC) for 4 consecutive days. In the course of the 4 days of treatment, Giemsa-stained thin blood smears were prepared, and the parasitemia in 10,000 RBCs was monitored every 24 h. On the 5<sup>th</sup> day, 3 &#x00B5;L of RBCs from each well was mixed with 7 &#x00B5;L of fresh RBCs, transferred into a new 96-well microtiter plate, and cultured in drug-free media. The media were replaced every day, and the parasitemia was monitored every 2 days until 6 days after the last treatment. The viability of drug-treated parasites was checked in the blood smear for 6 days after the last treatment. The presence of parasites was recorded as positive (relapse), and the absence of parasites was recorded as negative (total parasite clearance). Each experiment was performed in triplicate in three separate trials. The morphological changes were observed under a light microscope, and micrographs were captured using Nikon Digital Sight <sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (Nikon Corporation, Japan).</p>

<title>Combination treatment using CH or TC with DA, AQ, or CF in vitro</title>
<p>The combination studies were performed in accordance with the previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Three sets of duplicate wells with five selected concentrations of CH, TC, DA, AQ, and CF at 0.25&#x00D7;, 0.5&#x00D7;, 1&#x00D7;, 2&#x00D7;, and 4&#x00D7; the IC<sub>50</sub> were loaded in a 96-well plate. The first set of wells contained concentrations of single CH treatments, the second set contained concentrations of single DA or AQ or CF treatment, and the third set contained the combination of CH with DA, AQ, or CF at a constant ratio (1:1). The same experiment was repeated for TC with DA, AQ, and CF in three separate trials. The cultivation was performed for 4 days in a 100 &#x00B5;L reaction volume of media containing the drug concentrations and a hematocrit of 2.5&#x0025; for <italic>B. bovis</italic> and <italic>B. bigemina</italic> and 5&#x0025; for <italic>B. divergens</italic>, <italic>B. caballi</italic>, and <italic>T. equi</italic>. On day 4, 100 &#x00B5;L of lysis buffer containing 2&#x00D7;SG1 was added. The plate was wrapped with aluminum foil for protection from light and incubated at room temperature for 6 h. The plates were then loaded into a fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the relative fluorescence values were read at 485 and 518 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The obtained fluorescence values were set to percentages after subtraction of the mean values of the negative control. The growth inhibition values obtained were entered into CompuSyn software<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (ComboSyn, Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] for calculation of the degree of association based on the combination index (CI) values. The CI values of the drug combination were determined using the formula [(1&#x00D7;IC<sub>50</sub>) &#x002B; (2&#x00D7;IC<sub>75</sub>) &#x002B; (3&#x00D7;IC<sub>90</sub>) &#x002B; (4&#x00D7;IC<sub>95</sub>)]/10, and the drug combination was considered synergistic if the value was less than 0.90, additive if the value was 0.90&#x2013;1.10, and antagonistic if the value was more than 1.10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<p>Madin&#x2013;Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3), and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cell lines were cultured continuously at 37&#x00BA;C in a humidified incubator with 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. MDBK cell line was maintained in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks with Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA), while Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle&#x2019;s Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA,USA) was used for NIH/3T3, and HFF cell lines cultivation. Each medium was supplemented with 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum, 0.5&#x0025; penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and an additional 1&#x0025; glutamine. The medium was changed every 2 to 4 days and incubated until approximately 80&#x0025; confluent. The cells were checked by staining with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO, USA) to ensure free mycoplasma contamination. TrypLETM Express (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to allow cell detachment from the culture flask after washing two times with Dulbecco&#x2019;s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). Subsequently, viable cells were stained with 0.4&#x0025; trypan blue solution and then counted using a Neubauer improved C-Chip (NanoEnTek Inc., Seoul, Korea).</p>

<title>The chemotherapeutic effect of TC against <italic>B. microti</italic> in mice</title>
<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibitory effects of TC were evaluated against <italic>B. microti</italic> in mice as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Briefly, 50 female BALB/c mice at 8 weeks of age were caged in 10 groups (five mice/group). <italic>B. microti</italic> recovered from the frozen stock (stored at &#x2212;80&#x00BA;C) was thawed and injected into two mice intraperitoneally. The parasitemia was monitored daily via microscopy. The mice were sacrificed and blood collected by cardiac puncture when the parasitemia was over 40&#x0025;. The blood was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to obtain an inoculum containing 1&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup>/mL of <italic>B. microti</italic> iRBCs. The mice in groups 2&#x2013;10 received 0.5 mL intraperitoneal (IP) injections of the inoculum (1&#x00D7;10<sup>7</sup> <italic>B. microti</italic> iRBCs). Group 1 was left uninfected and untreated as a control. When the average parasitemia in all mice reached 1&#x0025;, drug treatment was initiated for 5 days. The mice in group 2 received sesame oil via IP injection as a control. Groups 3&#x2013;6 received a 25 mg/kg IP injection of TC, a 25 mg/kg IP injection of DA, oral administration of 20 mg/kg of AQ, and oral administration of 20 mg/kg of CF, respectively. Groups 7&#x2013;9 were treated with a combination of (12.5 mg/kg of TC and 12.5 mg/kg of DA), (12.5 mg/kg of TC and 10 mg/kg of AQ), and (12.5 mg/kg of TC and 10 mg/kg of CF), respectively, via a route similar to that for the single drug, while the mice in group 10 received DDW via IP injection as a control (infected and untreated mice). The parasitemia and blood parameters were monitored via microscopy and a hematology analyzer (Celltac &#x03B1; MEK-6450, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) every 2 and 4 days, respectively. The experiment was repeated twice. On day 45, blood was collected for PCR detection of the parasites.</p>

The cycling conditions were 94&#x00BA;C for 30 s denaturation, 53&#x00BA;C for 30 s annealing, and 72&#x00BA;C for 30 s as extension steps for 35 cycles, using the forward (5&#x2032;-CTTAGTATAAGCTTTTATACAGC-3&#x2032;) and reverse (5&#x2032;-ATAGGTCAGAAACTTGAATGATACA-3&#x2032;) primers. Afterward, 1 &#x00B5;L of the DNA template from the first PCR amplification was used as the template for the nPCR assays under similar cycling conditions, using the forward (5&#x2032;-GTTATAGTTTATTTGATGTTCGTTT-3&#x2032;) and reverse (5&#x2032;-AAGCCATGCGATTCGCTAAT-3&#x2032;) primers. After that, the PCR products were determined by electrophoresis in a 1.5&#x0025; agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under the UV Tran illuminator.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The treatment of bovine and equine piroplasmosis is limited to diminazene aceturate (DA) and imidocarb propionate, while clindamycin&#x2013;quinine and atovaquone&#x2013;azithromycin combinations have been utilized to manage human babesiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Unfortunately, toxic effects and resistance of the piroplasms against the current drug molecules have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. To overcome this challenge, research is urgently needed to discover new drug candidates and drug targets against piroplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the current study assessed the chemotherapeutic potential of CH and <italic>trans</italic>-chalcone (TC) against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>B. microti in vivo</italic>. Further, the effects of combining CH and TC with the currently available drugs, namely, AQ, CF, and DA, against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites were assessed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>In the current study, both CH and TC were effective against the <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites <italic>in vitro</italic> <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)</bold>. It is noteworthy that CH and TC were most effective against <italic>T. equi</italic>, followed by <italic>B. caballi</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, and <italic>B. divergens</italic>, whereas they were least effective against <italic>B. bovis</italic>. The IC<sub>50</sub> values shown by CH and TC against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites were comparable to those shown by CH and TC against <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, and <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This emphasizes that CH and TC are effective against many protozoan parasites. However, the mode of action has yet to be understood comprehensively in comparison with the existing data. In a previous study, Mi-Ichi et al. (2005) documented that chalcones are mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors that block ubiquinone (UQ) from binding to cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (<italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic>) in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites and exhibit potent antimalarial activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Torres-Santos et al. (2009) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al. (2001)</xref> reported that chalcones inhibit the growth of <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Trypanosomes</italic> by inhibiting the activity of fumarate reductase (FRD), one of the enzymes of the parasite respiratory chain that it is very important in the energy metabolism of the parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Since this enzyme is absent from mammalian cells, it could be an important target for drugs against protozoan parasites. Based on the previous findings, it is possible that chalcones also inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes in <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites, which could be elucidated in future studies.</p>
<p>The viability assay showed that TC and CH were more effective against <italic>Babesia</italic> parasites than against <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites. <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, and <italic>B. caballi</italic> could not relapse at 2&#x00D7;IC<sub>50</sub> treatments of TC, while <italic>B. divergens</italic> could not relapse at 4&#x00D7;IC<sub>50</sub> treatments of TC. <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, <italic>B. caballi</italic>, and <italic>B. divergens</italic> could not relapse at 4&#x00D7;IC<sub>50</sub> treatments of CH. In contrast, <italic>T. equi</italic> recovered even at 4&#x00D7;IC<sub>50</sub> treatments of CH and TC. This finding was similar to deductions by Tayebwa et al. (2018), who suggested that <italic>T. equi</italic> has better coping mechanisms than <italic>Babesia</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. However, the mechanism preventing <italic>T. equi</italic> from being completely killed by CH and TC remains unknown. In an attempt to visualize the morphological changes of CH- and TC-treated <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites, micrographs were taken at various incubation times. The observations showed deformed and dividing parasites and irregular parasite shapes at 24 h and pyknotic remnants within the iRBCs at 72 h <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>)</bold>. This showed that chalcones have a time-dependent effect on the <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites. Although the exact mode of action is yet to be elucidated, the parasites progressively lost their shape and became smaller. This could be attributed to the ability of chalcones to interfere with the metabolic pathway, as documented in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Combination chemotherapy has been recommended against drug-resistant protozoan and bacterial pathogens. Additionally, combination chemotherapy reduces drug dosages, thereby reducing their toxic side effects. Hence, the current study explored the combination of TC and CH with drugs such as DA, AQ, and CF <italic>in vitro</italic>. The findings of this study show that the effects of TC and CH combined with DA, AQ, or CF were either synergistic or additive against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites. The ability of TC and CH to combine with the current effective drugs is a property that can be explored in the development of chemotherapies against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. That study showed that the CF&#x2013;DA combination has additive effects on the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>B. bovis</italic>, <italic>B. bigemina</italic>, and <italic>B. caballi</italic> and synergistic effects on that of <italic>T. equi</italic>, and the combination chemotherapy with low-dose regimens of CF and DA has a more potent inhibitory effect on <italic>B. microti</italic> in mice than did their monochemotherapies. It is imperative that further studies are performed to confirm the mechanisms of TC and CH against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> so as to better understand the effect of interactions with other drugs such as DA, AQ, and CF.</p>
<p>The experiments to understand toxicity showed that CH and TC affected the viability of MDBK, NIH/3T3, and HFF cell lines with a dose-dependent inhibitory effect and a slightly high selectivity index. This finding is consistent with the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Echeverria et al. (2009)</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. They examined the cytotoxic activities of synthetic 2&#x2019;-hydroxychalcones against hepatocellular carcinoma cells, demonstrating that synthetic 2&#x2019;-hydroxychalcones show apoptosis induction and dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation without cytotoxic activities on normal cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Mi-Ichi et al. (2005) explained that the low cytotoxic activity of TC and CH against mammalian cell lines is attributed to the fact that the ubiquinol&#x2013; cytochrome c reductase (UQCR) and succinate ubiquinone reductase (SQR) of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mitochondria are different from those of the mammalian host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. With reference to the above, chalcones might be safe for use in animals and humans following further <italic>in vivo</italic> clinical studies.</p>
<p>The promising efficacy of TC <italic>in vitro</italic> prompted us to evaluate TC performance <italic>in vivo</italic>. TC administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 25 mg/kg resulted in a 71.8&#x0025; inhibition of the parasitemia on day 9 p.i. However, the inhibition rate was lower than those in the presence of 25 mg/kg DA, 20 mg/kg AQ, and 20 mg/kg CF, which were 92.5&#x0025;, 90.8&#x0025;, and 93.1&#x0025;, respectively <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>)</bold>. Certainly, the additive and synergistic effects in these combinations were indicated by the high degree of association observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, which prompted studies <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the TC&#x2013;DA and TC&#x2013;CF combinations were evaluated in mice to determine whether combination treatment would enable the reduction of DA, AQ, and CF dosages without altering the therapeutic efficacy against <italic>B. microti</italic> infection. Interestingly, the combination treatment of TC and DA at a dose of 12.5 &#x002B; 12.5 mg/kg improved the efficacy to 95.6&#x0025;, while the combination of TC and AQ at a dose of 12.5 &#x002B; 10 mg/kg resulted in 81.9&#x0025; efficacy. The combination of TC and CF at a dose of 12.5 &#x002B; 10 mg/kg resulted in a 94.4&#x0025; inhibition in the parasitemia level at day 8 p.i. <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>)</bold>. The potentiation of TC that was achieved in <italic>in vivo</italic> combination therapy confirms the result that was observed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> combination experiment, emphasizing that chalcones are good combinatorial drugs. With regard to the chemotherapeutic effects of TC against <italic>Leishmania</italic> in mice, Pi&#x00F1;ero et al. (2006) showed that a single dose of 4 mg/kg TC by subcutaneous administration could completely inhibit the pathogenicity of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In addition to being efficacious, chalcones enhanced the production of nitric oxide, which kills the intra-erythrocytic parasites and stimulates the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to confirm the ability of TC to eliminate <italic>B. microti</italic>, a PCR assay was performed on samples collected on day 45 p.i. to be analyzed for the presence of DNA. Interestingly, this study confirmed the absence of <italic>B. microti</italic> DNA in groups treated with a combination chemotherapy of TC&#x002B;DA or TC&#x002B;CF <bold>(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>)</bold> as compared to monotreatment. These results underscore the importance of combination chemotherapy in the effective control of piroplasmosis. This finding further emphasizes the need for combination therapy to achieve the most optimum efficacy and prevent the relapse of infection or development of a carrier state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, TC did not show toxic side effects to mice <bold>(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A-C</xref>)</bold>, consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Taken together, the findings advocate that TC is a potential drug against bovine and equine piroplasmosis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>CH and TC showed growth inhibitory and against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria in vitro.</italic> Furthermore, TC showed chemotherapeutic efficacies against <italic>B. microti in vivo</italic>. TC effectiveness <italic>in vivo</italic> was comparable to that shown by DA, and it showed no toxicity to mice. The TC&#x2013;DA and TC&#x2013;CF combinations showed higher efficiency against piroplasms than did TC, DA, or CF monotherapies. This implies that TC could be used as a chemotherapeutic drug against piroplasmosis. Moreover, the results suggest that the TC&#x2013;DA and TC&#x2013;CF combination chemotherapies will be better choices for the treatment of piroplasmosis than TC, DA, or CF monotherapies.</p>
