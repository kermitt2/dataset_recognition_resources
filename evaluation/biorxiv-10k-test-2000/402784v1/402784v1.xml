<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Puberty onset is a complex trait regulated by multiple genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we narrowed a puberty related QTL down to a 1.7 Mb region on chromosome X in female mice and inferred miR-505-3p as the functional gene.</p>
<p>We conducted ectopic expression of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female mice through lentivirus-mediated orthotopic injection. The impact of miR-505-3p on female puberty was evaluated by the measurement of pubertal events and histological analysis. The results showed that female mice with overexpression of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus manifested later puberty onset timing both in vaginal opening and ovary maturation, followed by weaker fertility lying in the longer interval time between mating and delivery, higher abortion rate and smaller litter size. We also constructed miR-505-3p knockout mice by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. MiR-505-3p knockout female mice showed earlier vaginal opening timing, higher serum gonadotrophin and higher expression of puberty-related gene, as well as its target gene <italic>Srsf1</italic> in the hypothalamus than their wild type littermates.</p>
<p><italic>Srsf1</italic> was proved to be the target gene of miR-505-3p that played the major role in this process. The results of RIP-seq (RNA Immunoprecipitation-sequencing) showed that SF2, the protein product of <italic>Srsf1</italic> gene, mainly bound to ribosome protein (RP) mRNAs in GT1-7 cells. The collective evidence implied that miR-505-3p/SRSF1/RP could play a role in the sexual maturation regulation of mammals.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The puberty onset in mammals is a vital biological process that signals the acquisition of reproductive capacity. The initiation of puberty is triggered by the activation of hypothalamic pulsatile GnRH surge. The dysregulation of pubertal development shows relevance to later health risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and other health disorders. Recent progress indicates that a lot of genes play a role in the excitatory or inhibitory regulation of GnRH release. However, the detailed pathway of pubertal timing remains unclear. Our previous studies isolated an X-linked QTL that was associated with the timing of puberty in mice. In this study, we proved that miR-505-3p was a female puberty onset regulator based on data from positional cloning, ectopic expression and knockout mouse models. We also assigned <italic>Srsf1</italic> as the functional target gene of miR-505-3p underlying this process. The results of RIP-seq showed that SF2, the protein of <italic>Srsf1</italic> gene, preferential bound to ribosome protein (RP) mRNAs in GT1-7 cells. We propose that miR-505-3p/SF2/RP could play a role in the sexual maturation regulation of mammals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Puberty onset is an essential and complicated physiology process that relies on the activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis(HPGA).The pulsatile secretion of GnRH hormones from the specialized neurons in the hypothalamus trigger gonadal hormones secreting cascade that results in the maturation of sexual behaviors and signal the transition from non-reproductive juvenile into a fertility competent adult [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The dysregulation of pubertal development shows relevance to later health risks for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and other health disorders [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The genetic and environmental factors involved in the regulation of puberty timing have been well characterized. The mutations in Gpr54 (a G protein&#x2013;coupled receptor) gene could cause autosomal recessive idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (iHH) in human, and the puberty regulating function of GPR54 was also revealed in mice with complementary genetic approaches [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which suggested a crucial role of GPR54 and its ligand Kisspeptin in the regulation of puberty. During the last decade, novel central neuroendocrine pathways in the control of puberty have been revealed. In 2017, genome-wide association studies including genotype data of up to &#x223C;370,000 women identified 389 independent signals for age at menarche, &#x223C;250 genes were implicated via coding variation or associated expression[<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].The maternal imprinted gene MKRN3 was the first gene identified with an inhibitory effect on GnRH secretion. It was related with central precocious puberty by whole-exome sequencing of pedigree samples [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. System biology strategies revealed that at least three gene networks might contribute to the puberty onset [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>In our previous studies, we isolated a QTL (quantitative trait locus) on Chromosome X affecting the vaginal opening in female mice [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, We narrowed the QTL down to a 1.7Mb region by constructing 8 interval-specific congenic strains (ISCSs) between C57/BL6 (B6) and C3H/He(C3H) mice. Among the genes in this region, miR-505-3p was assumed to be the potential candidate according to the variation in its flanking sequence and gene expression levels between C3H and B6 mice, as well as its functional annotation. MicroRNAs are endogenous, small non-coding RNAs (&#x223C;22nt in length) silencing the gene expression at post-transcriptional level by targeting the 3&#x2019; untranslated region (UTRs) of mRNAs. MicroRNAs get involved in various biological processes [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent evidence suggested that microRNAs also participated in the precise regulation of puberty onset [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MiR-505-3p usually serves as a biomarker of various diseases including primary biliary cirrhosis, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Zucchi et al detected the downregulation of miR-505-3p in newborn rat brain in response to the prenatal stress [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, miR-505-3p was proved to induce apoptosis in MCF7-ADR cells, and functioned as a tumor suppressive miRNA [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], its first validated target by experiments was the alternative splicing factor/splicing factor2 (ASF/SF2 or SRSF1) [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is a regulator of mTOR (the mammalian Target of Rapamycin) pathway [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while the activated mTOR signaling could accelerate the vaginal opening in female rats [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such indirect evidence tempted us to clarify the authentic relationship between miR-505-3p and the mammalian puberty onset regulation.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted overexpression of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female mice through lentivirus-mediated orthotopic injection. We also constructed miR-505-3p knockout mice (miR-505-3p -/-) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The impact of miR-505-3p on the female puberty was evaluated by the measurement of pubertal events and histological analysis in these genetically modified mice. The results showed that female mice with ectopic expression of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus manifested later puberty onset timing, compromised fertility, higher abortion rate and smaller litter size. While miR-505 knockout female mice showed lightly earlier vaginal opening and shorter interval time between mating and delivery. <italic>Srsf1</italic> was proved to be the target gene of miR-505-3p that played the major role in this process. The results of RNA Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (RIP-Seq) showed SF2, the protein of <italic>Srsf1</italic> gene, mainly bound ribosome protein (RP) mRNAs in GT1-7 cells.</p>
<p>All these results suggest that miR-505-3p may regulate the puberty onset via modulating the expression of <italic>Srsf1</italic> gene and RP. They give us insights into a new regulating pathway involving microRNA, SF2 and ribosome proteins in mammalian puberty onset.</p>

<title>MiR-505-3p was identified as a functional candidate gene in the QTL on chromosome X</title>
<p>We have identified a 9.5Mb (2.5cM) QTL that regulates the puberty onset of female mice on chromosome X in our previous work. To narrow down the QTL further, 8 interval-specific congenic strains (ISCSs) with intervals within this region of B6 chromosome X were substituted into C3H background in the N7 generation, in which we recorded the age at VO and body weights of all female mice. Nonparametric tests showed that strain# 1&#x223C;3, 7 and 8 showed significantly different VO age from the parental strain C3H, while strain #4&#x223C;6 didn&#x2019;t. Based on the QTL information and allele distribution among those strains, we ascertained a shrunk QTL of about 1.6Mb between rs13483770 and rs299055848 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, S1 Table).</p>

<p>There are 19 genes in the QTL region (rs13483770&#x223C;rs299055848) on chromosome X, including seven pseudogenes, four ncRNAs, seven protein-coding genes, and one microRNA gene. To screen for the candidate gene(s), we referred to Sanger database to search for the DNA sequence variations between C3H and B6 mice in this region. Data showed that there were no SNPs, short indels or structural variants lying in the coding region, 5&#x2019; or 3&#x2019; UTR of these genes except for mir-505, as sensible variations of 5 consecutive SNPs existed near 5&#x2019; upstream region of mir-505 gene (S2 Table). To confirm the results from Sanger database, we did DNA sequencing for the interested regions of the 19 genes, and found no exceptions. We compared the mRNA expression levels of the seven protein-coding genes in HPG axis between B6 and C3H female mice in order to find out the differentially expressed genes. Six of them were expressed in mouse HPGA except for the gene of Gm7073, but they made hardly significant differences in the amount of accumulation between the two strains, especially at the hypothalamus or pituitary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). On the other hand, miR-505-3p of B6 was expressed higher in the hypothalamus than that of C3H (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) at postnatal 15 days, and lower in the pituitary and ovary at postnatal 45 days. We investigated the temporal and spatial expression pattern of miR-505-3p in B6 female mice, and found that mir-505-3p was most abundant at hypothalamus in the four tested tissues including pituitary, ovary and muscles (Fig1D); it reached its peak value of expression at neonatal period (PD5) and decreased gradually afterwards (Fig1E), which implied its inhibiting role in the sexual maturation process. The integrated evidence suggested that miR-505-3p deserved further investigation as a functional candidate gene.</p>
<p>We constructed a GT1-7 cell line with stable overexpression of miR-505-3p named pGT1-7. In pGT1-7 cells, the expression level of miR-505-3p increased by 1500 times than the GT1-7 cells(S1 Fig). We compared the expression profiling between pGT1-7 and negative control group GT1-7 (transfected with pLenti6.3-nc lentivirus) on DNA microarray, and found that some important puberty related genes, including <italic>Kiss1</italic> and <italic>GnRH</italic>, decreased in pGT1-7 cells. These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR assay (Fig1F), implying that miR-505-3p may participated in the puberty onset regulation through the inhibition of puberty related genes.</p>

<title>Ectopic expression of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus influences the puberty onset timing and fertility of female mice</title>
<p>In order to investigate the influence of miR-505-3p on the puberty timing in female mice, we made miR-505-3p overexpressed in the hypothalamus of C57BL/6 (B6) female mice at postnatal 15 days by lentivirus-mediated orthotopic injection. In the window of post injection 5 to 40 days, the hypothalamic miR-505-3p overexpression maintained at a high level, reaching the peak at 10 days after injection (miR-505-3p-LV-treated=24.89&#x00B1;3.319, saline-treated=1.016&#x00B1;0.08129, untreated=1.096&#x00B1;0.2130, P&#x003C;0.0001). (S2 Fig)</p>
<p>After injection, the mice were weighted once every other day, and the miR-505-3p-LV-treated (abbreviated as LV-treated) female mice showed significant growth retardation compared with the untreated ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The vaginal opening in untreated mice were 2 days earlier than the LV-treated ones (P&#x003C;0.01) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>After sexual maturation, the female mice were mated with wild-type experienced male mice to evaluate the long-term impact of hypothalamic miR-505-3p overexpression on reproduction. The LV-treated female mice needed more time to procreate and had smaller newborn litters compared with the control ones, the death rate of offspring before weaning increased in LV-treated mice as well (Figure2C and 2D). The Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained ovarian sections at various time showed the delay of the formation of the preovulatory follicles and corpora luteas (CLs) in LV-treated female mice compared with untreated ones, which provided explanation for the later birth of newborn offspring in LV-treated mice, and the reduced number of newborn offsprings could be attributed to the deficiency or reduced number of preovulatory follicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>We found higher death rate of litters in LV-treated groups, and the rate of abortion in LV-treated groups was 2.5 -fold higher than the two control groups. About 8 percent of LV-treated mice were sterile in contrast with the control groups, in which no sterile mice were found (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The FISH (florescence in situ hybridization) results of the brain section showed that the sterile female mouse had stronger fluorescence signals near the third ventricle than the signals of its counterparts which had four or eight litters, respectively. This finding suggested the level and the location of miR-505-3p overexpression in the hypothalamus may influence the fertility phenotype of female mice(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>With the help of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we obtained 41 living offsprings, and 16 of them carried mutations in mir-505 cDNA region on their genome detected by DNA sequencing. Two pups with the largest deletion (-17bp and -23bp, respectively) adjacent to the 5&#x2019; end of miR-505 (S3 Fig) and in the coding region of mature miR-505-5p were kept as founders to generate DKO miR-505-3p -/-), SKO miR-505-3p &#x002B;/-) and wild type mice for puberty onset trait investigation by backcrossing to B6 mice. In DKO mice, the expressing level of miR-505-3p could hardly be tested, while in SKO mice, the expressing level of miR-505-3p decreased by approximate half (S4 Fig).

<p>We performed the Gene ontology analysis on the gene expression profilings data from the microarray detection between pGT1-7 and GT1-7 cells. 1490 genes were upregulated and 604 genes were downregulated in the pGT1-7 cells. Among these genes, we screened for the miR-505-3p target genes on the TargetScan website. Four predicted genes, including <italic>CD97</italic>,<italic>Hmbg1,Cadm1</italic> and <italic>Srsf1</italic> with high expression level in GT1-7 cells were assumed as the candidate target of miR-505-3p.

Given that SF2 was proved to be a regulator of mTOR signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylated status of S6K in pGT1-7 cells, but the amount of p-S6K made no difference between GT1-7 and pGT1-7 cells (S5 Fig C).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genetic strategies, such as positional cloning and association study, can be powerful tools to reveal the functional genes underlying the complex traits [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We took the advantage of mouse models to make interval-specific congenic strains (ISCS) between C3H/He and C57/BL6 mice to finemap the QTLs related to the puberty onset and then reveal the candidate gene according to the sequence variation, expression differentiation and functional connection. To our knowledge, miR-505-3p is the first microRNA which was found by positional cloning as a puberty regulator in female mice.</p>
<p>Considerable progress has been made to decipher the molecular foundation of the pubertal timing [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Especially some studies revealed the potential epigenetic regulatory role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in female puberty[<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Okabe et al indicate that the knockout of miR-200b and miR-429 can induce reduced fertility in female mice<sup>[<sup>28</sup>]</sup>.Zhu et al show the variation in Lin28/let7 pathway can change the body size and onset of puberty in mice[<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-132, miR--9 and miR-145 are also involved in the pubertal timing owing to their potential regulatory role of c-myc and Lin28<sup>[<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. In 2016, Messina et al. reported a microRNA switch that controled the rise of hypothalamus GnRH production before puberty in mice [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. They provided direct evidence that the increasing expression of miR-200/429 and miR-155 in GnRH neurons during the infantile period lifted the repressive control of GnRH expression, by repressing ZEB1 and CEBPB, respectively [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These results suggested the existence of a multilayered and interconnected array of miRNAs and their target genes that control the puberty timing. Our results shows the overexpression of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus can cause the delay of puberty timing and reduced fertility in female mice, and the results from miR-505-3p knockout mice supported the deduction, which could be a new member of this regulating array.</p>
<p>We constructed a miR-505-3p ectopic expression female mouse model by lentiviral delivery. Lentiviral vector as a versatile tool has been accessible to transfect post-mitotic neurons and induces substantial, long-term transgene expression<sup>[<sup>33</sup>-<sup>35</sup>]</sup>. In our experiment, the miR-505-3p overexpression in the mouse hypothalamus directed by lentivirus reached the peak (about 25 times as the control) on the tenth day after injection and continued for at least 40 days (though declined to 8 times of the control), which provided an ideal window to investigate the puberty onset and reproductive actions of the female mice affected by the microRNA. Besides reverse transcription and real-time PCR, we performed in situ hybridization for miR-505 detection using improved LNA-probes with high specificity and sensitivity. The expression pattern of hypothalamic miR-505-3p detected by in situ hybridization can be used to further elucidate the relationship between miR-505-3p function and the location of miR-505-3p in the hypothalamus. Actually we have observed some connections between the injecting site and the phenotypic distinction.</p>
<p>Finding out the target gene of miR-505-3p underlying the puberty onset in female mice can help to tell the regulation mechanism of this complex trait. In our previous work, we identified one of the important functions of miR-505-3p as that it was a crucial regulator for axonal elongation and branching through modulating autophagy in neurons [<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Atg12 was testified to be the key target gene of miR-505-3p in this process, as its protein product ATG12 (autophagy-related 12) was an essential component of the autophagy machinery during the initiation and expansion steps of autophagosome formation. However, we did not find the influence of miR-505-3p overexpression on the amount of ATG12 in GT1-7 cells, either in the mRNA expression profiling data or qRT-PCR detection, which could be due to the different cell types we used. Autophagy is more active in neurons than in cultured cells [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the autophagy-related proteins in neurons could be not as sensitive to the microRNA modulation as in the cultured GT1-7 cells. We found that when cultured in serum reduced medium, the target gene of miR-505-3p became more sensitive to microRNA regulation in GT1-7 cells [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which implied that the decreased velocity of the protein synthesis under malnourished condition can help the fine tuning of microRNAs on their targets. <italic>Srsf1</italic> is the first experimentally validated target gene of miR-505-3p, and it was also a regulator of mTOR pathway, which was reported to participate in the VO modulation in rats [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in miR-505-3p overexpressing pGT1-7 cells, the amount of the marker of the activated mTOR signaling phosphorylated S6K was not affected, which implied that the inhibition of the <italic>Srsf1</italic> expression by miR-505-3p did not influence the mTOR signaling in GT1-7 cells.</p>
<p><italic>Srsf1</italic> is the archetype member of the SR (Serine an Argenine rich protein) family of splicing regulators and has multiple functions in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, <italic>Srsf1</italic> is also a proto-oncogene in cell malignant transformation [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. SF2 could bind to ribosomal proteins and help in mRNA stability, transport, intracellular localization, and translation [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Ribosomal proteins play independent key roles in the regulation of apoptosis, multidrug resistance and carcinogenesis [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], RPL22 can inhibit Lin28B, RPS7 regulates PI3K/AKT and MAPK [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our RIP results showed that SF2 bind to the mRNA of ribosomal proteins preferentially which had not been reported before. The biological significance of this selectivity has not been clarified though, it encourages us to assume that miR-505-3p may affect the independent roles of ribosomal proteins by inhibiting SF2 in GT1-7 cells, and the output of these series effects is the downregulation of puberty related genes. The potential relationship between RP and the puberty development needs further elucidation. The function of miR-505-3p as a puberty regulator in female mice has been revealed by cell and animal model, but the underling mechanism still requires further researches.</p>

<p>In our previous work, a significant puberty-related ChrX QTL of 2.5 cM was found by genome scanning, in a panel of 10 modified interval-specific congenic strains (mISCSs) in C57/BL6 and C3H/He mice [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, the mice of the strain carrying the QTL were backcrossed with C3H mice. The resulting male F2 mice holding at least one recombination at the special interval were chosen and then backcrossed with female C3H to obtain N2 generation. The female N2 continued to mate with male C3H to generate N3 generation. N3 male mice holding only one recombination at the target interval were selected and continued to backcross with female C3H to generate N4. N4 mice siblings were crossed until N7 generation. At last, the age at VO of all female mice of N7 progenies was recorded. All modified ISCSs were verified by genotyping for the genetic markers on chromosome X. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Donghua University, and all experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>
