While methods for assaying spatial expression profiles are increasingly accessible, there is a lack of computational approaches that allow for studying the relevance of the spatial organization of tissues on cell-cell heterogeneity.

SVCA estimates <italic>signatures of spatial variance components</italic>, thereby quantifying the effect of cell-cell interactions, as well as environmental and intrinsic cell features on the expression levels of individual molecules. In application to a breast cancer Imaging Mass Cytometry dataset, our model yields robust spatial variance signatures, identifying cell-cell interactions as a major driver of expression heterogeneity. We also apply SVCA to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, where we identify molecular pathways that are linked to cell-cell interactions.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Experimental advances have enabled assaying RNA and protein abundances of single cells in spatial contexts, thereby allowing to study single cell variation in tissues. Already, these technologies have delivered new insights into tissue systems and the sources of transcriptional variation (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Battich, Stoeger, &#x0026; Pelkmans, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Bodenmiller, 2016</xref>), with potential use as biomarkers for human health (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Bodenmiller, 2016</xref>). Spatial expression variation can reflect interactions between adjacent cells, or can be caused by cells that migrate to specific locations in a tissue to perform their functions (e.g. immune cells).</p>
<p>Different technologies allow for assaying spatially resolved expression profiles. Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Giesen et al., 2014</xref>) and Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Angelo et al., 2014</xref>) rely on protein labeling with antibodies coupled with metal isotopes of specific masses followed by high-resolution tissue ablation and ionisation. IMC enables profiling of over 40 targeted proteins with subcellular resolution. Other methods such as MxIF and CycIF use immunofluorescence for protein quantification of tens of markers at a time (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Gerdes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Lin, Fallahi-Sichani, &#x0026; Sorger, 2015</xref>). Increasingly, there also exist optical imaging-based assays to measure single cell RNA levels. Mer-FISH and seq-FISH use a combinatorial approach of fluorescence-labeled small RNA probes to identify and localise single RNA molecules (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Boettiger, Moffitt, Wang, &#x0026; Zhuang, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Gerdes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Shah, Lubeck, Zhou, &#x0026; Cai, 2017</xref>)), which allows for measuring larger numbers of readouts (currently between 140 and 250). In addition, there exist other spatial expression profiling techniques such as Spatial Transcriptomics (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">St&#x00E5;hl et al., 2016</xref>), which currently however do not offer single cell resolution and are therefore not adequate to study cell-to-cell variation.</p>
<p>The availability of spatially resolved expression data represents an unprecedented opportunity to disentangle largely unexplored sources of single cell variations: i) intrinsic sources of variation due to difference in cell types or states (e.g. cell-cycle state), ii) environmental effects from the cell microenvironment and iii) interactions between adjacent cells. Yet, although experimentally spatial omics profiles can be generated with increasingly high throughput, the required computational strategies for interpreting the resulting data are only beginning to emerge. On the one hand, there exist methods for spatial clustering based on single cell expression profiles (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Achim et al., 2015</xref>), and to assess the overall relevance of the spatial topology on gene expression (Svensson, Teichmann, &#x0026; Stegle, n.d.). However, these methods do not allow for directly assessing cell-cell interactions. On the other hand, methods exist that can capture cell-cell interactions based on manual cell-type assignments and predefined cellular neighbourhoods (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Goltsev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Schapiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2015</xref>). While these methods have already identified qualitative insights into the interaction of cell types, they do not allow for quantifying the impact of spatial effects on individual genes or proteins.</p>
<p>Here, we present <italic>Spatial variance component analysis (SVCA),</italic> a computational framework to model spatial sources of variation of individual genes or proteins. SVCA allows for decomposing the sources of variation into intrinsic effects, environmental effects and cell-cell interactions. The model is parameterized based on continuous expression profiles, and in particular avoids the need to define discrete cell types. We illustrate SVCA using data from multiple technologies and biological domains, including IMC proteomics profiles data from human cancer tissue and spatial single-cell profiles from the mouse hippocampus based on seqFISH. Across these applications, we find pronounced effects due to cell-cell interactions, and we identify biologically relevant genes and pathways that participate in these processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>SVCA considers random effect components that capture i) <italic>intrinsic</italic> sources of variation due to differences in cell types or states, ii) <italic>environmental</italic> sources of variation due to local extracellular factors iii) source of variations due to <italic>cell-cell interactions</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The effect of these factors on molecular expression variability is modelled using a random effect model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Importantly, SVCA does not require assigning cells to discrete cell types, but instead is based on a continuous measure of cell-cell similarities estimated from the covariance of their expression profiles (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). Our random effect model also circumvents the need to define discrete neighbours but instead weights interactions between pairs of cells as a function of their distance (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). The fitted SVCA model provides a decomposition of these sources of variation of individual genes and proteins, and the model can be used to assess the significance of these respective components. The resulting spatial variance signatures provides a compact summary of the drivers of expression variation in a dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Spatial variance component analysis (SVCA): approach and overview.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SVCA allows for decomposing the variability of individual genes and proteins into i) cell intrinsic effects (due to differences in intrinsic cell type or state, blue), ii) general environmental effects that capture expression differences due to local extracellular factors (green) and iii) a cell-cell interaction component that captures differences in expression level attributable to different cellular composition of a cell&#x2019;s neighbourhood (yellow). (<bold>b</bold>) SVCA is based on a random effect framework, considering additive contributions of these different components (<bold>Methods</bold>).

<p>Initially, we used simulated data to assess the statistical calibration and the accuracy of SVCA variance estimates. Briefly, we generated expression profiles by sampling from the model, using empirical parameters derived from 11 real datasets (<bold>Methods</bold>), including the position of cells and the cell state covariance. First, we simulated expression profiles assuming no interaction effects to assess the calibration of the corresponding test, finding that the model yields conservative estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We also assessed the detection power of the interaction test when simulating cell-cell interactions that explain increasing proportions of the gene expression variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and when varying the number of cells in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, we compared the estimated variance components for cell-cell interactions with the simulated variance components, again observing that the model estimates are conservative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SVCA can be used to estimate and test for spatial drivers of single cell variability, in particular cell-cell interactions.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Application of SVCA to spatial proteomics data of breast cancer tissues</title>
<p>Next, we applied SVCA to a recent Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) dataset from human breast cancers, consisting of 52 breast biopsies from 27 breast cancer patients with variable disease grade and from different cancer subtypes, sampled from different tumour locations (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Schapiro et al., 2017</xref>). SVCA revealed substantial differences of cell-cell interaction component across proteins, explaining up to half of the expression variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3a</xref>). Immune cell markers were enriched among the set of proteins with the strongest cell-cell interaction effects: CD44, CD20, CD3 and CD68 had significant cell-cell interaction components in 35, 34, 34 and 38 out of the 52 images respectively (FDR&#x3C;1&#x0025;, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We used bootstrapping to confirm the robustness of the variance estimates (<bold>Fig. S5</bold>), and we observed that a variance component model that accounts for cell-cell interactions was able to more accurately impute gene expression profiles than models that ignore such effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>, Fig. S2).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="265256_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We also observed substantial variations in the spatial variance signatures between individual images (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>), motivating investigating the relationship between these differences and clinical covariates, including tumour grade, ER status, PR status, HER2 status. Using Principal Component Analysis, we identified tumour grade as the most important explanatory variable for differences in spatial variance components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3c</xref>), followed by ER status and PR status (<bold>Fig. S8</bold>). Inspection of the PCA loadings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>) identified the cell-cell interaction component and the environmental component for a subset of proteins (including PR and CD44) as the most informative SVCA feature affected by tumour grade. This was also evident when comparing environmental and cell-cell interaction effects across tumours of different grades (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>), showing a relative increase in the cell-cell interaction component in higher grade tumours. This effect could in part be due to the increased cell density in later stage tumours.</p>

<sec id="s2b"><title>RNA-based datasets based on imaging technologies</title>
<p>SVCA can be used for the analysis of data from a broad range of spatially resolved technology, including imaging-based assays. To explore this, we considered a mouse hippocampus datasets, profiling 240 RNA expression levels in 21 distinct brain regions of a single animal, using seqFISH (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2017</xref>). Leveraging the high-dimensionality of the data, we sought to identify individual genes and pathways that are most linked to cell-cell interactions.</p>
<p>Similarly to the IMC dataset, SVCA signatures were robust and could accurately predict gene expression levels out of sample (<bold>Fig S17</bold>, <bold>S18</bold>, <bold>S19</bold>). After averaging SVCA signatures across images, we used the reactome database (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Croft et al., 2014</xref>) to identify pathways that were enriched among genes with large cell-cell interaction components (<bold>Methods</bold>). 5 pathways showed a significant enrichment, with <italic>transmission across chemical synapses, neurotransmitter release cycle</italic> and <italic>neuronal system</italic> among the ones with highest significance (FDR&#x3C;5&#x0025;, considering 60 reactome pathways with three or more genes contained in this dataset, <bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>). For comparison, we also considered gene set enrichment based on the average expression level of genes across images, which identified distinct GO categories <italic>(transmembrane transport</italic> and <italic>SLC-mediated transmembrane transport),</italic> with only little overlap to the pathways identified from the cell-cell interactions.</p>
<p>This demonstrates the complementarity of spatial and abundance-based signatures for studying biological activity in tissues, as only the former accounts for the spatial structure of the cells&#x2019; native environment.</p>
<p>Similarly to results obtained on the IMC datasets, spatial variance signatures were variable across images, which is consistent with the high biological variability between the different regions of the hippocampus imaged here reported in (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2017</xref>). Principal components of the global spatial variance signature for the dorsal region clustered together, irrespective of their CA1/CA3 location. Similarly, images from the Dentate Gyrus (DG) also clustered together, and there was some proximity between signatures from the ventral region, although with more variation between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>,e). This is consistent with Shah et al&#x2019;s observation that the ventral and dorsal regions of the CA1 and the CA3 mirrored each other with respect to their cellular compositions, and that ventral regions are much more heterogeneous in their cellular composition. Spatial Variance signatures for intermediate regions, however, did not show much resemblance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d,f</xref>).</p>

<p>We also applied SVCA to a breast cancer cell culture dataset profiled using the mer-FISH technique (140 RNA expression levels) (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt et al., 2016</xref>). The large spatial domain and the number of cells imaged from a biological homogenous cell culture system means that multiple field of views can be defined as technical replicates. Consistent with this, the variance components of SVCA were highly consistent across images (<bold>Fig. S10</bold>, <bold>Fig. S11</bold>, <bold>Fig. S12</bold>, <bold>Fig. S14</bold>), with average coefficients of variation for cell-cell interactions of 20-40&#x0025;, compared to typically 75-150&#x0025; (<bold>Fig. S13</bold>) for the IMC and seq-fish data (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>, <bold>Fig. S20</bold>). These results further support the general applicability of the model to data from different technology and the robustness of SVCA variance signatures.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We presented Spatial Variance Component Analysis (SVCA), a framework for the analysis of spatially resolved molecular expression data. Our model computes a spatial variance signature for individual mRNA or protein levels, decomposing their sources of variation into spatial and non-spatial components. Most prominently, SVCA provides a quantitative assessment of the effect of cell-cell interactions on the expression profile of individual molecules. The model avoids the definition of cell types and neighbourhoods, instead using continuous measure of cell state and euclidean distances between cells.</p>
<p>We have applied SVCA to multiple datasets that were generated using alternative technologies, probing either RNA transcripts or proteins, thereby demonstrating the broad applicability of the model. Across these applications, we observed that cell-cell interactions substantially contributed to gene expression variation, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Battich, Stoeger, &#x0026; Pelkmans, 2015</xref>) and supports the concept that studying single cell expression in the native context is important to understanding the sources of these variations. We also showed that the variability of spatial variance signatures across samples of the same biological system could be linked to different clinical contexts or to the internal structure of a given organ, which underlines the biological relevance of these signatures. Finally, using higher dimensionality data obtained from optical technologies, we found that genes with largest cell-cell interaction components were enriched in specific pathways, suggesting that spatial variance signatures could help us understanding biological activity in tissue. These results suggest that analysing single cell data in their native context, with SVCA or related methods, will help us understand how the spatial organisation of tissues impact single cell biology.</p>
<p>Although we have tested the calibration and robustness of SVCA, the model is not free of limitations. At present, the model does not account for technology specific noise and instead assumes Gaussian distributed residuals, thus requiring suitable processing of the raw data such that these assumptions are sufficiently met (See <bold>Methods</bold>). Further development could consider generalized LMMs, for example to couple the random effect component with a negative-binomial likelihood. A second limitation of SVCA is that the model is univariate, which means that individual genes or proteins are modelled independently from each other. A multivariate model could account for relationships between genes involved in the same pathways, either in an unsupervised manner or using prior knowledge (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Buettner, Pratanwanich, McCarthy, Marioni, &#x0026; Stegle, 2017</xref>). Such approaches could give a more comprehensive understanding of how biological processes are affected by tissue structure.</p>
<p>There is a growing appreciation of the role of spatial distribution of proteins, transcripts and other molecules in determining tissues functioning and its deregulation in disease, with potential value as predictors of clinical outcomes. This is largely driven by vigorous development of novel technologies that enable us to capture such data (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Aichler &#x0026; Walch, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Bodenmiller, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Goltsev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>). We believe that the SVCA framework and extensions thereof will be of broad use to analyze this burgeoning spatially-resolved molecular data to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple diseases.</p>
