<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling during the whole life. By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years.</p>
<p>Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained.</p>
<p>To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy.</p>
<p>In this work we propose a minimal model of BMU function which involves a small number of signals and accounts for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions are i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a reduced choice of decisions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) such decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor is coupled to that of a few external mediators. It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Our skeleton is a living organ that is being renewed throughout our life. This task is accomplished by teams of bone cells termed as Bone Multicellular Units (BMUs) that are recruited when and where needed, to operate at places where bone has lost functionality either for an excess of mechanical stress or because loss of activity. Once assembled, BMU remove old bone and replace it by new one, and disband as soon as their mission has been accomplished. No single bone evades BMU screening, so that the whole human skeleton is completely renewed approximately every ten years.</p>
<p>It is natural to wonder how such robust and fascinating process is regulated. Many signaling pathways involved in bone remodeling have been identified so far, but whether all of them are necessary for BMU operation remains unclear. In this work we show that just a reduced number of such signals could suffice for that purpose. This suggests that a large degree of redundancy might have been kept in place, perhaps as a consequence of different convergent strategies developed in the course of evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human skeleton is a complex structure made up of 206 bones, which provides a supporting framework for the body. It acts as a shield to protect internal organs and plays a crucial role in locomotion by mediating the force arising from muscle contraction. In spite of its inert appearance, bone is an extremely dynamic tissue that is continuously being remodelled to adapt to changing mechanical demands. Such remodeling, which is carried out at a microscopic scale, consists in the removal of low-performing bone and its replacement by new, fully functional one. This task is fulfilled by suitable agents called for that purpose, as described below.</p>
<p>Bone tissue is formed by a mineralized matrix that has been hardened to provide a supporting function. There are three key cell types that are responsible for matrix production, maintenance and remodeling: osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes which perform different homeostatic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Osteoclasts, recruited when needed from their cell precursors, are in charge of degrading dysfunctional bone, whereas synthesis of new bone to replace the former is carried out by osteoblasts. Osteocytes, the most abundant bone cells, form a three-dimensional interconnected network throughout the bones. They act as mechanosensors that monitor mechanical stress within bone tissues, and react to changes in both the amount and the direction of loading applied on bones.</p>
<p>A key event that triggers bone remodeling is osteocyte cell death (apoptosis) occurring over comparatively small length scales and resulting, for instance, from unusual mechanical load or from micro-fractures induced by physical exercise. Concerning the first situation, it should be mentioned that the relation between osteocyte apoptosis and load applied is known to be U-shaped. This means that mechanical stresses within a normal physiological range prevent it, whereas those above or below this range induce it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In traumatic bone fractures, a considerable amount of osteocytes are eliminated and alert signals are produced that recruit immune cells and result in an inflammatory response. In such case, an alternative mechanism of bone formation is triggered, where other cell types are implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We shall not deal with this case here, since we will be concerned with homeostatic bone remodeling at smaller scales. The manner in which such process occurs is now succinctly described.</p>
<p>Following osteocyte apoptosis in a microscopic region (termed as Bone Remodeling Compartment (BRC), which is often about 400 microns wide), organic teams called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU) are locally recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Each BMU consists of several morphologically and functionally different cell types, mainly osteocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, that act in coordination over the BRC to replace old bone by new one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Not all cell types required are initially at place. In fact, prior to remodeling a normal presence of osteocytes produces an inhibitory effect that keeps osteoblasts deactivated and prevents osteoclast precursors, which eventually will give raise to acting osteoclasts, from being called in. However, osteocytes apoptosis over the BRC results in a drop of such inhibitory action, which has several consequences. To begin with, it leads to osteoblasts activation and to the recruitment of osteoclasts precursors arising from the bone marrow. Such precursors subsequently differentiate into mature osteoclasts, which start the erosion (resorption) of adjacent bone, leading to the appearance of the so-called cutting cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In a later stage, activated osteoblasts, marching in the wake of bone-destroying cutting cones, will replenish the cavity left behind the latter by secreting an osteoid matrix, a precursor of new bone. Some of the active osteoblasts become trapped in the matrix that they secrete and eventually differentiate into osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], which in turn will be instrumental in the subsequent mineralization of the matrix surrounding them, thus concluding a local bone remodeling event. The whole process is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> below</p>

<p>A sketch of BMU operation after a group of osteocytes has undergone apoptosis near bone surface. Bone resorption by osteoclasts (red arrow) and bone formation by osteoblasts (green arrow) are spatially and temporally coupled. Bone remodeling is initiated when osteoclast precursor cells are recruited to the altered bone surface (black stellate cells) and fuse to form mature, bone resorbing osteoclasts (red cells) that attach to the surface. Mature osteoclasts degrade the mineralized matrix and produce resorption pits also called resorption bays or Howship&#x2019;s lacunae. Once osteoclasts have degraded the target area, they undergo apoptosis, and osteoblasts situated behind them first secrete osteoid matrix and subsequently differentiate into osteocytes</p>

<p>It should be stressed that the process just recalled is exquisitely regulated. It only takes place where needed and the amount of new bone generated exactly balances that of old bone destroyed, thus warranting that no net changes in bone mass nor mechanical stress remain after each remodeling cycle. Any imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation might lead to pathological disorders. For instance, five important human diseases: osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, Paget&#x2019;s disease, osteopetrosis and rickets are associated to malfunctions in bone remodeling.</p>
<p>To date, and in spite of substantial progress achieved during the last decades, the mechanisms of cell signaling that regulate BMU operation remain only partially understood. It is known that such regulation is of a local nature, since remodeling is simultaneously and independently occurring at different places, so that the whole adult skeleton is renewed approximately every ten years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The local nature of that process suggests that it should be a consequence of individual cell decisions that must be somehow coordinated at a population level. For instance, osteoblasts should not start secreting osteoid matrix before osteoclasts destruction task is finished. This raises at once the questions of how such coordination can be achieved, and what internal circuitry within a BMU keeps such unit operative when remodeling is needed, and shuts it off immediately afterwards. We shall address these issues in the following sections.</p>
<p>Specifically, in this work we propose and analyse a simple, space-dependent model that is able to reproduce BMU operation and requires only of a small number of signaling cues. In our model, BMU function is shown to result from a limited number of individual decisions (divide, die, migrate or differentiate) taken by any of the cells involved as a consequence of the coupled dynamics of external cues and internal decision inhibitors. Simplicity is a key goal here. We are in fact interested in describing a minimal software sufficient to ensure BMU operation and involving generic molecules able to elicit actions that have already been experimentally observed. We therefore not aim at providing a comprehensive model of bone remodeling where most (if not all) possibly involved pathways are retained. Rather, we are intent to identify the minimal circuitry needed to keep a BMU operative. We believe that this may be a useful complement to previous work (see for instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and references therein) where attention is paid to building models that include as many biological ingredients as possible. We hope that a combined use of both approaches (comprehensive and minimality-driven) could shed further light into our understanding of bone remodeling and on the control of this process when such action may be needed.</p>

<title>The role of molecular signaling in bone remodeling</title>
<p>To date, a considerable number of signals involved in BMU operation have been identified in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. For instance, sclerostin is secreted by normal osteocytes and is known to inhibit both osteoblast activation and osteoclast recruitment from precursor cells in the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. This inhibitory effect prevents the activation of BMUs in regions where bone remodeling is not needed. In fact, only when an appropriate number of osteocytes undergo apoptosis in a given area, due for instance to micro-fractures or changes in mechanical load, will the inhibitory effect of sclerostin be significantly depleted, thus entailing the activation of a BMU and the subsequent initiation of a bone remodeling event.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a set of signals known under the generic name of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) have been shown to play a key role during early stages of bone remodeling. Some members of this family, such as TGF-<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> and TGF-<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>, are known to foster differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. TGF-<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> can also induce migration of osteoblasts to the sites of bone formation during remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and inhibits osteoblast apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. TGF-<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> is mainly produced by osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], but it is also present in the bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and in platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This last factor, together with other signals such as HMGB-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] provides a link with inflammatory processes occurring at early stages of large fractures repair. Cytokines such as IGF-1, released from bone matrix, seem to play a similar role in activating osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and are necessary for their survival in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The next stage in the process of bone remodeling consists in the recruitment of osteoclasts. The main signals involved in this step are M-CSF and RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], that promote the differentiation of osteoclast precursors and the survival of activated osteoclasts. Since RANKL is mostly produced by activated osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], osteoclasts will only be recruited to sites were bone remodeling has already been triggered. Besides inhibiting osteoblast activation, sclerostin also induces apoptosis of active osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. It may thus act as a signal that stops bone resorption when the cutting edge has reached the required depth in each remodeling event. Finally, osteoid matrix production by active osteoblasts, as well as differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes seem to be cell-density dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and have been suggested to be mediated by connexin, a molecule that circulates through gap junction communications between osteoblasts, as well as by sclerostin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Finally, various chemoattractants/chemorepulsors that drive osteoclasts away from the region where their precursors are recruited have been described in the literature (see for instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]). We shall use one such generic signal as part of our algorithm below.</p>
<p>Concerning signaling effects, one also has to bear in mind that: I) different signals can have redundant effects; for example both TGF-<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> and IGF-1 induce osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], II) a given signal can have different effects on different cell types. For instance TGF-<italic>&#x03B2;</italic>, FGF and PDGF activate osteoblast and inhibit osteoclast action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and G-CSF is known to induce apoptosis and to inhibit differentiation in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and III) signals are not always provided by chemicals. In this context we have already remarked that osteocytes act as sensors that respond to changes in mechanical stress in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>The list just provided of molecular mediators and their effects on BMU cell types, which is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> below, is far from being complete. Moreover, knowing the identity of such mediators or describing their effects in qualitative terms is not enough to explain BMU operation during bone remodeling. In order to understand how a coherent collective plan of action emerges at a multicellular scale, quantitative aspects of the process need to be taken into account. Indeed, for any given set of signals involved, the amount of bone to be resorpted and produced in different remodeling events can be highly variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This implies in turn that the number and activity of cells recruited in a BMU should change to suit the needs at each particular remodeling process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Signal integration by individual cells. Inhibitory proteins</title>
<p>We now formulate our basic modeling assumptions, which can be summarized as follows. Cells within a BMU integrate signals in their immediate surroundings and the resultant determines a very limited set of actions, namely differentiation, cell division, migration and apoptosis. In addition, we propose that inhibitory proteins, blocking the progression of these actions within each cell type, mediate cell decisions in any bone-remodeling event.</p>
<p>To clarify this last assumption, it is worth recalling the well-known behavior of two inhibitory proteins, Rb and Bcl-2. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) arrests progression into the cell cycle, whereas the B-cell lymphome-2 protein (Bcl-2) precludes the initiation of the apoptosis program in most cell types, including osteocytes and other stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. More precisely, Rb binds to transcription factors of the E2F family, preventing the progression of the cell cycle to the synthesis stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. When the amount of active Rb falls below a critical threshold, a no-return point is reached (the Restriction Point of the cell cycle) that irreversibly leads to cell division. Analogously, Bcl-2 precludes the release of cytochrome c through the mitochondrial outer membrane, thus avoiding the initiation of the apoptosis program. If Bcl-2 is depleted beneath a suitable value, its inhibitory action is lost and the cell is committed to die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Hence a competition between inhibitory molecules results in a mechanism of cell fate control: the first of these inhibitors (Rb or Bcl-2) that falls below its corresponding threshold value determines the cell decision to divide or die and, importantly, the timing of such decision (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2.A</xref>). This mechanism also provides an explicit link between external signals and cell decisions, since membrane receptors are known to modulate the evolution of inhibitory molecules within the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. As a matter of fact, it has been recently shown that the interplay between receptor/signal interaction and the internal dynamics of Rb and Bcl-2 suffices to explain the onset of emergent population properties (as clonal expansion and contraction) in the case of immune response to acute infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="318931_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In our case, the occurrence of inhibitory proteins controlling cellular processes during bone remodeling is well documented in the literature. For instance, the roles of Rb, Bcl-2 and the transcription factor Runx2 have been described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] respectively. Moreover, different restriction points are known to occur for the various cell commitment alternatives involved in bone remodeling. In particular, the onset of two restriction points in the differentiation program of osteoblasts (marking respectively the transition to activated osteoblast and osteocyte types) has been pointed out in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The increased complexity derived from the presence of more than one cell type, together with the existence of several cell fates (division, apoptosis or alternative differentiation programs) introduces new possibilities with respect to the basic dichotomy cell division vs. cell death considered in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. However, the underlying logic can be extended to account for these new alternatives. For instance, several inhibitory molecules can simultaneously block the progression of alternative differentiation programs. In this case, the first inhibitor to reach its critical threshold will determine the fate of the cell (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2.B</xref>). We propose that cell choices thus determined are mutually exclusive. This seems to be the case for BMU cells. For instance, osteoblasts that start the differentiation program or decide to secrete osteoid matrix do not complete the cell cycle, and therefore do not proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. We also remark that this mechanism allows for one signal to trigger alternative cell decisions depending on its concentration.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the multiplicity of signals recalled in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, as well as the redundancy often observed in their functioning, we propose that the effective operation of a BMU can be modeled by means of a reduced version of the complex signaling network previously sketched. Specifically, we propose that three cell-released signals, denoted by R, S and T (with analogue roles to those of RANK, sclerostin and TBF-<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> respectively; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) plus one osteoclast cue (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]), that keeps such cells moving towards intact bone, acting on three types of internal inhibitors suffice for that purpose. The effect induced by such signals in the cell types involved is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>A model for BMU operation</title>
<p>We next describe the cell algorithms that constitute our proposed model. For simplicity, we will consider a two-dimensional cross section of bone adjacent to a section of bone marrow. The bone section considered will be thought of as a lattice with coordinates x, y, divided in boxes of equal size. Any such box can either remain empty or be occupied by only a single cell. On such region we will define a cellular automaton (CA) to describe the dynamics of the remodeling process. To that end, we will implement cellular algorithms based on the biological assumptions stated below. A first assumption is that progression within the cell cycle, apoptosis and the initiation of differentiation programs are initially blocked by specific inhibitory molecules as described above. This would allow for newly formed cells to remain in the first stage of the cell cycle (G1) before choosing a given cell fate. During this stage, membrane receptors interacting with external signals govern the dynamics of inhibitors, thus controlling the eventual decision of the cell. The effect of the complexes formed by membrane receptors and external cues in the inhibition (resp. activation) of any cell fate choice takes place through an increase (resp. decrease) in the amount of the inhibitory molecule controlling this choice. Cell fate is decided when the concentration of the first of the inhibitors considered attains its threshold value, that we set equal to zero for simplicity.</p>
<p>In our case, the inhibitor dynamics will be assumed to be of the following form:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">

<title>Osteoblasts (OBL)</title>
<p>Osteoblasts (OBL) are initially located at the interface between bone matrix and bone marrow. In normal conditions, osteoblasts homeostasis is maintained by a continuous cell turnover, involving both division and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. When a remodeling process starts, OBLs can choose among three alternative programs: division, apoptosis and differentiation into active osteoblasts (OBAs). We shall assume that OBL division an apoptosis just balance each other, and therefore focus on the third choice above. Activation is known to be mainly blocked by the release of sclerostin by osteocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This will be modeled by assuming that signal <italic>S</italic>, produced by osteocytes, increases the amount of a differentiation inhibitor in OBLs, denoted by <italic>d<sub>B</sub></italic>, according to the following dynamics:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">

During a bone remodeling process, osteoblasts remain in their original positions, delimiting the BRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Accordingly, OBLs do not move in our model. We recall that differentiation of a particular OBL is blocked while <italic>d<sub>B</sub> &#x003E;</italic> 0, and that the process of differentiation is triggered by the condition <italic>d<sub>B</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Active osteoblasts (OBA)</title>
<p>Once differentiated, OBLs become active osteoblasts (OBA). OBAs have three possible choices: cell division, cell death and differentiation into osteocytes (OCY). Cell division proceeds according to the following rules:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">

Cell division only occurs when the condition <italic>c</italic>(<italic>A</italic>) &#x003D; 0 is verified. Notice that, in our model, the movement of active osteoblasts front is just a consequence of cell division.</p>
<p>When OBAs are attached to the bone surface, cell division is no longer possible for lack of space. In that case OBAs secrete osteoid matrix; this last is represented by an order parameter <italic>b</italic>(<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>; <italic>t</italic>) which ranges from 0, corresponding to eroded bone, to value 1 for fully functional bone. Apoptosis, differentiation into OCY and osteoid production can take place, according to these equations:

<title>Osteoclast precursors (OCP)</title>
<p>OBA can recruit OCP to the bone remodeling zone by secreting signal <italic>R</italic>, while signal <italic>S</italic> inhibits OCP recruitment. For simplicity, we will not consider in the model OCP division and apoptosis, and assume instead that enough OCP are available in the bone marrow (in particular, in the locations adjacent to those occupied by OBAs). OCPs attach to the bone surface upon their recruitment by OBAs, after which they become active osteoclasts (OCL).

<title>Osteoclasts (OCL)</title>
<p>Once recruited to the BRC, OCPs become active osteoclasts (OCL) and start eroding the bone matrix, thus leading to the formation of a cutting cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. OCLs are assumed to be endowed with one apoptosis pathway controlled by signal <italic>S</italic>, produced by OCYs. This signal is instrumental in determining the depth that will be reached by the cutting cone. In particular, OCLs in locations with high concentrations of <italic>S</italic> will stop digging into the bone matrix and die. We will model the apoptosis pathway controlled by signal <italic>S</italic> by assuming that cell death is blocked by inhibitor <italic>a<sub>C</sub></italic>, whose dynamics is given by the

<p>We next describe the movement of osteoclasts during a bone remodeling event. We will assume that osteoclasts remove bone at a rate that depends on the amount of signal <italic>S</italic> and move to an adjacent box, along the normal to the ossification front, once they have removed bone in their current position.

<title>Signal diffusion and decay</title>
<p>The dynamics of signals in the CA is now described as follows. At any given time, they are produced by the corresponding cell types at constant rates. Signals are also assumed to undergo Arrhenius-type decay (meaning that their decay rate is proportional to their concentration). Signal transport through the bone matrix is conveniently represented as a diffusion process. We assume that such diffusion occurs faster that internal cell processes. In order to account for these two time scales simultaneously, we model diffusion by calculating, at each box and each iteration step of the model, a weighted average of the amount of signals in neighboring positions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4.A</xref>). Cells decisions are made upon comparing the amount of different signals in their adjacent boxes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we have proposed and analysed a minimal model for bone remodeling carried out by Bone Multicellular Units (BMUs) to replace old bone by new one, a process which is often triggered by changes in mechanical load. We have already recalled that such remodeling is continuously taking place during human life, so that on average the whole skeleton is renewed approximately every 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. BMUs activity is usually carried out on small regions, of about 4000 microns in width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], and therefore the total number of cells involved in each remodeling event is comparatively small. The previous length scale can also be used to characterize micro-fractures (arising for instance from physical exercise) which are also self-repaired in the same manner. BMUs operation can thus be viewed as the basic building block to keep homeostasis in bone tissue. When normal function in bone is compromised by large-scale hazards (say, fractures), more sophisticated repair mechanisms, involving in particular inflammatory signals, blood clot formation and the production of different callus templates for bone repair are involved. These mechanisms have not been discussed here.</p>
<p>Our goal in this work is to identify, by means of a mathematical model, a simple algorithm for BMU operation. To do this, we have kept to a few basic principles. First, at any time during that process, each cell within the different lineages present in a BMU should individually select one among a restricted set of actions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate. Such choice is not assumed to be random, but determined by feedback from the surrounding medium into the internal dynamics of molecules which act as decision inhibitors. No previous planning is presupposed, genetically or otherwise. Second, only a minimal number of signals are selected that allow for BMU functioning.</p>
<p>As recalled in a previous Section, molecular cues acting as those retained in our model have been already described. In particular, cell decision inhibitors have been identified, and effects induced by the signals retained have been shown to be caused by chemical mediators experimentally detected. However, we have not aimed at producing a comprehensive model where all data currently known could be fitted. We have instead attempted to show what the basic ingredients of an operational BMU could be like. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that some signals already identified are multi-functional (thus yielding different effects in different cell lines) and that in general some signaling networks observed can be redundant, perhaps as a consequence of having been arrived at through different paths in the course of evolution. Notice, however that we do not claim that our proposal is the only possible one. In principle, there could be alternative minimal models for what we have called a BMU software. We believe however, that the degree of complexity retained in our model could not be significantly reduced by alternative mechanisms.</p>
<p>Selecting a minimal model has the advantage of dealing with a comparatively small number of parameters. Concerning this last issue, we wish to emphasize that no parameter-fitting attempt has been made here. Our concern is to show that the model proposed has not only the potential to reproduce standard features in bone remodeling, but also to draw conclusions about the manner in which this process occurs that could not be a priori anticipated before simulating it. Accordingly, we will be content to select a set of coefficients for which such goals are achieved. Parameters appearing in the actual BMU software should be of a structural nature, and their precise values have to be experimentally determined. In fact, the circuitry underlying BMU operation is expected to be rather sensitive to small variations in such parameter values, a fact repeatedly observed in processes which have been arrived at in the course of evolution. An example of such situation is provided by the Krebs cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] which consists in a network of biochemical reactions taking place exactly at very precise rates and proportions. On the other hand, it is well known that a given phenomenon can be fitted by utterly different models, relying on different principles, upon appropriate choices of a suitable (and often rather modest) number of parameters appearing in them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We have shown herein that the parameters retained in our model can be selected so that BMU standard operation is reproduced and, importantly, consequences such as the dependence of osteoclasts lifespan on the size of the region to be repaired can be inferred that were not a priori clear before the model was simulated. We do not claim, however, that the results obtained provide a validation of the model. In our opinion, such validation could only stem from experimental determination of such values.</p>
<p>We conclude this discussion by briefly remarking on possible future directions arising from this work. To begin with, the experimental question of determining the operational parameters introduced in our model should be again stressed. If and when this is done, we would have in place a BMU chip structure to be used as a building block for operational purposes. On the other hand, one could simulate on models as that presented here the impact of external cues in the modulation of the repair process, either to slow it down or to accelerate it. Finally, as the size of the region to be repaired increases, a threshold should be reached beyond which inflammatory signals become relevant, and a new and more complex stage is entered. Understanding the matching between these two cases could be instrumental in designing techniques to foster bone fracture repair. We intend to pursue some of these subjects elsewhere.</p>

<title>Initialization</title>
<p>Simulations take place in a two-dimensional cellular automata (CA) of 150 &#x00D7; 250 boxes. 125 rows of this matrix are initially occupied by bone matrix and the rest by bone marrow. A row of OBL lies in the interface between them. OCYs are initially located at fixed, regularly spaced positions within the bone matrix. A random perturbation is then applied to their positions to avoid any potential effect of symmetries on the simulations of the model. At this point, OCYs and OBLs release signals that diffuse through the bone matrix until an equilibrium is attained. This equilibrium is determined by the balance between signal production and decay. Periodic boundary conditions are considered on both lateral sides of the region considered, and zero signal flux is imposed on the top and the bottom. A region of OCY apoptosis is randomly defined within <italic>a priori</italic> defined boundaries (<italic>Depth</italic>:&#x003D; maximum depth and <italic>Width</italic>:&#x003D; maximum width).</p>

<title>Time evolution</title>
<p>Simulations of the model occur in discrete time steps of length &#x0394;<italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 0.01. The input for an iteration of the model corresponding to time <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> includes a set of vectors (one for each of the cells coexisting in the model at that time) with the coordinates of the box occupied by the cell, and its state variables (amount of inhibitory molecules).</p>
<sec id="s9a2a">
<label>1.</label>
<title>OBL</title>
<p>The state variable considered in the model for the <italic>i</italic>-th OBL is the amount of activation inhibitor <italic>d<sub>Bi</sub></italic>. The corresponding vector is:

</disp-formula></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a2b">

<title>OBA</title>
<p>For each OBA there are three different inhibitory molecules, namely <italic>c<sub>A</sub></italic>, <italic>d<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>a<sub>A</sub></italic>, blocking cell division, differentiation and apoptosis. The state vector for the <italic>i</italic>-th OBA is:

<p>Differentiation of OCP into OCL is controlled by the inhibitor <italic>d<sub>P</sub></italic>, so that the state vector of the <italic>i</italic>-th OCP is given by:

<title>OCL</title>
<p>Active osteoclasts dig into old bone while alive before they die by apoptosis. The state vector for the <italic>i</italic>-th OCL includes the amount of apoptosis inhibitor <italic>a<sub>Ci</sub></italic>:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="318931_ueqn4.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Input also includes the values of bone density <italic>b</italic> and signals <italic>S</italic>, <italic>T</italic> and <italic>R</italic> at each box of the CA. The implementation was carried out with two different tools. The Mathematica platform (Wolfram Research, Inc., Mathematica, Version 9.0, Champaign, IL) was used to obtain <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The remaining figures and simulations were carried out with the open source <italic>Julia Language</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], which is endowed with internal mechanisms as <italic>multiple dispatch</italic> and JIT compilation that allowed us to significantly reduce the computational time.</p>
<p>Each iteration starts with the update of cell internal inhibitors according to the equations that describe the dynamics of the state variables (see Models Section). If neither the amount of bone at a box occupied by a OCL or some of the inhibitors goes to zero during a time step, the model moves to the next time step. Alternatively, the model displays different behaviors depending on what variable (or variables) have gone to zero:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a2e">
<label>1.</label>
<title>OBLs activation inhibitor (<italic>d<sub>B</sub></italic>)</title>
<p>This corresponds to the activation of one or more OBLs. In this case, the activated OBL are removed from the list of cells of the model, and their positions in the CA are occupied by newly formed OBAs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a2f">
<label>2.</label>
<title>OBAs division inhibitor (<italic>c<sub>A</sub></italic>)</title>
<p>OBAs form a growing front of cells that progresses by division behind the cutting cone created by OCLs. By construction, only OBAs that are not located in boxes adjacent to bone can divide. Moreover, OBA division can only occur if some of the neighboring positions is free. In this case, the position of a new OBA is selected at random from the free neighbors in the CA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a2g">
<label>4.</label>
<title>OCPs differentiation inhibitor (<italic>d<sub>P</sub></italic>)</title>
<p>OCPs are located adjacent to the layer of OBLs. In case of activation, the corresponding OCP is replaced by a newly formed OCL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a2h">
<label>5.</label>
<title>OCLs apoptosis inhibitor (<italic>a<sub>C</sub></italic>)</title>
<p>OCLs whose apoptosis inhibitor disappears are removed from the set of cells in the model for the next iteration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a2i">
<label>6.</label>
<title>Bone removal by OCPs (<italic>b<sub>P</sub></italic>)</title>
<p>OCLs remove old bone from the box where they are located according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">equation (7)</xref>.When the amount of bone goes to zero, the OCL moves to one of the unoccupied adjacent boxes in the bone matrix. The OCL chooses the closest box that is farther from the OBL layer. OBAs deposit osteoid matrix at a fixed rate in positions attached to bone, and where bone was previously removed from the box. After cell fate choices, the set of cells is updated. Cell produce signals which subsequently diffuse and decay. The model starts a new iteration.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s9a3">
<title>End of the simulation</title>
<p>Simulations end when the bone remodeling process is completed (old bone has been replaced by new osteoid matrix) and a new equilibrium (for signals <italic>S</italic> and <italic>T</italic>) has been reached. A video showing one sample of the simulation (from initial OCY apoptosis to final equilibrium and renewed bone) can be downloaded from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/144AT36uRrv1IZMFXLvNmulUmXQVaRbEl/view&#x003F;usp&#x003D;sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/144AT36uRrv1IZMFXLvNmulUmXQVaRbEl/view&#x003F;usp&#x003D;sharing</ext-link>.
