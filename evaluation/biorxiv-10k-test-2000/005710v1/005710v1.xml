<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The t(1; 11) translocation appears to be the causal genetic lesion with 70&#x0025; penetrance for schizophrenia, major depression, and other psychiatric disorders in a Scottish family. Molecular studies identified the disruption of the DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) gene by chromosome translocation at chromosome 1q42. Our previous studies, however, revealed that the translocation also disrupted another gene, Boymaw (also termed DISC1FP1), on chromosome 11. After translocation, two fusion genes (the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) and the Boymaw-DISC1 (BD13)) are generated between the DISC1 and Boymaw genes. In the present study, we report that expression of the DB7 fusion gene inhibits both intracellular NADH oxidoreductase activities and protein translation. We generated humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice with gene targeting to examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of the fusion genes. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on the DB7 fusion gene, protein translation activity is decreased in the hippocampus and in cultured primary neurons from the brains of the humanized mice. Expression of Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 proteins are also reduced. The humanized mice display prolonged and increased responses to the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, on various mouse genetic backgrounds. Abnormal information processing of acoustic startle and depressive-like behaviors are also observed. In addition, the humanized mice display abnormal erythropoiesis, which was reported to associate with depression in humans. Expression of the DB7 fusion gene may reduce protein translation to impair brain functions and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over twenty years ago, St Clair et al. reported a large Scottish family with major psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In this family, a balanced chromosome translocation t(1;11) co-segregates with schizophrenia, major depression, and other psychiatric disorders, suggesting the translocation as a causal genetic mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) gene was subsequently identified from the breakpoint of the translocation on chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Since then, the DISC1 gene has been extensively studied and proposed to play important roles in neuronal cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, maturation, and synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In a comprehensive summary of DISC1 studies, Brandon and Sawa provided a recent review on the potential roles of DISC1 in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Our previous studies, however, found that the translocation also disrupted another gene, Boymaw (also termed DISC1 fusion partner 1, DISC1FP1), on chromosome 11 in the Scottish family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). After translocation, the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) and the Boymaw-DISC1 (BD13) fusion genes are generated. The DB7 fusion protein is insoluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Insoluble DISC1 proteins were reported in the postmortem brains of sporadically collected patients with schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). These findings prompted us to study the functions of insoluble DB7 fusion protein in hopes of elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying the major psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the effects of full-length DISC1 (DISC1-FL), truncated DISC1, DISC1-Boymaw (DB7), and Boymaw-DISC1 (BD13) protein expression in different cell lines. We found that expression of the DB7 fusion gene inhibits oxidoreductase activities, rRNA synthesis, and protein translation. Humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice were generated via gene targeting to examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of the fusion genes. We confirmed inhibition of protein translation by the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene in the humanized mice. Molecular and behavioral characterizations of the humanized mice were also conducted.</p>

<title>MTT Reduction and DB7 Fusion Gene Expression</title>
<p>The DISC1 gene is mostly expressed in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). To examine potential functions of the DB7 fusion gene, we conducted our studies in HEK293T cells that share 90&#x0025; of expressed genes with human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The cDNA genes encoding DISC1-FL, truncated DISC1 (1&#x2013;597 aa), DISC1-Boymaw (DB7), and Boymaw-DISC1 (BD13) are tagged with an HA epitope at their C-terminal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Full-length DISC1-FL, truncated DISC1, and BD13 fusion proteins were abundantly expressed in contrast to low levels of DB7 fusion proteins exclusively found in the pellet fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, overexposure in Figure S1A). Similar expression patterns were also observed in transfected COS-7 cells (Figure S1B and S1C). Since we do not know what exact functions the DB7 protein may serve, we first chose an assay to measure the broad cellular activity of the cells transfected with these genes. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyliazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction assays were therefore conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Surprisingly, only the DB7 fusion gene expression significantly decreased MTT reduction while MTT reduction did not differ between cells expressing DISC1-FL, truncated DISC1, BD13, and GFP control genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Decreased MTT reduction by the DB7 fusion gene expression was also observed in both COS-7 and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Figure S1D and S1E). We were perplexed by the low expression of the DB7 fusion proteins because all expression constructs contain the same promoter and transcription terminator. One possible explanation could be that the DB7 mRNA is less stable than the mRNA transcripts of the other three genes. To examine such a possibility, bi-cistronic gene constructs were generated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). If the DB7 mRNA were unstable, we would expect little expression of the fluorescence marker gene downstream of the DB7 open reading frame (ORF). Surprisingly, expression of the fluorescence marker gene was not different between cells expressing any of the four bi-cistronic genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating no difference in their mRNA abundance. To examine whether low level expression of the DB7 fusion proteins may be caused by rapid protein degradation, we constructed fusion genes in which each gene was fused with a fluorescence timer (FT) E5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The fluorescence timer E5 proteins change color from green to red, 9 hr after translation. All fusion genes, except the DB7-FT, produced strong co-localized green and red fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, we could only detect weak green fluorescence in the absence of any red fluorescence in cells expressing the DB7-FT proteins, suggesting possible rapid protein degradation. In further support of this conclusion, addition of proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal (LLnL) to HEK293T cells transfected with the DB7 fusion gene remarkably increased the level of DB7 protein expression (Figure S1F). To provide direct evidence for rapid protein degradation, we performed a proteomic analysis of cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) (Figure S2A, S2B, and S2C). Total proteins from the DISC1-FL and the DB7 over-expression cells were labeled with 114 Da, 115 Da, 116 Da, and 117 Da mass tags, respectively. Hundreds of unique DISC1 peptides were identified in cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene, and their average abundance was about 70&#x0025; of that in cells expressing the DISC1-FL gene. The abundance of a representative DISC1 peptide is shown between cells expressing full-length DISC1 and the DB7 fusion genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We conclude that these abundant DISC1 peptides from cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene are likely peptide fragments generated by rapid protein degradation within the cell.</p>

<title>Characterization of the Boymaw Gene</title>
<p>Since the truncated DISC1 proteins did not decrease MTT reduction, we wondered whether the Boymaw, rather than the DISC1, was responsible for both decreased MTT reduction and rapid protein turnover of the DB7 fusion proteins. Boymaw was therefore in-frame fused at the C-terminal of a randomly selected gene (the fluorescence timer E5 proteins, FT-Boymaw) to follow the same fusion pattern of the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast to strong green and red fluorescence in cells expressing the control construct FT, weak green fluorescence was detected in the absence of red fluorescence in cells expressing the FT-Boymaw fusion gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with the fluorescence images, Western blot analyses detected abundant control FT proteins with little FT-Boymaw fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). A significant decrease of MTT reduction was also observed in cells expressing the FT-Boymaw fusion gene in comparison with the controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These data indicate that the Boymaw cause decreased MTT reduction as well as rapid protein turnover of both the FT-Boymaw and the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) fusion proteins. To investigate whether the inhibition of MTT reduction causes rapid protein turnover or vice versa, a series of C-terminal deletions of the FT-Boymaw gene were generated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The C4-del was as effective as the FT-Boymaw in decreasing MTT reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, deletion of a short C-terminal sequence in the C4-del dramatically improved protein stability in contrast to barely detectable FT-Boymaw (FT-B) fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The C2-del had a comparable MTT reduction to the controls (FT) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), but was less abundant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These data indicate that different, although overlapping, regions of the Boymaw gene contribute to the regulation of rapid protein turnover and inhibition of MTT reduction.</p>

<title>Reduced NADH Oxidoreductase Activities</title>
<p>Our studies found that decreased MTT reduction is not caused by reduced proliferation of the cells expressing the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) fusion gene (Figure S3A). To rule out potential differences in MTT uptake in living cells, the transfected cells were partially lysed for the MTT assay. DB7 cell lysate display a similar magnitude of MTT reduction deficit to the living cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These data therefore indicate that intracellular MTT reduction activities are decreased in DB7 expressing cells. NADH oxidoreductases are major intracellular electron donors in the reduction of MTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We therefore first examined whether NADH concentration was decreased in cells expressing the DB7 gene. No significant difference in intracellular NADH was found between cells expressing DISC1-FL and DB7 genes (Figure S3B). Cytosolic NADH concentration was also examined with NADH fluorescence sensor Peredox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), and no difference was found either (Figure S3C). To further examine whether NADH oxidoreductase activities were reduced in DB7 expressing cells, recombinant <italic>E coli</italic> NADH alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which catalyzes MTT reduction in the presence of NADH, was added to the DISC1-FL and DB7 cell lysates, respectively. Addition of the ADH dramatically increased MTT reduction in the DB7 cell lysate, but not in the DISC1-FL cell lysate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These data indicate that the DB7 cell lysate have decreased activities of NADH oxidoreductases. To localize the NADH oxidoreductases, we conducted density-gradient ultracentrifugation to isolate both mitochondria and microsomes (fragmented endoplasmic reticulum). Western blot analyses demonstrated enriched expression of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial fraction and cytochrome p450 reductase in the microsomal fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). A significant decrease of MTT reduction was observed in both mitochondrial and microsomal fractions from the cells expressing the DB7 gene. Further analysis identified a significant reduction of cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) proteins in the microsomal fraction of the cells expressing DB7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, 3E). No differential CYB5R3 expression was detected between DISC1-FL and DB7 in either cell homogenate or mitochondria.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> HEK293T cells were transfected with DISC1-FL and DB7 respectively. Two days after transfection, MTT reduction was performed in both living cells and cell lysate respectively. Student&#x2019;s t-tests (unpaired, two-tailed) were used to compare MTT reduction between DISC1-FL and DB7 in living cells and cell lysate respectively. The mean value of the MTT reduction in cells transfected with DISC1-FL was used as the control (100&#x0025;) to calculate relative MTT reduction for DB7 in each group. Significantly decreased MTT reduction in DB7 transfection was observed in living cells (n &#x003D; 3) (t(4)&#x003D;10.74, p &#x003C; 0.001).and cell lysate (n &#x003D; 6) (t(10)&#x003D;4.92, <sup>&#x0023;&#x0023;&#x0023;</sup> p &#x003C; 0.001). <bold>(B)</bold> Reversal of MTT reduction deficit in cell lysate.

Addition of the ADH did not completely reverse the deficit of MTT reduction in DB7 lysate in comparison with DISC1-FL lysate (t(22)&#x003D;4.26, <sup>&#x0023;&#x0023;&#x0023;</sup>p &#x003C; 0.001).

No difference was found in MTT reduction of the DISC1-FL cell lysate with or without ADH. The mean value of the MTT reduction of DISC1-FL samples without ADH was used as the control (100&#x0025;) to calculate relative MTT reduction for DB7, DISC1-FL&#x002B;ADH, and DB7&#x002B;ADH, <bold>(C)</bold> Purification of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from transfected HEK293T cells using density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Large amount of cells was transfected for each purification experiment. Cytochrome c and cytochrome p450 reductase were used as marker proteins for mitochondria and ER respectively. MTT reduction assays were conducted in purified mitochondria and ER from HEK293T cells transfected with DISC1-FL and DB7 constructs. The value of MTT reduction was further normalized with total amount of proteins in mitochondria and ER, respectively. Significantly reduced MTT reduction was observed in both mitochondria (n &#x003D; 6)(t(10)&#x003D;5.53, two-tailed, p &#x003C; 0.001) and ER (n &#x003D; 6)(t(10)&#x003D;6.59, two-tailed, <sup>&#x0023;&#x0023;&#x0023;</sup> p &#x003C; 0.001) isolated from cells transfected with DB7 expression construct. <bold>(D)</bold> The level of CYB5R3 protein expression was examined with Western blot analysis, and normalized with the expression of ER marker cytochrome p450 reductase (CYPOR).

<p>To fully characterize the effects of the DB7 fusion gene expression, we conducted proteomic analysis of cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene. We did not find additional candidate NADH oxidoreductases whose expression was significantly decreased (Figure S2A, S2B, S2C, and Table S1). Several reasons could account for the results. First, proteomic analysis can only survey a portion of total cellular proteins. Second, we found that expression of several NADH oxidoreductases was decreased, but did not reach statistical significance because of a limited number of identified peptides. Third, NADH oxidoreductase activities are modulated not only by protein expression but also by protein modifications. The molecular nature of the reduced activities of NADH oxidoreductases in cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene remains to be fully investigated. Among the top 18 differentially expressed proteins ranked according to their p values, however, seven were directly involved in the regulation of protein translation (Figure S2C).</p>

<title>Inhibition of rRNA Expression and Protein Translation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To investigate whether expression of the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) fusion gene alters protein translation, we first examined rRNA expression in cells expressing the DISC1-FL, truncated DISC1, DB7, and BD13 genes, respectively. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction of total RNA in cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Reduction of the total RNA was not caused by differential cell proliferation (Figure S3D). Since rRNA makes up more than 80&#x0025; of total RNA, we quantified the expression of both 28S and 18S rRNAs. Reduction of both 28S and 18S rRNAs was found only in cells expressing the DB7, not the other three genes. Consistent with the effects of the DB7 fusion gene expression, expression of the FT-Boymaw fusion gene also decreased total RNA and rRNA expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To provide direct evidence for inhibition of protein translation, we conducted SUnSET (surface sensing of translation) experiments to measure protein translation in the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). In the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein translation, we detected little puromycin incorporation in newly synthesized proteins in Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In pulse-labeling experiments, we found significant reduction of puromycin labeling from cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene, suggesting decreased protein translation activities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). There was no significant difference in puromycin labeling between cells expressing the other three genes. We confirmed that expression of the FT-Boymaw fusion gene also inhibits protein translation similar to the DB7 fusion gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). All together, it appears that it is the Boymaw gene, rather than the DISC1 gene, that contributes to the inhibition of oxidoreductase activities, rRNA expression, and protein translation in both the DISC1-Boymaw and FT-Boymaw fusion genes. We did not observe any changes of these cellular activities in cells expressing the full-length DISC1, truncated DISC1, or the Boymaw-DISC1 fusion genes.</p>

<title>Generation of Humanized DISC1-Boymaw Mice</title>
<p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of the DB7 fusion gene, we generated humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice. Human DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene (DB7) and Boymaw-DISC1 fusion gene (BD13) were knocked-in to replace mouse endogenous <italic>disc1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). A bi-cistronic gene, consisting of the two fusion genes connected with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), was designed to splice with exon 1 of human DISC1 gene. The bi-cistronic cassette was also flanked with two <italic>loxP</italic> sites upstream of a human DISC1 gene for future genetic rescue experiments. Germ-line transmission of the bi-cistronic gene was obtained. To examine whether the bi-cistronic gene is expressed and correctly spliced with exon 1, we conducted RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from the brains of humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice (DISC1<sup>H</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). A 150 bp DNA fragment was specifically amplified. Further sequencing confirmed the correct splicing (data not shown). Before examination of the expression of the DB7 proteins of the bi-cistronic gene in the humanized mice, we first evaluated eight different anti-DISC1 antibodies using our DISC1 over-expressing cell lysates (Figure S4A). Five antibodies (ab55808, ab62069, ab59017,3D4, and 14F2) with the highest affinities to human DISC1 proteins were selected for Western blot detection of the DB7 fusion protein. Unfortunately, there were extensive non-specific cross-reactions of the antibodies with proteins from mouse brain homogenate in Western blot analysis (data not shown), preventing the detection of the fusion proteins. However, the antibodies have less background in Western blot analyses of mouse primary neuron culture (personal communication with Dr. Hongjun Song). We therefore performed our analyses in cultured primary neurons from neonatal mice. The antibody against the N-terminal residues of human DISC1 protein recognized a 75 kD protein band in Western blot analysis of the primary neurons from the humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice, but not wildtype mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Two reasons support this band as the DB7 fusion protein. First, the protein band is about the calculated size of the DB7 fusion protein (73 kD). Second, the absence of this band in wildtype mice rules it out as a non-specific cross-reaction of the antibody. To detect the expression of the BD13 proteins of the bi-cistronic gene, we further screened the DISC1 antibodies in our BD13 over-expressing cell lysate. Two antibodies recognizing the C-terminal residues of human DISC1 proteins displayed some, but not high (compared with anti-HA antibody), affinity to the BD13 proteins (Figure S4B). Due to the low affinity of the two antibodies, we could not detect the expression of the BD13 proteins expected to be around 17 kD (Figure S4C, S4D). To further confirm the expression of the DB7 fusion proteins, immunocytochemical analyses were conducted. Co-localization of the DB7 proteins with neuronal cell marker MAP2 was observed in the primary neurons from the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Expression of the DB7 protein did not cause gross anatomical abnormalities in the brain of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (Figure S5). To examine whether expression of the DB7 fusion protein decreases MTT reduction <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed MTT reduction assays in the brain homogenate of neonatal heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw and wildtype control mice. A significantly decreased MTT reduction was observed in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Western blot analysis also confirmed a significant decrease of Cyb5r3 proteins in ER isolated from the brains of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

<p>We were particularly interested in the inhibition of both rRNA expression and protein translation in HEK293T cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene.

<title>Decreased Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 Expression</title>
<p>We next examined whether general inhibition of protein translation in the humanized mice reduces protein expression of genes critical for pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Genes encoding Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 proteins were examined because of their central roles in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission as well as synaptogenesis. There are also many reports on their down-regulation in psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), and degradation of PSD95 is proposed to play a key role in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). We first conducted real-time RT-PCR quantification of their RNA expression, and did not find significant reduction in the humanized mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). To examine their protein expression, we conducted Western blot analyses. Significant reduction of Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 was observed in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). No significant difference was found in synaptophysin. It has been reported that neural circuitry activity can regulate Gad67 gene expression at the system level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). To rule out any potential effects from differential neural circuitry activity of individual mice, we examined Gad67 expression in primary neuron culture. Reduction of Gad67 proteins was remarkable in the primary neurons isolated from both E18.5 embryos and postnatal day 1 (P1) DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Moderate reduction of Psd95 was also observed. Expression of Nmdar1 was very low and inconclusive.

Gad67 and Nmdar1 proteins displayed similar expression patterns between the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice and wildtype siblings. In the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mouse brains, there is no obvious loss of Gad67 positive cortical GABAergic interneurons (data not shown). Anti-Psd95 antibody did not work on mouse paraffin sections. We also included anti-parvalbumin antibody in the analysis to examine whether this major subgroup of cortical GABAergic interneurons may be abnormal in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice.

<title>Behavioral Analyses of the Humanized DISC1-Boymaw Mice</title>
<p>Since the DB7 fusion gene is a gain-of-function mutation in inhibiting protein translation, the function of the fusion gene was therefore studied in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice.

By following the recommendation of using F1 genetic background by Banbury Conference on Genetic Background in Mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), we generated heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice on F1 129S/C57 genetic background for behavioral studies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). In the F1 generation, both wildtype and the DISC1-Boymaw heterozygous mice carry one allele of mouse wildtype <italic>Disc1</italic> gene. The DISC1-Boymaw heterozygous mice were healthy and indistinguishable from their wildtype sibling mice. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and habituation of acoustic startle were examined because they are both deficient in patients with schizophrenia and/or other major psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). No differences in PPI (100 msec interstimulus interval; ISI), startle, or startle habituation were found between the genotypes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>). However, we noticed that there was a large startle variation between individuals with a significant number of mice with low startle (below 50)(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), which could complicate the measurement of PPI. The source of such a large startle variation remains unknown since there is no genetic segregation in F1 generation. Schizophrenia patients are reported to have high sensitivity and prolonged responses to ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Cortical GABAergic inhibitory interneurons have been proposed to be the primary targets of NMDAR antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In light of our findings of reduced Nmdar1 and Gad67 proteins, we examined responses of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw male mice to ketamine in the mouse Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). A significant gene by ketamine interaction was observed (F(1,27)&#x003D;4.30, p &#x003C; 0.05). <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses revealed that the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw male mice display a larger increase in total distance traveled (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>), counts (Figure S7A), and transitions (Figure S7B) than sibling wildtype mice in locomotion after ketamine injection. It is unlikely that less locomotion of the wildtype mice results from ketamine overdose, since we did not observe initial suppression and later increase of locomotion by ketamine overdosing in the wildtype mice. However, multiple dosages of ketamine are needed to fully address the ketamine sensitivity of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice in the future.</p>

<p>We next examined the behavioral phenotypes of the humanized mice in the absence of full-length wildtype <italic>Disc1</italic> gene on 129S genetic background (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). Because wildtype 129S mice carry mutant <italic>disc1</italic> genes, we define that &#x201C;wildtype mice&#x201D; in our studies refer to mice that do not carry the knocked-in DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene, rather than refer to the status of mouse endogenous <italic>disc1</italic> gene. Both wildtype and heterozygous mice were healthy; however, male heterozygous mice were slightly, but significantly, smaller than their wildtype littermates (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). No significant body weight difference was observed in females between the two genotypes. In contrast to mice on mixed 129S/C57 genetic background, mice on 129S pure genetic background have higher startle with less variation between individuals (Figure S8A), which makes the 129S genetic background more suitable for PPI studies. To extend the PPI studies with ISI at 100 msec in the F1 mice, we performed PPI tests with various ISIs in this cohort. When PPI was conducted with a short ISI at 25 msec, however, enhanced PPI, or impaired prepulse facilitation, was observed in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice, suggesting abnormal information processing (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). After ketamine administration in the BPM, significant gene (F(1,52)&#x003D;11.42, p &#x003C; 0.01), ketamine (F(152)&#x003D;24.06, p &#x003C; 0.0001), and gene X ketamine X sex interaction (F(1,52)&#x003D;5.40, p &#x003C; 0.05) effects were observed in total distance traveled. In male mice, a significant gene X ketamine interaction (F(1,26)&#x003D;8.61, p &#x003C; 0.01) was observed in the distance traveled (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>) and other measures of locomotion activity (Figure S8B, S8C, S8D). <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses revealed significantly increased locomotion in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice injected with ketamine in all blocks except the first and last, suggesting increased and prolonged responses to ketamine. In female mice, a significant gene effect (F(1,26)&#x003D;5.63, p &#x003C; 0.05) was detected without gene X ketamine interaction (Figure S8E). To examine whether the heterozygous mice display behavioral phenotypes related to depression, a tail suspension test was conducted to assess mouse behavioral despair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).

<p>DISC1-Boymaw mice displayed significantly more immobility time than wildtype sibling controls without sex effects (p &#x003C; 0.05)(<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). A saccharin preference test was also conducted to examine anhedonia-like behavior, as seen in depression in humans, in the heterozygous mice. Wildtype female mice displayed significantly higher preference for saccharin than the heterozygous female mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). Because wildtype male mice had no significant preference for saccharin, the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw male mice cannot be assessed for depression-like behavior using this behavioral paradigm (Figure S8F). It has been reported that some rodent strains display a sex difference in saccharin preference in which females have strong preference while males have little preference or even some avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In general, 129S mice are reported to have only slight saccharin preference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.criver.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/129.pdf">http://www.criver.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/129.pdf</ext-link>). These findings may explain why wildtype male mice on the 129S background did not display saccharin preference. Taken together, the humanized DISC1-Boymaw male mice consistently displayed a prolonged response to ketamine on different genetic backgrounds, mimicking phenotypes of schizophrenia and potentially depression. Replication of this phenotype in different cohorts of mice helped rule out type I error by multiple comparisons. Abnormal information processing of startle and depressive-related behaviors have also been suggested, and further confirmation is needed in future.</p>

<title>Abnormal Erythropoiesis in Humanized DISC1-Boymaw Mice</title>
<p>Mutations of ribosomal protein genes, which impair protein translation, have been demonstrated to cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Since the human DISC1 gene is also expressed in lymphoblastoid cells, we conducted hematological analysis of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice to investigate whether inhibition of protein translation by the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene may cause anemia (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>). Interestingly, 2 out of 10 heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw male mice displayed lower concentrations of hemoglobin (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>)(Table S2), indicating different degrees of anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). A significant difference between the two genotypes is an increase of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), which measures the variation of red blood cell volume, in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>). We re-examined RDW in some of these mice one week later to investigate RDW stability. RDW displayed little change in wildtype mice, but higher RDW fluctuation was observed in their sibling heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>). These data indicated that the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene impairs the stability of erythropoiesis in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The t(1;11) chromosome translocation in the Scottish family co-segregates with schizophrenia and major depression with 70&#x0025; penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Despite extensive studies on the DISC1 gene, the role of the disruption of the DISC1 gene alone remains unclear in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Our previous studies revealed that the DISC1 gene disruption is accompanied by disruption of the Boymaw gene and generation of the DISC1-Boymaw and Boymaw-DISC1 fusion genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In the present study, we found that expression of the DB7 fusion gene decreases NADH oxidoreductase activities, rRNA synthesis, and protein translation in both <italic>in vitro</italic> cell studies and <italic>in vivo</italic> humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice. Despite inhibition of protein translation by the DB7 fusion gene, however, we did not find gross anatomical abnormalities in the brain of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice.</p>
<p>Inhibition of protein translation does not always cause obvious developmental defects. For example, reduced protein translation by silencing translational initiation factor eIF4E isoform (IFE-2) has no effects on <italic>C. elegans</italic> development and body size at 20 &#x00B0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Even though we did not find obvious developmental abnormalities, reduced expression of Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 proteins was observed in the brain of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice. Behavioral studies showed that the humanized mice display phenotypes related to both schizophrenia and depression. Our studies therefore suggest that the DB7 fusion gene could be one of the causal gene mutation(s) in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders in the Scottish family. It should be kept in mind, however, that the humanized mice also harbor the BD13 fusion gene in addition to the DB7 fusion gene. Reduction of protein translation in the brains of the humanized mice is likely caused by the expression of the DB7 fusion gene, according to our <italic>in vitro</italic> cell transfection studies. However, we cannot rule out a potential contribution from the BD13 fusion gene to the behavioral phenotypes, although we did not find any cellular phenotypes in HEK293T cells expressing the BD13 fusion gene.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that the DB7 fusion protein is unstable and its expression decreases intracellular oxidoreductase activities, rRNA synthesis, and protein translation. These phenotypes are unlikely caused by the insolubility of the DB7 proteins <italic>per se</italic>, since the much more abundant insoluble DISC1 and truncated DISC1 proteins did not generate any of these cellular phenotypes in the over-expressing HEK293T cells. However, the insoluble DISC1 proteins in HEK293T cells may be structurally different from the insoluble proteins found in postmortem human brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Surprisingly, fusion of the Boymaw gene to a randomly selected gene (fluorescence marker) generated the same cellular phenotypes as the DB7 fusion gene. It will be interesting to know whether the human Boymaw gene encodes any protein or peptide. Regardless of the Boymaw gene being a coding or non-coding RNA, the DB7 fusion gene appears to be a gain-of-function mutation. The role of the Boymaw gene merits further studies. Unfortunately, there is no human Boymaw gene orthologue in mouse genome.</p>
<p>Eykelenboom et al identified three different fusion transcripts from the patient lymphoblastoid cells from the Scottish family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). The DB7 fusion gene used in our studies encodes exactly the same fusion protein as their CP60 transcript. The second CP69 fusion transcript is generated by alternative splicing 12 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon of the CP60 transcript. Our deletion analysis demonstrated that the last few amino acid residues of Boymaw are not required for inhibition of MTT reduction. Therefore, it is likely that the CP69 fusion protein is also capable of inhibiting MTT reduction. The third CP1 fusion transcript encodes a protein with just one more amino acid addition to the C-terminus of the truncated DISC1 protein that has been used in the generation of several mouse DISC1 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). The CP1 protein does not display any detectable toxicity to mitochondria, which is consistent with our observation that over-expression of truncated DISC1 proteins has no effect on MTT reduction, rRNA expression, and protein translation. Our immunocytochemical analysis confirmed localization of the DB7 fusion protein (but not DISC1-FL, truncated DISC1, or BD13) in mitochondria (Figure S9). Interestingly, MTT reduction was also reduced in mitochondria of cells expressing the DB7 fusion gene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Decreased activities of mitochondrial NADH oxidoreductases may relate to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells expressing the DB7 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that reduction of oxidoreductase activity may decrease cell metabolism to down-regulate rRNA expression and protein translation. One potential pathway could be that inhibition of the mitochondrial oxidoreductase activities reduces ATP production (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>), which is supported by the finding of loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells expressing the DB7 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Reduction of ATP can trigger activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cell energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). The AMPK pathway is a well established pathway to regulate protein translation. In this pathway, the activated AMPK phosphorylates TSC1/TSC2 to inhibit mTOR. mTOR kinase plays a central role to stimulate protein translation either directly via activation of translational initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) or indirectly via phosphorylating transcription initiation factor TIF-1A to promote rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Mutation of TSC1/TSC2 leads to autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), which shares many common psychopathological features with major psychiatric disorders. Another potential pathway linking cellular metabolism to rRNA transcription could be initiated through the Sirtuin family of proteins, which are NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-dependent deacetylase to sense cellular NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> changes. SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) has been demonstrated to epigenetically silence rDNA chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). However, it is also reported that nucleolar SIRT7 (Sirtuin 7) functions as an activator for rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). It is clear that the potential underlying mechanisms are complex and much more work is needed.</p>

<p>One of the key questions is how expression of the DB7 fusion protein reduces oxidoreductase activity. Identification of these NADH oxidoreductases in mitochondrion and cytoplasm is critical to unravel the signaling pathways from cellular metabolic activity to protein translation. In contrast to inhibition of protein translation by the DB7 fusion gene, exaggerated protein translation has been suggested as the core pathophysiology of Fragile X Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) and other autism genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). It is possible that an optimal protein translation is necessary for neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), and excessive or less protein translation are harmful to brain functions. Translational control of protein synthesis may play important roles in many other psychiatric disorders. Indeed, it was reported that hypermethylation of ribosomal RNA gene promoter was associated with suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>), mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), as well as Huntington&#x2019;s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Considering that rRNA synthesis is a rate-limiting step of ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), reduction of rRNA will likely result in a decrease of protein translation. Our SUnSET experiments clearly demonstrated inhibition of protein translation in both the cells transiently expressing the DB7 fusion gene and the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice. Since we did not find significant reduction of mRNA transcripts of <italic>Gad67</italic>, <italic>Nmdar1</italic>, and <italic>Psd95</italic> genes, the reduction of general protein translation therefore could be responsible for the decrease of Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 protein expression in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice. Indeed, it was reported that cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). However, it is also possible that protein turnover may be altered and contributes to the reduction of these proteins in the humanized mice. The effects of the expression of the DB7 gene may not be restricted to the inhibition of protein translation. For example, we observed reduced expression of Cyb5r3 reductase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the enzyme plays an important role in lipid biosynthesis and has been demonstrated to be essential for brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>).</p>
<p>Impaired NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission has been well established in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Prolonged ketamine effects and exacerbation of symptoms are observed in schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and our mouse genetic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Consistent with the findings in human patients, we found reduction of both Nmdar1 and Gad67 proteins in heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice which display prolonged responses to the noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist, ketamine. This phenotype has been replicated in different cohorts of mice on various genetic backgrounds regardless of the presence or absence of wildtype <italic>Disc1</italic> gene. It is unknown why the female humanized mice do not show prolonged responses to ketamine. The female humanized mice are not symptom-free, since they display abnormal phenotypes in other behavioral paradigms. We found increased PPI in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice at a short ISI (25 msec) in both sexes. In mice, PPI diminishes with decreasing ISI starting from 100 msec, and eventually transforms into prepulse facilitation. Abnormally enhanced PPI at short ISI is indicative of altered information processing in the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice. Although this alteration in PPI differs from that seen in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>), enhanced PPI at short ISI has been reported in rats treated with dopamine receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>).</p>
<p>Inhibition of protein translation by the fusion gene impacts not only the brain but also erythropoiesis of the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice. We found an incomplete penetrance of the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene to anemia, consistent with the role of impaired protein translation demonstrated by ribosomal protein gene mutations in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Interestingly, the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice also display increased RDW. In human, over 2 million red blood cells are generated every second with small variation in cell volume (human RDW: 11.5&#x2013;14.5&#x0025;). It is possible that such an extremely active and precise biological process in mouse is highly susceptible to the DISC1-Boymaw mutation which confers even mild inhibition of protein translation. Recently, an association between increased RDW and depression was reported from a multi-year large scale study in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). The study found a gradient positive correlation between increased RDW and the risk of developing depression in thousands of patients. It will be interesting to know whether patients with major depression in the Scottish family may display increased RDW.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that our studies are focused on the investigation of the biological functions of the DISC1-Boymaw fusion genes. To that end, the 129S genetic background, which contains a frame-shift mutation in endogenous <italic>disc1</italic> gene, provides a unique advantage for our studies to avoid <italic>Disc1</italic> gene dosage difference between wildtype and the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice. However, the chromosome translocation in the Scottish family generates not only the fusion genes but also loss of one allele of the <italic>DISC1</italic> gene. Therefore, our humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice on 129S background should be viewed as a genetic model for the DISC1-Boymaw fusion genes rather than the chromosome translocation in the Scottish family. In the future, we could generate mice carrying full-length human <italic>DISC1</italic> genes on mouse <italic>Disc1</italic> locus using the <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase. After breeding these <italic>DISC1</italic> mice with the heterozygous DISC1-Boymaw mice, we could generate wildtype mice carrying two human <italic>DISC1</italic> (<italic>DISC1/DISC1</italic>) genes and heterozygous mice carrying one human <italic>DISC1</italic> and one DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene (<italic>DISC1/DISC1<sup>H</sup></italic>). Comparisons between wildtype (<italic>DISC1/DISC1</italic>) and the heterozygous (<italic>DISC1/DISC1<sup>H</sup></italic>) will provide a more complete model for the chromosome translocation in the Scottish family.</p>

<title>Generation of humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice</title>
<p>Both DB7 and BD13 fusion genes were connected with IRES of EMCV virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). The bi-cistronic gene was terminated with SV40 poly (A). A splicing acceptor was added to generate in-frame splicing of the bi-cistron with the first exon of human DISC1 gene. The bicistron gene cassette was flanked with two <italic>loxP</italic> sites. Downstream of the bi-cistron, human DISC1 cDNA was capped with a splicing acceptor. Such a design aimed for conditional restoration of DISC1 gene expression in genetic rescue experiments in the future. Two homology arms with respective sizes of 4 kb and 3 kb were amplified from the mouse disc1 gene of 129S ES cells (129S2/SvPasCrl) to assemble the final gene targeting construct. The final gene targeting construct was electroporated into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. After positive and negative selections with G418 and ganciclovir, about 1500 ES cell colonies were picked for further screening. Two homologous recombinant ES cell colonies were identified. After blastocyst injection, chimeric mice were obtained and bred with 129S females for germline transmission of the targeted DISC1 allele.</p>
