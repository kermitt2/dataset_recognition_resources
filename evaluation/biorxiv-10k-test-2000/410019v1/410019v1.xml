<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Topological entanglements severely interfere with important biological processes. For this reason, genomes must be kept unknotted and unlinked during most of a cell cycle. Type 2 Topoisomerase (TopoII) enzymes play an important role in this process but the precise mechanisms yielding systematic disentanglement of DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> are not clear. Here we report computational evidence that Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) proteins &#x2013; such as cohesins and condensins &#x2013; can cooperate with TopoII to establish a synergistic mechanism to resolve topological entanglements: SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localisation of entanglements in turn increasing the topological pressure within knotted or linked regions. As a consequence, knots, links and ensuing entanglements may be readily simplified by Topoisomerase enzymes even in crowded and confined conditions. The mechanism we uncover is universal in that it does not qualitatively depend on the specific substrate, whether DNA or chromatin, or on the processivity of the SMC proteins; we thus argue that this synergy may be at work across organisms and throughout the cell cycle.</p>

<body>
<p>Genomes are stored in extremely confined and highly crowded environments, yet they must be kept largely free of entanglements during most of the cell cycle. Failing to do so leads to a proliferation of topological issues that can stop gene transcription, DNA replication or cell division, eventually leading to cell death [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although TopoII proteins are known to play a crucial role in mediating topological changes on DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the precise pathways employed by these proteins to maintain the genome disentangled is still poorly understood [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> and under dilute conditions, TopoII proteins efficiently resolve topological entanglements and stabilise a population of knotted DNA below the expected value in thermodynamic equilibrium [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings can be partially explained by a model where TopoII enzymes recognise specific DNA-DNA juxtapositions [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Yet, how this model can lead to efficient unknotting and unlinking in crowded environments and crumpled DNA or chromatin substrates is unclear [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Even more intriguing is the <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental finding that, in presence of polycations [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or with superstochiometric abundance of TopoII [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the action of these proteins may <italic>increase</italic> the topological complexity of the substrates [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
<p>While it has been suggested that DNA supercoiling may provide a solution for this problem by promoting hooked DNA juxtapositions [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], this argument is valid only for naked, highly supercoiled DNAs such as the ones found in bacteria. The understanding of how efficient topological simplification is achieved in eukaryotes where the genome is packaged into chromatin [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] remains, on the other hand, an outstanding and unresolved problem [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we propose a novel mechanism of efficient topological simplification in DNA and chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> that is based on the synergistic action of SMC-driven loop extrusion [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x2013; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (or ratcheted diffusion [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) and TopoII. Irrespectively of the precise processive mechanism employed by SMC proteins we show that their loading and sliding along chromatin is sufficient to localise any knotted and linked regions in turn catalysing their topological simplification. Our results reveal that this mechanism is independent of either, the degree of condensation of the substrate or environmental crowding, and is therefore likely to lead to unknotting and unlinking even under the extreme packaging conditions of DNA in the cell nucleus. We finally discuss our model in the context of recent experiments showing that SMC proteins are required to achieve correct sister chromatid decatenation in metaphase [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], reporting frequent DNA damage in front of cohesin motion [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and identifying a remarkable low frequency of knots in intracellular chromatin [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s1a"><title>Model and System Set Up</title>
<p>We perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations of a generic polymer substrate modelled as a semi-flexbile beadspring circular chain of 500 beads of size <italic>&#x03C3;</italic>, taken to be 2.5 nm for DNA [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and 10 or 30 nm for chromatin [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This model captures physical properties expected for generic polymeric substrates [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and we consider knotted and linked chains as representative of topological entanglements typically occurring in genetic materials [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Note that we focus on circular chains to simplify the computational task of monitoring the topological changes of the substrate but, as we discuss below, this is not a crucial requirement for the proposed mechanism to work.</p>

<p>Unlike previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], we employ a model of chromosomes that forbids strand-crossing events. This is achieved by imposing that any pair of consecutive beads along the chain are connected by finitely extensible (FENE) springs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] while non-consecutive ones are subject to a purely repulsive (WCA) potential. By adding a Kratky-Porod term with a given bending modulus we describe chains with <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = 20<italic>&#x03C3;</italic>. Note, however, that the results are not qualitatively affected by this choice.</p>

<sec id="s1b"><title>A slip-link model for SMC</title>
<p>The SMC family of proteins, including condensin and cohesin complexes, is a ubiquitous architectural element that plays vital roles in both interphase and mitosis [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and across organisms [<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. SMC proteins are known to regulate genome architecture by topologically embracing the chromatin fibre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and sliding, either processively [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or diffusively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], along it.</p>
<p>Based on this evidence, previous works have crudely modelled SMC proteins as harmonic bonds joining two non-consecutive and dynamically updated chromosome segments [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast with these models, here we account for both the steric hindrance and the slip-link nature of the SMC complex by forcing the maximum extension of the bond with a FENE potential so that it is energetically unfavorable for a third bead to cross through the gap in between the joined segments.</p>
<p>The two chromosome segments bound by the SMC protein at time <italic>t</italic> (or the SMC &#x201C;heads&#x201D;) are denoted as <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and updated at rate <italic>&#x03BA;</italic> (see SI). Since we focus on processive complexes, the location of the heads is updated as <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic> &#x002B; <italic>dt</italic>) = <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x002B; 1 and <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic> &#x002B; <italic>dt</italic>) = <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&#x2212;</italic>1, if the Euclidean distance between the next pair of beads is shorter than 1.3<italic>&#x03C3;</italic>, or kept still otherwise. This rule ensures that no third bead can pass through the segments bonded by the SMC protein during the update step and it effectively slows down the processivity of the complex depending on DNA structure. Yet, we stress that the speed of the extrusion (or diffusion) process does not qualitatively affect the synergistic mechanism found here, only its overall completion time.</p>

<sec id="s1c"><title>Loop Extrusion or Ratcheted Diffusion of SMC Proteins Localises Topological Entanglements</title>
<p>Thermally equilibrated knotted or linked polymers in a good solvent display topological entanglements that are naturally only weakly localised [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]: this means that the &#x201C;size&#x201D; of the entanglement [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] grows sublinearly with the length of the whole molecule (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finite size effects and large persistence lengths generally enhance the spreading of the entanglement [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and this trend is dramatically enhanced under confinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and for polymers within crowded environments [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], all conditions typically found <italic>in vivo</italic>. The spreading of entanglements likely hinders TopoIImediated simplification of the substrate and it is thus natural to ask if there exists a physiological mechanism that may counteract this topological de-localisation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To address this question we performed BD simulations initialised from equilibrated conditions displaying de-localised entanglements and, at time <italic>t</italic> = 0, we loaded a SMC complex at a random position along the substrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The ensuing extrusion, or growth, of the subtended loop can be monitored by tracking the location of the SMC heads <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) (see blue curves in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). At the same time, we used well-established existing algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] (publicly accessible through the server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kymoknot">http://kymoknot</ext-link>. sissa.it [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) to compute the knot size &#x2013; i.e., the shortest portion of the chain hosting the knot. [Note that this is a &#x201C;physical knot&#x201D; as a closure procedure is required before its identification through topological invariants.] We observed that the knot (grey shaded area in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), initially spanning a large portion of the polymer, progressively shrinks into a region whose boundaries match the location of the SMC heads. Notably, in the large time limit, all the essential crossings forming the knot (in this case a trefoil, 3<sub>1</sub>) were observed to be localised within a segment much shorter than the full polymer length (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). A similar localisation effect could be achieved on a pair of Hopf-linked polymers (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="410019_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to stress that the discovered SMC-mediated localisation effect is not strictly due to the processivity of the protein and may also be achieved even if SMC slides diffusively along DNA [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To localise an entanglement via diffusing slip-link-like elements one would require a number of SMC proteins that increases with the entropic pressure of the knot (or link) which needs to be overcome [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Additionally, we highlight that a mechanism of ratcheted diffusion with specific loading sites for the SMC protein (such as NIPBL for the SMC cohesin complex [<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]) would further enhance the efficiency of topological localisation with respect to diffusive SMC loaded randomly along the fibre [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We conclude this section by mentioning that this localisation mechanism does not require a circular substrate to function. Indeed, physiologically occurring loops &#x2013; for instance between enhancer and promoters [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], CTCF [<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or those mediated by protein bridges [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] &#x2013; define transient genomic regions that can be effectively be thought of as looped. We envisage that the SMC-localisation mechanism would thus localise entanglements that become transiently trapped within these looped regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1d"><title>A model for SMC-recruited TopoII</title>
<p>Having shown that SMC complexes can induce the <italic>localisation</italic> of topological entanglements, we next asked whether SMC-mediated recruitment of TopoII could provide a fast and efficient mechanism for topological <italic>simplification</italic>.</p>
<p>To this end, and in contrast with previous works which approximated the action of TopoII via a uniform non-zero probability of strand-crossing events over the whole polymer contour [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], here we assume that TopoII is locally recruited by the SMC complex and that it is placed on the outside of the loop subtended by the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Thus, only the two nearest beads in front of the ones forming the SMC heads, i.e. <italic>h</italic><sub>1<italic>/</italic>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&#x00B1;</italic> 1, <italic>h</italic><sub>1<italic>/</italic>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&#x00B1;</italic> 2, were bound by TopoII and allowed to undergo strand-crossing events (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). To this end, we set their interaction with all other beads to be a soft repulsion <italic>U</italic><sub>Topo</sub> = <italic>A</italic> [1 &#x002B; cos (<italic>&#x03C0;r/r</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>)], where the energy barrier <italic>A</italic> was set to 20<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> for the bead closest to SMC and to 5<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> for the next-nearest bead (this was done to avoid numerical instabilities due to abrupt changes in the force field).</p>

(B) Implementation of (A) in a bead-spring polymer model: the SMC slip-link is enforced by a FENE bond between blue beads which are updated in time while TopoII action is modelled via soft repulsion of selected (green) beads with all other others bead, thus leading to possible strand crossing, see text).

<sec id="s1e"><title>Localisation of Topological Entanglements Catalyses TopoII-mediated Simplification</title>
<p>To see whether a synergistic mechanism coupling SMC extrusion to TopoII-mediated strand crossing could systematically simplify the substrate topology, we performed BD simulations initialised from equilibrated configurations containing a de-localised trefoil knot (3<sub>1</sub>) and loaded one SMC protein recruiting a TopoII enzyme, as discussed in the previous section (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We monitored the time evolution of the substrate topology by computing its instantaneous Alexander polynomial [<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] while tracking both the position of the SMC heads and the boundaries of the knotted region [<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Remarkably, in all the independent replicas of the system, the SMCTopoII complex was able to simplify the topology of the substrate down to the unknot.</p>
<p>Importantly, we observed that the topological simplification occurred only after the localisation of the knotted region by the SMC protein (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This can be explained by the argument that a localised knot breaks the symmetry between the region inside it and outside it along the polymer, so that intra-chain contacts are more likely to occur between segments forming the local knot than between any other two segments of the polymer. In turn, this localisation favours the undoing of essential crossings. In other words, knot (or link) localisation increases the local entropic pressure within a knotted region [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] which then promotes the knot (or link) simplification.</p>
<p>We stress that the observed systematic topological simplification is different from all existing alternative mechanisms accounting for the action of TopoII alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Our mechanism also works in the absence of high levels of supercoiling, which is known to provide another avenue to post-replicative decatenation [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] &#x2013; this is important as highly supercoiled conformations are not documented for eukaryotic chromatin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1f"><title>Synergistic Topological Simplification is Efficient also in Crowded and Confined Conditions</title>
<p>One of the major problems in elucidating how TopoIImediated topological simplification works <italic>in vivo</italic> is that it must somehow be able to &#x201C;recognise&#x201D; the global topology of the underlying DNA molecule while performing local strandcrossings. Hooked DNA juxtapositions between pre-bent segments may provide a simple read-out mechanism to simplify localised knots in dilute conditions [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, this is not a viable pathway in crowded or confined conditions such as those <italic>in vivo</italic> for at least two reasons: (i) in dense solutions many DNA-DNA juxtapositions will occur by random collision regardless of the local bending and (ii) knots and other forms of topological entanglement tend to de-localise under (isotropic) confinement [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this context we asked whether the synergistic mechanism proposed here may instead provide a robust pathway to carry out simplifications of genomic topologies under confinement, as required within the nucleus of cells.</p>
<p>To answer this question we performed simulations where several knots, ranging from the trefoil (3<sub>1</sub>) to the 9<sub>1</sub>, were confined within a sphere of radius <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, smaller than the typical size of the same polymer in equilibrium with a good solvent, &#x27E8;<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> &#x27E9;. Under confinement, knots are strongly delocalised [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), yet we discover that the synergistic action of SMC and TopoII can still efficiently simplify the substrate topology until it becomes eventually unknotted. As the SMC protein slides along the crumpled substrate, we observe configurations in which a third segment is found in front of the extruding fork can spontaneously occur (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These conformations are reminiscent of hooked juxtapositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] that are here due to the linear reeling of the substrate through the SMC slip-link. These findings also suggest that the recruitment of TopoII in front of the extruding motion of the SMC [<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], may have been evolved as an optimal strategy to resolve topological entanglements which may cause DNA damage if unresolved.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3:</label>

<p>We highlight that a mechanism that can achieve topology simplification under confinement has never been proposed before. In marked contrast with existing models, our simulations even suggest that SMC-driven simplification may be more efficient under stronger confinement (see SI). This can be explained as the entropic penalty for forming a loop of size <italic>l</italic> by the SMC complex is smaller on a crumpled substrate than on an unconfined, and thus swollen, one [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For this reason, the extruding action of the SMC complex is less hindered under confinement and the localisation of the knot is achieved more quickly (see SI, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst the action of a single SMC always led to the localisation of both a knot and its essential crossing, this was no longer the case when we accounted for the simultaneous (and parallel) action of multiple SMC. Indeed, we observed that the extrusion of non-nested loops may stabilise a de-localised knot whose essential crossings are localised (see SI). This mixed state is akin to that recently observed during the translocation of knotted DNA through nanopores [<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and will be further investigated in the future.</p>

<sec id="s1g"><title>Comparison of the Synergistic Versus Random Passage and Hooked Juxtaposition Models</title>
<p>To compare the efficiency of the synergistic simplification mechanism proposed here with previous models of TopoIImediated action, we estimated the transition probabilities within the space of knots [<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], <italic>&#x03C1;</italic>(&#x1D4A6;<sub>1</sub> &#x2192; &#x1D4A6;<sub>2</sub>) by performing 50 simulations starting from equilibrated polymers tied in the form of knots ranging from 3<sub>1</sub> to 7<sub>2</sub>. The transition probabilities are reported in Table TI, both for unconstrained and confined polymers, and are compared with those reported by random passage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] (RP) and hooked juxtaposition [<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] (HJ) models.</p>
<p>Whereas in RP and HJ models the transition probabilities are computed from a set of equilibrium polymer conformations, our transition probabilities are non-equilibrium ones. Indeed, our model has an absorbing state which is attained when the SMC has extruded the full polymer and simplified its topology down to the unknot. In this state, because the remaining polymer segments are no longer able to cross eachother, the topology is locked in the trivial one at all future times. The values reported in table TI for <italic>&#x03C1;</italic>(&#x1D4A6;<sub>1</sub> &#x2192; &#x1D4A6;<sub>2</sub>) should thus be understood as the (asymmetric) probability that, starting from a polymer with given topology &#x1D4A6;<sub>1</sub>, the next topology attained by the polymer is &#x1D4A6;<sub>2</sub>. In this sense, our transition rates can be compared with the ones reported for the RP and HJ models. Unlike these and other models, ours predicts a virtually systematic simplification cascade down to the unknot in both free and confined conditions, such as are found in the cell nucleus.</p>

<sec id="s1h"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this work, we have provided numerical evidence for a new molecular mechanism that can efficiently maintain the genomes free of entanglements. This is based on the combined action of SMC-driven extrusion and TopoII-mediated strand-crossing. More specifically we found that the sliding of molecular hand-cuffs along knotted or linked substrates naturally generates highly localised entanglements which catalyse their simplification through the action of TopoII. Importantly, the envisaged mechanism is universal, in that it works equally well on DNA or chromatin, open or circular substrates, interphase and mitosis (in eukaryotes) and across all life forms that have evolved TopoII-like and SMC-like proteins.</p>
<p>Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for existing evidence suggesting that the presence of both SMC condensin and TopoII, is required to ensure correct decatenation of sister chromatids [<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>-<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and that inactivation of SMC leads to an increase in entanglement complexity and sister chromatids intertwining [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our model, SMC-driven knot and link localisation is indeed an essential step to avoid the creation of more complicated knots and links which may occur under the extreme packing typically achieved in mitosis.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to highlight that recent experiments reported that in absence of TopoII, DNA damage is accumulated in front of cohesin complexes [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This finding is in agreement with the principle revealed by our model, i.e. that the sliding motion of SMC entraps topological entanglements and, in turn, accumulates local stress promoting DNA breaks. In this respect, we argue that our results provide compelling mechanistic evidence that there is an evolutionary advantage for TopoII proteins to be actively recruited by SMC complexes since this process contributes to release the accumulated stress during the dynamic formation of looped domains [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>An analogous mechanism to that uncovered here may work to efficiently eliminate entanglements during DNA replication. Here, two replication forks moving along opposite directions along the genome (or reeling it in) effectively extrude a DNA or chromatin loop [<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The polymerising machinery at the fork then effectively functions as a SMC, driving the localisation of entanglements ahead of the growing loop. As TopoII is known to act in front of the replication fork [<xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the very same synergistic mechanism for topological simplification proposed here may be at play in this context as well. It is also of interest to note that PCNA, the molecular clamp associated with a processive polymerase [<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], also recruits components of repair complexes, which would again be evolutionary advantageous to resolve entanglement-related DNA damage. All these considerations reinforce the idea that the mechanism we propose may be universal.</p>
<p>Whilst we assumed for simplicity that SMC moves unidirectionally, due to either an intrinsic motor activity or a motor pushing it from behind, we expect that similar physics should be at work for diffusively sliding SMC complexes, provided that entropic considerations favour loop enlargement. This will be the case if SMC is loaded at particular sites, as this creates a positively biasing osmotic pressure [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], or when multiple slip-links are simultaneously present, as the entropy is generically maximised when some of the loops shrink to zero [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
<p>We finally speculate that the remarkable low knotting probability recently quantified in intracellular chromatin and its weak or absent scaling with the length of the substrate [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] may be explained by the model proposed in this work: indeed, the SMC-TopoII synergistic topological simplification is remarkably insensitive to substrate length (see SI) since TopoII is always recruited to act on a localised knot or entanglement.</p>
<p>We hope that, based on the evidence reported here, new experimental effort will identify and further characterise this novel synergistic mechanism to regulate genome topology. For instance, we envisage that it may be tested <italic>in vivo</italic> by combining the action of TopoII and functional SMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> by quantifying chromatin knotting [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] after knockdown of SMC rather than TopoII.</p>

<p>We model a polymer substrate, such as DNA or chromatin, as a chain of beads of size <italic>&#x03C3;</italic> connected by springs. This types of models are widely employed in the literature and have been shown to faithfully capture the physical behaviour of DNA and chromatin [28, 37, 64, 65]. To ensure that the polymer substrates does not cross through itself, we impose that any two beads (<italic>a, b</italic>) at distance <italic>r</italic> are subject to a purely repulsive (WCA) potential</p>

<sec id="s2a2"><title>A Model for Structural Maintenance of Chromosome Proteins</title>
<p>The SMC proteins &#x2013; such as cohesins and condensins &#x2013; are a well-known and widely studied family of proteins [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] that have now been identified as responsible for dynamic genomic loops in both interand meta-phase [26, 67]. These proteins can be crudely viewed as physical slip-links [<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] that embrace one, or two, double-stranded DNA and slide along DNA/chromatin [23, 24] in turn stabilising the formation of dynamic loops [22, 24] and halting at &#x201C;anchor&#x201D; points embodied by converging CTCF proteins [26, 49]. In this work, we aim to mechanistically investigate the generic effect of SMC proteins on topological entanglements &#x2013; such as knots and links &#x2013; that may be present on DNA or chromatin in interphase and mitosis. To this end, we propose a generic model where SMC proteins loaded on the polymer are described as bonds connecting two non-consecutive beads along the chain. Importantly, and in marked contrast with recent models of loop extrusion [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], here we account for the physical presence of a slip-link-like molecule joining two segments of chromosomes by forcing the maximum extension of the bond with a FENE potential so that it is energetically very unfavourable for a third bead to cross through the gap in between the joined segments. Again, this is done to prevent spontaneous events that would change the local topology of the substrate and that are not physically possible in real situations. It is worth noting that this detail has not been correctly accounted for in some of the existing models of loop extrusion [22, 37]. In other words, the SMC protein is modelled by including a potential</p>

<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="410019_eqnA4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub> are the instantaneous position of the two segments of chromosome bound by the SMC protein at time <italic>t</italic> (or the SMC &#x201C;heads&#x201D;). At rate <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="410019_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (<italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> <italic>=&#x03C3;</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/D</italic> is the Brownian time of a bead, see below), we change the position of the heads via the following protocol:
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="410019_eqnA5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>In other words, the SMC enlarges the loop formed by two monomers on average every 1000 Brownian times only if the distance between the next pair of beads is shorter than 1.3<italic>&#x03C3;</italic> in 3D space. This choice ensures that no third bead can pass through the beads bonded by the SMC protein and it effectively slows down the processivity of the complex from <italic>v</italic> = 2<italic>&#x03C3;&#x03BA;</italic> = 2 10<sup><italic>-3&#x03C3;/&#x03C4;</italic></sup><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> to about <italic>v &#x2243;</italic>5 10<sup><italic>-</italic>5</sup><italic>&#x03C3;/&#x03C4;</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>. Yet, we stress that the speed of the extrusion (or diffusion) process does not affect the efficiency of the synergistic mechanism we uncover in this work.</p>

<p>Given the size of a bead <italic>&#x03C3;</italic> and the energy scale <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> (at room temperature), we can derive the typical (Brownian) time taken for a bead to diffuse its own size as <italic>&#x03C4;</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> = <italic>&#x03C3;</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/D</italic> = 3<italic>&#x03C0;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;</italic><sup>3</sup><italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>.

<p>In contrast to previous works which crudely model the action of TopoII as a uniform non-zero probability of strandcrossing events [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], here we assume that TopoII is locally recruited by the SMC protein and it is loaded on the outside of the loop subtended by the complex. Thus, here only the two beads (about 60 nm) in front of the ones forming the SMC complex &#x2013; i.e. if <italic>h</italic><sub>1,2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) are the positions of the SMC heads then (<italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x002B; 1, <italic>h</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x002B; 2) and (<italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>-</italic>1, <italic>h</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>-</italic>2) are the beads associated to TopoII &#x2013; are allowed to undergo strand-crossing events.

<p>To avoid numerical instabilities which may occur due to the dynamic update of the SMC heads, we tune <italic>A</italic> so that it displays an increasing energy gradient, i.e. the furthest bead from the SMC complex is set to have <italic>A</italic> = 5<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic> while the closer one <italic>A</italic> = 20<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>.

<sec id="s2b"><title>Appendix B: Localisation Efficiency as a function of Number of SMC</title>
<p>It is reasonable to ask whether the synergistic effect we uncover in this work may be made more efficient by considering multiple SMC extruding loops on the same substrate. To answer this question we perform simulations in which we simultaneously load 1, 2 and 4 SMC complexes at a random position along a polymer which is tied in a trefoil knot. The interaction between SMC heads is here considered mutually exclusive, i.e. if two SMC heads are found on consecutive beads and moving in opposite directions they remain still as cannot overlap on the same bead. In these simulations we discover two seemingly counter-intuitive effects:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the knots which become localised do so in shorter time when multiple SMC are loaded (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S S1A</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the probability to find a localised knot (here practically defined as one made by less than 50 beads) at large times decreases with the number of SMC (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S S1B</xref>);</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The former finding can be readily explained by the fact that multiple SMC can extrude more contour length on the same unit of time. Yet, the decrease in localisation probability is more puzzling.</p>
<p>By close inspection of the simulation trajectories we discover that this reduction in localisation probability is due to situations in which two or more SMC proteins are simultaneously loaded within and outside a knotted region. These situations may lead to trapped conformations that stabilise a delocalised knotted state (see kymograph and snapshots <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). On the contrary, a single SMC, even if loaded within a knotted region can turn the knot &#x201C;inside-out&#x201D; and ultimately generate a fully localised knot.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c"><title>Appendix C: Synergistic Unknotting is Favoured Under Confinement</title>
<p>As mentioned in the main text, we find that the proposed synergistic mechanism between SMC and TopoII can simplify knots even under strong confinement. Because of this, we argue that this pathway may be at work in vivo. Here, we further characterise this finding by quantifying the rate of knot localisation as a function of confinement. To this end, we perform different sets of 40 independent simulations in which a trefoil knot tied along a <italic>N</italic> = 300 beads polymer is confined within a sphere of varying radius <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and subject to the action of a single SMC. We consider a range of values for <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> ranging from tight confinement <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 10<italic>&#x03C3; &#x2243;&#x27E8;R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> <italic>&#x27E9;/</italic>3 to <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 50<italic>&#x03C3; &#x003E; &#x27E8;R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> <italic>&#x27E9;</italic>, where &#x27E8;<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> <italic>&#x27E9;</italic> is the typical size of the polymer in equilibrium in good solvent and under no confinement.</p>
<p>Remarkably, we discover that the typical localisation time (here practically defined as the first time at which the shortest knotted arc spans less than 50 beads) is shorter the stronger is the confinement (see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). We argue that this puzzling finding can be explained by the following argument: the entropic penalty associated with the formation of a loop of length <italic>l</italic> is <italic>S/k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> <italic>&#x223C;c</italic> log <italic>l</italic> where <italic>c</italic> is the exponent determining the decay of the contact probability <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>(<italic>l</italic>) <italic>&#x223C;l</italic><sup><italic>-c</italic></sup>. For a crumpled polymer, i.e. the conformation assumed under confinement, the contact exponent <italic>c</italic> = <italic>vd</italic> = 1, whereas for a swollen coil in good solvent (self-avoiding), <italic>c &#x2243;</italic>2.1 [<xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. For this reason, the entropic penalty grows more steeply for a swollen coil than for a crumpled globule. In turn, this implies that the loop extruding action of the SMC protein is entropically favoured (or less hindered) under confinement, in qualitative agreement with our findings (see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d"><title>Appendix D: Synergistic Unknotting as a Function of Substrate Length</title>
<p>In this section we provide a more quantitative, albeit not definitive, examination of efficiency of the proposed synergistic simplification as a function of the length of the substrate. Because of the largely fluctuating 3D conformations assumed by long polymers, the random passage and hooked juxtaposition models are known to be sensitive on this parameter [<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. To compare these models with the one proposed here, we perform 4 sets of 50 independent simulations starting from an equilibrated (and unconfined) polymer tied as a 7<sub>1</sub> knot with varying length <italic>M</italic>, ranging from 300 to 2000. If one takes <italic>&#x03C3;</italic> = 2.5 nm as the diameter of DNA, then this range compares to 750 <italic>-</italic>5000 bp. In Table T S1 we report the values of the transitions <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> <italic>&#x27F6; k</italic><sub>2</sub> observed for these different lengths of the substrate.</p>
<p>As one can notice, we find that for <italic>M</italic> = 300 the 7<sub>1</sub> is taken to the unknot through 5<sub>1</sub> and 3<sub>1</sub> with probability 1 and this probability is only mildly, if at all, affected for longer substrates. We highlight that this finding is likely to due to the fact that TopoII strand-crossing occurs more likely in pre-localised topological entanglements, thus strongly biasing their simplification over their complication.</p>
<p>In other words, while the time to localise a knot increases on longer substrates, the simplification cascade towards the unknot is virtually unaffected. In light of this insensitivity, we reason that if this mechanism was at work in vivo, then the knot probability in intracellular chromatin should not depend on the length of the fibre under consideration (because the efficiency to remove entanglements is the same no matter its length). Intriguingly, this picture is in remarkable agreement with recent experimental findings [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

(B) Probability to find a localised knot at large times as a function of the number of SMC proteins simultaneously loaded on the substrate. (C) Kymograph of a simulation for a polymer tied in a trefoil knot and with 2 SMC loaded at time <italic>t</italic> = 0. The shortest arc that can be defined knotted (after suitable closure [<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) is shaded in grey. The 4 SMC heads are shown in shades of blue. One of the two SMC is loaded within the knotted region at time <italic>t</italic> = 0, whereas the other is outside it. Eventually, heads belonging to different SMC meet and stall, thereby stabilising a delocalised knot. (D) Snapshot from the same simulation used to generate (C) and showing extruded segments in light grey and the polymer backbone in dark grey. One can see that essential crossings are localised (inset). (E) Snapshot highlighting the shortest arc that can be defined knotted in blue, while the rest of the polymer is showed in dark grey. These snapshots shows that even if essential crossings are localised, the knot itself need not be. This conformation has been recently found in simulations of translocation of knotted DNA [<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). See Supplementary Movie M6.</p></caption>
