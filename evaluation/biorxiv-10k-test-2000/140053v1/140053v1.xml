<title>Abstract</title>
<p>At synapses throughout the mammalian brain, AMPA receptors form complexes with auxiliary proteins, including TARPs. However, how TARPs modulate AMPA receptor gating remains poorly understood. We built structural models of TARP-AMPA receptor complexes for TARPs &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8, combining recent structural studies and de novo structure predictions. These models, combined with peptide binding assays, provide evidence for multiple interactions between GluA2 and variable extracellular loops of TARPs. Substitutions and deletions of these loops had surprisingly rich effects on the kinetics of glutamate-activated currents, without any effect on assembly. Critically, by altering the two interacting loops of &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8, we could entirely remove all allosteric modulation of GluA2, without affecting formation of AMPA receptor-TARP complexes. Likewise, substitutions in the linker domains of GluA2 completely removed any effect of TARPs on receptor kinetics, indicating a dominant role for this previously overlooked site proximal to the AMPA receptor channel gate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the identification of the protein Stargazin, also known as &#x03B3;2, as the prototype transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein (TARP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), a broad family of auxiliary proteins for the AMPA receptor have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). These proteins play an essential role in tethering AMPA-type glutamate receptors at the synapse, and also exert complex control over surface expression of functional receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Auxiliary proteins regulate the function of AMPA receptors, with both positive and negative modulation of gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), as well as control over permeation and block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The range of auxiliary subunit influence over synaptic transmission is compounded by striking regional and cell-type specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and a patchwork of interaction patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>TARPs and other auxiliary proteins modify the gating and pharmacology of synaptic AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The physiological importance of modulation is likely to be the specialization of particular codes of short-term plasticity, in the hippocampus and cerebellum at least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Recently, antagonists of AMPA receptors that target GluA2&#x2013;&#x03B3;8 complexes were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), further enhancing interest in the molecular basis of complexes of GluA subunits and their auxiliary proteins as potential drug targets.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that some of the effects of auxiliary proteins on receptor gating were due to the extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). However, several of these studies made use of chimeras with &#x03B3;5, which was presumed to be a null subunit, but which was subsequently shown to modulate gating and conductance of GluA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Although some mutations in extracellular portions of TARPs were reported that affect TARP activity, there is no clear indication that these TARPs formed complexes with GluA subunits as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). On the other hand, some studies of assembly made use of functional tests to assess the strength of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Given the variable stoichiometry of assembly between different TARP isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), interpreting these data, which combine the strength of association, expression and modulation into a single metric, is difficult. Very recently, a chimeric approach confirmed impressions from structural studies that transmembrane interactions are important for proper assembly, with the TM3 and TM4 segments of &#x03B3;2 and the M1-M3 helices of the AMPA receptor determining complex assembly. However, the C-termini of both the AMPA receptor and TARPs also appear to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Despite these insights, there is very little information about the extent to which different domains contribute to gating of complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and no information about the structural basis of slow modulation, superactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>Two of the predominant TARPs in the brain are the auxiliary proteins &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8. In this work, we isolate the extracellular segments of &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 that are responsible for modulation of gating, and show that these segments act on the receptor via the linkers connecting the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD). In so doing, we were able to produce &#x201C;null&#x201D; TARPs, which assemble normally but show no modulation of gating. Hereby, we establish mechanisms for the subunit specific modulation of AMPA receptors by auxiliary proteins.</p>

<title>A model of auxiliary protein interactions</title>
<p>Previous studies of TARP modulation of AMPA receptors have identified extracellular regions as potential interaction motifs. Crystal structures of Claudins, proteins with close homology to TARPs, enabled a more refined view, defining a folded extracellular &#x201C;cap&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) that substantially limits the sections of the extracellular portion of TARPs that are able to interact with the AMPA receptor, and therefore the likely range of these interactions. More recently, CryoEM micrographs of GluA2-TARP complexes allowed unambiguous positioning of TARPs at the periphery of the GluA2 pore, and partially resolved the extracellular domains of TARPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The major sequence and structural differences between Claudin and TARP proteins, and between TARPs with different modulatory effects, are found in the variable extracellular loops between &#x03B2;1 and &#x03B2;2 (Loop 1), and between TM3 and &#x03B2;5 (Loop 2). We sought to identify interactions between TARPs and the extracellular regions of the GluA2 receptor on this basis.</p>
<p>To understand the scope of TARP interactions with the AMPA receptor, we began by modeling the loops of &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 into a hybrid structure composed of Claudins and GluA2. Comparing these hybrid complexes to CryoEM electron density maps suggested that a range of interaction sites with the LBD-TMD linkers and D2 domains of the LBD are possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1A</xref>). Whereas TARP loop 2 (L2) engages in the receptors pore four-fold symmetry, loop 1 (L1) reaches up to the two-fold symmetry of the LBD layer. In other words, while L2 can interact four times in the same way with the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1B</xref>), L1 has at least two distinct modes of interaction depending on to which receptor subunits the TARP is adjacent (subunit A-D and B-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, or A-B and C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1A</xref>). The variable loop 1 is not resolved in structures to date, consistent with it being a flexible modulatory element. Superactivation of GluA2 receptors resembles strongly the slow modulation of AMPA receptors by particular allosteric modulators that bind at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We reasoned that extracellular loop interactions that stabilized the superactive state could preferentially target the GluA2 LBD dimer. To test this hypothesis, we composed an overlapping library of hexameric peptides based on extracellular sections of TARPs, targeting the long loop 1 of &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8, and other potential interacting sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the active dimer of LBDs ought to be intact for superactivation, we compared the interactions of our peptide library between the GluA2 LBD (flip form) and LBDs harboring the L483Y substitution, which greatly increases dimer formation in solution.</p>

<p>Repeated peptide mapping array assays indicated no clear preference for either monomeric or dimeric GluA2 LBD. However, in accordance with our hypothesis the majority of the L1 of both &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 contain hits in the peptide mapping array, indicating direct interaction with the receptor LBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and C</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1C</xref>), albeit in conditions lacking the usual steric constraints of the complex. In the recent cryo-EM structures of the GluA2-TARP complex a possible interaction between a conserved negatively charged region located on the TARP &#x03B2;4-TM2 loop and the KGK motif in the lower lobe of the GluA2 LBD was predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Thus we also tested for this potential interaction in the peptide mapping array but found no hits. A functional test of removing the acidic residues in this patch made &#x03B3;2 into a much stronger modulator of AMPAR gating, with the steady-state current and superactivation both doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggested that if interactions of the acidic patch with the receptor alter function, they actually inhibit the action of &#x03B3;2. However, other sites have a dominant effect in the positive modulation of gating.</p>
<p>We also tested L2 of &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 for possible interactions with the LBDs because of its conserved charged features (4 and 7 charges), which are less prominent in &#x03B3;5 and &#x03B3;7 (3 and 1 charges respectively). Considering L2 being positioned distant underneath the LBD (around 15&#x00C5;, measured between C&#x03B1; of GluA2 P717 and &#x03B3;2 K170 in the complex from PDB code: 5kbu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) in the cryo-EM structures, it was not surprising that we found no interaction between L2 peptides and the GluA2 LBD. According to our GluA2-TARP models, in both &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 L2 is positioned between the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which are outside the realms of our GluA2 LBD construct.</p>

<title>Modulation of fast AMPA receptor gating by TARP L1 and L2 segments</title>
<p>To investigate the role of the extracellular domain of TARPs in controlling AMPA receptor activation, we made a series of chimeras and deletion mutants between &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8. We first targeted the long loop in the first extracellular segment L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that has markedly different lengths and sequence content across the TARP family and its homologs. We also investigated the role of the shorter unstructured region in the second extracellular segment L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which is poised to interact with the LBD-TMD linkers of the AMPA receptor.</p>
<p>We first swapped L1 between &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 3</xref>), and assessed effects on desensitization. Although &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 apparently affect AMPA receptor desensitization similarly, &#x03B3;8 slows down entry to desensitization more than &#x03B3;2 (60 &#x00B1; 5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 40 &#x00B1; 5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 24 and 9, for &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These chimeras exhibited asymmetric effects on desensitization. When activated by 10 mM glutamate, the chimera of &#x03B3;2 with L1 from &#x03B3;8 had steady-state current of 50 &#x00B1; 5 &#x0025; (<italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), twice as large as &#x03B3;2 alone (25 &#x00B1; 2 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 24 patches), and the rate of entry to desensitization was approximately halved (35 &#x00B1; 5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the &#x03B3;8 chimera with L1 from &#x03B3;2 maintained the original desensitization behavior of the parent TARP (45 &#x00B1; 1 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Deletion of L1 from &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 approximately halved the steady state current (15 &#x00B1; 2 and 15 &#x00B1; 3 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 11 and 15, for &#x03B3;2 &#x0394;L1 and &#x03B3;8 &#x0394;L1, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), with a barely detectable speeding up of entry to desensitization (60 &#x00B1; 5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 11 and 15, for &#x03B3;2 &#x0394;L1 and &#x03B3;8 &#x0394;L1, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggested that L1 can influence desensitization of complexes, as shown recently for GSG1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) but the absence of a simple exchange in desensitization behavior suggested that this loop functions in concert with other modulatory elements.</p>

<p>Seeking a further explanation for the modulation of desensitization by TARPs, we investigated the effects of altering the 8-residue stretch in the second extracellular segment of TARPs (L2), which connects TM3 to &#x03B2;5 in the extracellular domain. Replacement of the L2 segment with a flexible Gly-Ser linker, predicted to be of sufficient length not to disrupt the overall structure of the extracellular domain, had a striking effect on &#x03B3;2. The rate of entry to desensitization was still slower than in receptors formed of GluA2 wild type (WT) alone (65 &#x00B1; 5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 120 &#x00B1; 15 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 15 and 9 patches for A2 &#x002B; &#x03B3;2 L2&#x005F;GS and A2 WT, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), but the steady state current was reduced to the level of receptors without any TARP present (5 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025; and 5 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 15 and 9 for A2 &#x002B; &#x03B3;2 L2&#x005F;GS and A2 WT, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Even more striking were results of coexpression of a chimera of &#x03B3;2 with the GS-linker replacing L2, but harboring the long L1 loop of &#x03B3;8. This chimera massively slowed entry to desensitization, producing complexes about 10-fold slower than receptors without any TARP (<italic>k</italic><sub>des</sub> &#x003D; 10 &#x00B1; 0.5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and increased the steady state current during a 500 ms pulse of glutamate (45 &#x00B1; 3&#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Making the inverse chimera (L1 from &#x03B3;2 in &#x03B3;8, with the GS-linker replacing L2) effectively nullified the modulatory activity of &#x03B3;8.</p>
<p>The steady-state current was the same magnitude as for receptors that did not have &#x03B3;8 (5 &#x00B1; 1&#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and the rate of entry to desensitization (85 &#x00B1; 20 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) was closer to that of wild-type GluA2 than for the &#x03B3;2 L2&#x005F;GS chimera (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we performed all measurements at &#x002B;50 mV, isolating heavily TARPed receptors by selecting for complexes with strong relief of polyamine block, we were concerned that some of the effects that we saw (particularly reduced or absent modulation) could be due to an altered stoichiometry of complexes, perhaps due to poor chimera expression. To assess this possibility, we measured the G-V relations for all the chimeras and deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 2 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, all mutants gave responses that were strongly reduced in rectification, indicating that complex formation was normal. Broadly, each chimera closely followed the polyamine relief induced by the parent TARP, with &#x03B3;2 chimeras producing populations of receptors that exhibited a greater rectification index than those based on &#x03B3;8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 2 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Superactivation of AMPA-TARP complexes</title>
<p>TARPs induce a subtype-specific superactivation of the GluA2 homomeric receptor. &#x03B3;8 is a much stronger modifier of this slow gating mode than &#x03B3;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We investigated the role of the extracellular domain in superactivation using the same set of TARP mutants, but using 7-second applications of glutamate to measure the equilibrium level reached following superactivation. Our hypothesis was that the difference in superactivation between &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 would be specified by the sequence element most divergent between these two TARPs, L1.</p>
<p>In the chimeras swapping loop 1 between &#x03B3;8 and &#x03B3;2, the results were asymmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). That is, loop 1 from &#x03B3;8 could transfer the same degree of superactivation to &#x03B3;2 (L1 &#x03B3;8 in &#x03B3;2, 27 &#x00B1; 6 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) but the reverse swap could not reduce superactivation to the level of &#x03B3;2 (L1 &#x03B3;2 in &#x03B3;8, 16 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The reason for this asymmetry became clear when we recorded complexes from which we removed L1 altogether from each TARP residual superactivation of 6 &#x00B1; 2 and 16 &#x00B1; 3&#x0025; (for &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8, respectively, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 6; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were still present in the absence of L1. Therefore, although loop 1 can contribute to superactivation, and increase it over baseline levels, it is not the only element of TARPs driving this effect.</p>

<p>Even more strikingly, the same TARP mutants with loop 1 swapped had a further reduced effect. The loop 1 from &#x03B3;2 in the L2&#x005F;GS mutant of &#x03B3;8 had almost negligible superactivation, reduced by &#x007E;15-fold from wild-type &#x03B3;8, to about 1 &#x00B1; 0.7 &#x0025; (<italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Taking into account the lack of steady-state current, fast desensitization and similar deactivation kinetics to wild-type GluA2 alone that we observed in patches containing complexes of GluA2 with the L1 &#x03B3;2 in &#x03B3;8 L2&#x005F;GS mutant, we classed this chimera as a kinetic null of &#x03B3;8.</p>
<p>The TARP chimeras that exhibited the least power to slow desensitization kinetics and to stabilize active states were those that replaced charged residues in the L2 segment, and from which we either deleted L1, or included the short loop from &#x03B3;2. These observations guided our construction of a kinetically-null &#x03B3;2. We reasoned that a &#x03B3;2 chimera lacking L1 and with a GS-linker replacing L2 should associate normally with GluA2 but might have no kinetic effect at all on the receptor complexes. Indeed, &#x03B3;2 &#x0394;L1 L2&#x005F;GS associated normally into the receptor complex (as assessed by relief of polyamine block, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A and B</xref>) but this mutant &#x03B3;2 was highly deficient in modulating gating of GluA2.

<title>L2 controls gating through interaction with linkers proximal to the channel gate</title>
<p>From our models, a range of sites on GluA2 could interact with L1, including the KGK motif in the LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Substitutions at L2 of &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 had profound effects on gating of TARP complexes and are well placed to interact with gating machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1B</xref>). Particularly, we expected from our structural models and other available structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) that L2 should interact with the S1-M1 linker and the S2-M4 linker in the AMPA receptor. The L2 sequence has an alternating charge motif that is mirrored in two parts of the GluA2 linkers 508&#x2013;510 and 781&#x2013;783. These segments are immediately adjacent to the TARP L2 in all four subunits.</p>
<p>Replacement of 508QKS510 to GAG in the S1-M1 linker (GluA2 508GAG510, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) produced a GluA2 receptor with normal kinetics and that associated normally with &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 7 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, in complexes with WT &#x03B3;2, this mutant phenocopied the neutralizing truncation of L2 in TARPs well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), abolishing superactivation and reducing the steady state current (0&#x0025; and 10 &#x00B1; 5&#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 3 and 4, for superactivation and <italic>I</italic><sub>ss</sub>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, a point mutant K509A, also with normal gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 7 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1</xref>), was more strongly modulated by &#x03B3;2, providing further indication that a second site was potentially involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Our model suggested that the S2-M4 linker of GluA2 was equally well positioned to interact with L2 from &#x03B3;2. To test the importance of the alternating charges in the S2-M4 linker, we made another triple mutation replacing 781KEK783 to GSG (GluA2 781GSG783, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This mutant again had normal kinetics in the absence of &#x03B3;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 7 &#x2013; Figure supplement 1</xref>), but also exhibited a reduced steady state current and negligible superactivation (10 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025; and 2 &#x00B1; 0.5&#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 9 and 8, for I<sub>ss</sub> and superactivation respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, the combination of these two triple mutants, abolished the entire modulatory effect of &#x03B3;2 on the AMPA receptor, reducing superactivation and the instantaneous steady-state current to the same level as GluA2 in the absence of TARP (0 &#x0025; and 5 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 4 and 8, for superactivation and <italic>I</italic><sub>ss</sub>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

<p>To discern whether the loss of modulation occurred because the linker sites are the primary interaction site, or whether the linkers both interact with TARPs and transmit upstream modulation from sites in the LBD, we assessed modulation by &#x03B3;8 and related chimeras.

Given this result, which suggested that L1 could still modulate gating of complexes, we hypothesized that the &#x03B3;2 chimera incorporating the L1 of &#x03B3;8 should also modulate the double linker mutant. This chimera could not produce superactivating complexes (2 &#x00B1; 2 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D and E</xref>, as for the &#x03B3;2 chimera lacking L2 interactions, L1 &#x03B3;8 in &#x03B3;2 L2&#x005F;GS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) but retained the slow desensitizing behavior due to L1 (<italic>k</italic><sub>des</sub> &#x003D; 12 &#x00B1; 0.5, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In coherence with our previous results, mutation of the GluA2 linkers ablated the effect of the &#x03B3;8 chimera with L1 from &#x03B3;2 to modulate the kinetics of complexes, reducing the steady state current and superactivation to the same levels as GluA2 wild-type in the absence of TARP (I<sub>ss</sub> &#x003D; 4 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025;, superactivation &#x003D; 1 &#x00B1; 1 &#x0025;, <italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 5 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of the long L1, &#x03B3;8 fails to modulate GluA2 when the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linker interaction sites are removed (again consistent with its cousin lacking L2 interaction sites, the L1 &#x03B3;2 in &#x03B3;8 L2&#x005F;GS variant; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these results indicate that the long loop of &#x03B3;8 L1 is still able to modulate complexes at extracellular sites with the receptor linker sites disrupted, supporting the idea that the linkers do not function primarily to transduce distant TARP modulation. Rather, the LBD-TMD linkers are the primary modulatory site for both &#x03B3;8 and &#x03B3;2. The latter has a short L1 loop, and cannot modulate receptors if the L2 interaction is absent. However, &#x03B3;8 combines the longer L1 and the L2 site to modulate receptor properties more effectively, in a compound fashion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results we present here offer several new insights into TARP function. First of all, extracellular sites account for all the modification of AMPA receptor gating by TARPs. Previous work showed that L1 could transfer aspects of modulation between TARPs, but our experiments indicate that the 2nd short extracellular segment (L2), which varies strongly in sequence between TARPs, is dominant. Further work will be required to establish the generality of this modulatory mechanism.</p>
<p>Secondly, these same sites do not have any appreciable role in determining assembly of TARP-AMPA receptor complexes. Intuitively, this division of roles makes sense because gating modification requires transient interactions on a timescale far faster than receptor assembly. Therefore, interactions between transmembrane segments and intracellular regions are responsible for assembly and modulation of polyamine block.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we show that the linkers to the transmembrane domain are key sites for modulation of AMPA receptor gating by auxiliary proteins, and provide insights into the molecular basis of this interaction. Previous work suggested ATD interactions and prominent roles for the LBD in modulation, but the interactions we demonstrate here are much more proximal to the channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We could show a very close functional confluence between modifying the receptor itself and modifying each TARP, at an interaction site predicted from structural modeling. The elimination of modulation by nullifying L2 of &#x03B3;2, or by mutating residues in the LBD-TMD linkers of GluA2, strongly implicates this site as a pivotal interaction underlying modulation. Putative electrostatic interactions posited from structural studies require a large conformational change (between 13 &#x00C5; and 25 &#x00C5; depending on the TARP&#x2019;s position in the complex; measured between C-alpha atoms from GluA2 K699 and &#x03B3;2 D92 in cryo-EM complexes 5kbu and 5kk2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). A key point here is that these interactions are secondary to those involving L2 at the AMPAR linkers. These interactions should occur readily for each auxiliary protein subunit, allowing a maximal 4:4 stoichiometry with minimal conformational change for &#x03B3;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). For other auxiliary proteins, for example &#x03B3;8, the stoichiometry of the L2-linker interaction would vary with the number of associated TARPs, but will not be limited by position of the TARP within the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Finally, neutralization of the major part of the acidic patch strongly enhanced modulation of gating by &#x03B3;2, ruling out that negative charges here have a dominant role in modulation.</p>

The orientation of the more extensive loop 1 of &#x03B3;8 is not known, here it is depicted reaching up to the LBD dimer. <bold>C</bold>) Cartoon model of the proposed AMPA modulation mechanism, taking the example of &#x03B3;8. The AMPA-TARP complex is shown from top (upper panel) and in side view (lower panel). The receptor is colored in grey (pore forming M3 domain depicted in dark grey). &#x03B3;8 is colored as in panel B, with the acidic patch omitted. In the resting state (indicated by a red, closed pore) L2 is positioned in close proximity to the LBD-TMD connecting linkers. Once glutamate binds to the LBD, the resulting conformational change is transduced via the LBD-TMD linkers to open the pore (olive green, open state). During this transition L2 could wedge between the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linkers to modulate the receptor gating. The concerted action of L1 and L2 is necessary for superactivation of the receptor (dark green, high open probability state), most likely via L1 to stabilizing the LBDs layer.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Fourth, we show that the long extracellular loop 1 of &#x03B3;8 is a very strong positive modulator of AMPA receptor gating, whose influence is likely held in check by the substoichiometric combination of &#x03B3;8 with the AMPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The subunit &#x03B3;8 slows receptor desensitization via L1. This loop can produce a profound block of desensitization when transplanted to &#x03B3;2, and probably interacts state-specifically with the LBD dimer because of its substantial reach (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Previous kinetic measurements suggest that superactivation is adopted by a minor population of receptors in equilibrium with saturating glutamate, speaking in favor of a weak interaction that is boosted by the high effective concentration of L1 close to its site of action in the receptor complex.</p>
<p>Our approach to fit Claudins with modeled loops from TARPs into the best resolution cryoEM reconstruction available (5KK2, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>)) has clear implications for modulation. Our model, when compared to the independently derived model of TARP-AMPA modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), presents the TARPs oriented at a subtly different angle. Therefore, our model predicted the L2 interaction on the basis of one set of CryoEM data. We could not adequately incorporate the loops and the original structures of the receptor linkers in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1</xref>). Whilst this problem could be due to deficits in our model, another explanation is that the linkers (S1-M1 and S2-M4) are disrupted from their basal positions, and that the L2 loop can wedge between them. Upon activation, it is expected that the linkers will move away from the overall pore axis, which could permit further state-dependent interactions (See cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>Future structural studies may permit a more detailed view into the interactions between L2 and the linker domains of AMPAR. Although Claudin structures allowed positioning of auxiliary proteins with high confidence within CryoEM reconstructions, the loops that we have investigated here are not resolved within these structures, possibly because they interact transiently and are otherwise disordered. Although our peptide array suggested that stretches of L1 interact with the LBD, we were not able to obtain co-crystal structures of peptides with monomeric or dimeric forms of the GluA2 LBD. Nonetheless, knowledge of Claudin structures enabled us to make structurally sympathetic substitutions into TARPs for functional experiments that did not disrupt expression or assembly of complexes. These approaches are in contrast with most previous work which simply swapped extracellular portions, including mismatching the folded portions of the TARP extracellular domain. Two observations highlight the importance of sympathetic exchanges. First, some naive deletions would be expected to alter TARP structure. The simple deletion of L2 would severely disrupt the extracellular domain of &#x03B3;2 or &#x03B3;8, because this segment connects structured regions separated by about 10 &#x00C5;. Second, some deletion chimeras we made retained modulation, with the most striking example being &#x03B3;8 &#x0394;L1 L2&#x005F;GS, which retained a substantial steady state current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The residual modulation could be related to the presence of a few residues from L1 in the &#x03B3;8 &#x0394;L1 L2&#x005F;GS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 3</xref>). Without maintaining these residues, the chimera did not express. This observation illustrates the sensitivity of domain boundaries in TARPs.</p>
<p>Because our observations suggest that the AMPA receptor linkers are key to TARP modulation, it is likely that chimeric receptors with altered linkers that exhibit constitutive gating are bad reporters of the TARP-GluA modulation, although they clearly delineate assembly motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The molecular nature of the interactions we have identified here raise the intriguing possibility that acute disassembly of complexes, rather than modulation, might be the target of recent subtype specific drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results allow us to construct a tentative model for the distinct forms of modulation that TARPs produce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The slow increase in glutamate efficacy, which we term superactivation, is specified by the combination of L1 and L2, whereas the basal increase in steady state current arises from L2 alone. We previously modeled the modulatory interaction between TARPs and the AMPA receptor with single conformational change, but did not consider desensitization. The concerted involvement of multiple loops suggests multiple conformational states are required to describe the interaction, most notably in the case of &#x03B3;8. The greater conformational space that can be explored by loop 1, and its strong connection to superactivation, indicate that these conformational changes could relate to the slow transitions represented in the model of superactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In contrast, conformational changes of the linker region of the AMPA receptor upon opening will naturally lead to a state-dependent interaction with L2 of &#x03B3;2 or &#x03B3;8, because of the direct proximity. A further level of complexity is that an intact L2 segment is required for the strong superactivation induced by &#x03B3;8, but is not required at all for slow desensitization behavior that the long L1 loop of &#x03B3;8 can produce. Because in these experiments, slow desensitization occurs when occupancy of superactive states is low, we can quite reasonably assume that L1 adopts multiple conformations to stabilize separate functional states of the receptor, and that some functional signatures require a concerted action of both loops. Additional stabilization of desensitized states by the variable loop 1 is also likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>This work has produced mutant TARPs and AMPA receptors that both lack modulatory properties, and also those that have greatly enhanced modulation. Both these signatures of activity should be useful tools for investigating TARP action in synapses, including understanding the relative importance of assembly into complexes for anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) as opposed to kinetic modulation, for clarifying the consequences of TARP modulation for short term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and for better identifying TARPs in ternary complexes with other auxiliary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>

<p>Wild type or mutant GluA2 and TARP constructs were co-transfected in HEK 293 cells with PEI. The ratios of co-transfection were 1:2 for GluA2-&#x03B3;2 and 1:5 for GluA2-&#x03B3;8, up to 2 &#x03BC;g total DNA per 35 mm dish. The same ratios were maintained for all the reciprocal mutants. Cells were supplemented with 40 &#x03BC;M NBQX to reduce TARP-induced cytotoxicity. Recordings were performed 24&#x2013;48 hours after transfection. The external recording solution contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 0.1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.3 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 120 NaCl, 10 NaF, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 Na<sub>4</sub>BAPTA, 5 HEPES and 0.05 spermine, pH 7.3. 10 mM glutamate was applied to outside-out patches with a piezo-driven fast perfusion system (PI, Germany). In order to isolate currents exclusively mediated by TARPed receptors, patches were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of &#x002B;50 mV. Currents were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, U.S.A.) and acquired with Axograph X software (Axograph Scientific, U.S.A.). Typical 10&#x2013;90&#x0025; solution exchange times were faster than 300 &#x03BC;s, as measured from junction potentials at the open tip of the patch pipette.</p>
<p><italic>Data analysis</italic>. To measure receptor desensitization we applied 10 mM glutamate for 500 ms. Desensitization rate and steady-state current were then obtained by fitting the traces with a sum of two, and when necessary three, exponentials. Rates constants are expressed as weighted mean of multiple components. Superactivation was measured during a 7 second application of glutamate and was defined as the excess steady-state amplitude following the desensitization trough, normalized to the peak current. A triple exponential function was used to fit the slowly augmenting current of superactivation measurements. To account for possible variability in the response and expression of the complexes, we tried to record at least 5&#x2013;6 patches from at least three different transfections for each condition. For experiments with very low success rates (that is, worse than 1 patch in 20 giving an acceptable recording), in the presence of &#x03B3;8, at least three patches were collected. No data were excluded, except from patches where recordings were unstable, had excessive rundown or solution exchange slower than 0.5 ms as measured after the experiment. Results are shown as mean &#x00B1; standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) and statistical significance was assessed with a two-tailed Student&#x2019;s <italic>t</italic>-test as specified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

The spot array consisted of hexameric overlapping peptides shifted by one residue. Peptide spotted membranes were rinsed with ethanol for 5 minutes, following three times 10 min washing with TBS and incubation with blocking buffer (Casein Blocking buffer (Sigma B6429), 150 mM Saccharose, in TBS) for 3 hours at RT. The blocking buffer was removed by three wash steps with TBS before the membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x00B0;C with either 50 &#x03BC;g/ml protein (GluA2&#x005F;LBD or GluA2&#x005F;LBD&#x005F;LY) in blocking buffer or blocking buffer only for control.

Spot-signal intensities were measured in Boehringer Light Units (BLU) and the software GeneSpotter 2.6.0 (MicroDiscovery, Berlin, Germany) was applied for data processing. Hits from peptides located within &#x03B2;-sheets were taken to be false positives, because when isolated these peptides likely form unphysiological &#x03B2;-sheets in a nonspecific manner with existing structures in the GluA2 LBD.

<p>Initial &#x03B3;2 and &#x03B3;8 models were generated based on the crystal structure of claudin15 (PDB code: 4p79) using the SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and ProtMod server (part of the FFAS server, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Both models were incomplete (either lacking linker structures or failing to correctly trace transmembrane helix 3, TM3). Thus, we used COOT (version 0.8.7) to superpose the two generated models and to build the final model with an intact helix 3 and plausible extracellular loops 1 and 2. Superposing our final TARP models onto the &#x03B3;2 molecules present in the AMPA-TARP cryo-EM structure (PDB code: 5kk2) in PyMOL (v1.6.0.0) yielded in the AMPA-TARP complexes shown in our Figures. The different possible orientations of Loop 1 were modeled using COOT. Unfortunately the LBD to TMD connecting linkers (S1-TM1 and S2-TM4) are not resolved in the AMPA-TARP cryo-EM structure. To better understand the Loop 2 participation in AMPA receptor regulation we used the crystal structure of GluA2 (PDB code: 3kg2) with resolved linkers and superposed it onto the receptor of our AMPA-TARP complex model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 &#x2013; Figure supplement 2</xref>). As the side chains of the possible interacting residues (507-QKS-510, 781KSK-783) located in the LBD-TMD linkers were not resolved in 3kg2 we modeled the most likely side chain conformations of these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A and B</xref>).

L2 is sandwiched between the receptor linkers (S1-M1 and S2-M4) connecting the LBD to the pore-forming TMD. C) Sequences of the hexameric TARP peptides used in the peptide mapping array are listed according to their position in the array. Secondary structure elements are shown in the same color code as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and C</xref>.
