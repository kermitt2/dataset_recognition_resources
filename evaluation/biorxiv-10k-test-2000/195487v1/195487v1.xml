<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Condensins are broadly conserved chromosome organizers that function in chromatin compaction and transcriptional regulation, but to what extent these two functions are linked has remained unclear. Here, we analyzed the effect of condensin inactivation on genome compaction and global gene expression in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Spike-in-controlled 3C-seq analysis revealed that acute condensin inactivation leads to a global decrease in close-range chromosomal interactions as well as more specific losses of homotypic tRNA gene clustering. In addition, a condensin-rich topologically associated domain between the ribosomal DNA and the centromere on chromosome XII is lost upon condensin inactivation. Unexpectedly, these large-scale changes in chromosome architecture are not associated with global changes in transcript levels as determined by spike-in-controlled mRNA-seq analysis. Our data suggest that the global transcriptional program of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is resistant to condensin inactivation and the associated profound changes in genome organization.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Gene expression occurs in the context of higher-order chromatin organization, which helps compact the genome within the spatial constraints of the nucleus. To what extent higher-order chromatin compaction affects gene expression remains unknown. Here, we show that gene expression and genome compaction can be uncoupled in the single-celled model eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Inactivation of the conserved condensin complex, which also organizes the human genome, leads to broad genome decompaction in this organism. Unexpectedly, this reorganization has no immediate effect on the transcriptome. These findings indicate that the global gene expression program is robust to large-scale changes in genome architecture in yeast, shedding important new light on the evolution and function of genome organization in gene regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organized compaction of eukaryotic genomes regulates important nuclear processes including transcription, replication, and repair (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Classic examples of nuclear organization include compartmentalization of transcriptionally active and repressed domains, as well as specialized structures as in the segregation of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) into the nucleolus (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recent measurements of pairwise interaction frequencies between chromosomal sites revealed additional structural elements, including stable topologically associating domains (TAD) on the scale of 0.1-1Mb (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but also smaller more dynamic interaction domains linked to gene regulation (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Restriction of chromosomal interactions within TADs is thought to support enhancer-promoter specificity and is important for normal development (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolutionarily conserved condensins have emerged as major regulators of chromosomal architecture. Condensins belong to the <underline>s</underline>tructural <underline>m</underline>aintenance of <underline>c</underline>hromosomes (SMC) family of chromosome organizers, which also include cohesin and the SMC5/6 complex (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Like other SMC complexes, condensin forms a ring-like structure and topologically encircles DNA to mediate chromosomal looping (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Condensins are essential for chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division. In addition, condensin complexes regulate nuclear organization in interphase in a number of organisms (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Interphase activities include the organization of TADs on specific chromosomes or across the genome (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and regulating interchromosomal interactions. For example, condensin complexes control X chromosome organization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), chromosome pairing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and clustering of cell cycle-regulated genes in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In <italic>S cerevisiae</italic>, condensin is required for tethering the centromere of chromosome XII (ChrXII) to the rDNA, rDNA compaction upon starvation, and tRNA gene clustering (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Many of these specific condensin-mediated interactions were shown to have important functions in gene regulation (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It remains to be established if the general genome compaction by condensin similarly results in global effects on gene expression.</p>
<p>In this study, we addressed the relationship between condensin-mediated chromatin compaction and global gene expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C-seq) in wild-type, condensin-depleted and condensin-mutant cells. We find that loss of condensin function leads to a shift from shorter to longer-range chromosomal interactions, indicating that condensin helps restrict pairwise interactions to nearby loci within the genome. Our data also show a fundamental condensin-dependent organization of ChrXII, the sole rDNA-bearing chromosome in yeast. Intriguingly, these architectural changes were not associated with broad changes in global gene expression levels. These data suggest that the structural changes associated with condensin depletion are not directly coupled to transcription.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Cell culture and preparation of nuclei</title>
<p>Inducible nuclear depletion of condensin was achieved using the anchor away approach (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), specifically by tagging the condensin subunit Brn1 in the SK1 background.</p>
<p>Asynchronous cells were grown in 200 ml of YPD to OD1 at 30&#x00B0;C. Condensin depletion was induced using rapamycin at 1&#x03BC;g.ml<sup>-1</sup> for 30 mins. Temperature-sensitive condensin mutants harbor the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> allele in the SK1 background (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Wild type and mutant yeast cells were grown asynchronously at permissive temperature (23&#x00B0;C) until OD1, then shifted to restrictive temperature (37&#x00B0;C), or kept at permissive temperature, for 2 hrs. For 3C-seq experiments, yeast cells were fixed for 30 mins at room temperature by adding formaldehyde to the media at 3&#x0025; and quenching using 125mM glycine. Spheroplasts were prepared by digesting the cell wall with zymolyase (amsbio, UK) and then resuspending in dounce buffer (0.35M sucrose, 15mM Hepes KOH, 0.5mM EGTA, 5mM MgCl2, 10mM KCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 0.5&#x0025; Triton X-100 and 0.25&#x0025; NP40). Nuclei were released using a type B dounce and glass pestle on ice. Cellular debris was removed by spinning at 230g. The supernatant was spun down at 2000g to isolate the nuclei. Nuclei were stained with the vital dye Crystal violet in citric acid (Fisher Scientific, PA, USA) to allow counting on a hemocytometer as described previously (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>

<title>3C-seq</title>
<p>For the anchor-away samples, 3C-seq was used as previously published (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). &#x223C;100 million nuclei were permeabilized by incubating in 500&#x03BC;l NEB restriction enzyme buffer (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with 0.3&#x0025; SDS for 1 hr at 37&#x00B0;C in a thermomixer. SDS was quenched by adding Triton X-100 to 2&#x0025;, and nuclei were incubated for 1 hr further at 37&#x00B0;C in a thermomixer. Chromatin was digested using 1200U of restriction enzyme HindIII (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) overnight at 37&#x00B0;C in a water bath. Following digestion, the volume was increased to a total of 8ml using 1x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). Chromatin fragments were ligated with 750U of T4 DNA ligase overnight at 15&#x00B0;C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). For the temperature-sensitive samples, <italic>in situ</italic> 3C-seq was performed based on two protocols (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Briefly, nuclei were permeabilized by incubating in 50&#x03BC;l of 0.5&#x0025; SDS for 10 mins at 62&#x00B0;C in a thermomixer. SDS was quenched by adding 170&#x03BC;l of 1.5&#x0025; Triton X-100, and nuclei were incubated for 15 mins at 37&#x00B0;C in a thermomixer. 25&#x03BC;l of 10X NEB restriction enzyme buffer was added and chromatin was digested using 1200U of restriction enzyme HindIII overnight at 37&#x00B0;C in a water bath. Following digestion, the volume was increased to a total of 1.15ml using 1x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). Chromatin fragments were ligated with 150U of T4 DNA ligase overnight at 15&#x00B0;C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). 3C DNA was purified using Qiagen PCR purification columns. DNA was sheared using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, NJ, USA) by diluting 500ng of purified DNA in 50&#x03BC;l and sonicating with the following settings: 15 secs ON and 90 secs OFF for 7 cycles, with a quick vortex and spin-down after 4 cycles. Libraries were prepared from the sonicated DNA by PCR following the addition of Illumina TruSeq adapters as described previously (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Sequencing was performed at the NYU Biology Genomics core using paired-end 50-bp sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq-2500.</p>

<title>3C-seq spike-in</title>
<p>To a subset of samples, we spiked in 10&#x0025; <italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclei prior to continuing with the 3C-seq protocol above. <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 embryos were washed with 500&#x03BC;l of chitinase buffer (110mM NaCl, 40mM KCl, 2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5) and digested with 5U of chitinase (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). The resulting blastomeres were spun-down at 2000g for 5 mins at 4&#x00B0;C then resuspended in PBS with 1&#x0025; formaldehyde and fixed for 30 mins while nutating. Formaldehyde was quenched with 125mM glycine. Blastomeres were washed and nuclei released in dounce buffer (see yeast nuclei preparation). Cellular debris was removed by spinning at 100g. The supernatant was spun at 2000g to isolate the nuclei.</p>

<title>3C-seq data analysis</title>
<p>The data statistics, such as read number and mapping efficiency, for each replicate are given in Supplemental File 1. Data were processed using previously described methods, using the Mirny lab python packages (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/mirnylab/">https://bitbucket.org/mirnylab/</ext-link></underline>) (<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Briefly,iterative mapping was used to map each side of the paired-end read individually. For the spike-in experiments, the reads that uniquely mapped to either <italic>C. elegans</italic> (WS220) or <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (SacCer3) were filtered and used separately for each species. Reads were then assigned to the closest restriction fragment end. Counts were binned into 10kb bins. Default filters were applied to remove outlier regions such as those with poor coverage (bottom 1&#x0025; or with less than 50&#x0025; of bin sequenced) or contain PCR duplicates (top 0.05&#x0025;). Iterative correction was used to correct for potential biases including mappability and GC content, without pre-defining what these biases are.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>ChIP-seq and data analysis</title>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Samples were immunoprecipitated with 20&#x03BC;l anti-V5 agarose affinity gel (Sigma). ChIP and input DNA was resonicated using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, NJ, USA) with the following settings: 30 secs ON and 30 secs OFF for 5 cycles. Libraries were prepared by PCR following the addition of Illumina TruSeq adapters as described previously (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). 50-bp single-end sequencing was accomplished on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument at the NYU Biology Genomics core. Sequencing reads were mapped to the SK1 genome (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) using Bowtie (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Reads that mapped to only one location without mismatches were used in further analyses. Further processing was completed using MACS-2.1.0 (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/taoliu/MACS">https://github.com/taoliu/MACS</ext-link></underline>) (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Reads were extended towards 3&#x2019; ends to a final length of 200bp and probabilistically determined PCR duplications were removed. Pileups of both the input and ChIP libraries were SPMR-normalized (signal per million reads), followed by a calculation of the fold-enrichment of the ChIP data over the input data, resulting in the ChIP-coverage scores that are shown in the figures.</p>

<title>mRNA-seq with S. pombe spike-in</title>
<p>4.5ml of OD1 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was mixed with 500&#x03BC;l of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (972h) at OD1. To ensure that the ratio of <italic>S. pombe</italic> to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was consistent between samples, genomic DNA was isolated from 10&#x0025; of the mixed cells and used for qPCR. Briefly, serial dilutions of <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were amplified using both <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> specific primers (Supplemental File 1) to generate standard curves, to which the amplification from experimental samples was compared. qPCR measured ratios of spike-in to experimental sample ranged between &#x223C;10&#x0025;&#x002B;/-2 (values for each provided in Supplemental File 1).

<p>RNA was purified over Qiagen RNeasy column following the recommended yeast protocol. mRNA was selected using Sera-Mag oligo-dT beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Germany) from 0.5-10&#x03BC;g of total mRNA. cDNA was prepared based on incorporation of deoxyuridine triphosphates (dUTPs) during cDNA synthesis using a previously described protocol (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Libraries were prepared from the cDNA by PCR following the addition of Illumina TruSeq adapters (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

Correction of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> based on <italic>S. pombe</italic> spike-in was done as previously published (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Briefly, a linear model was fitted to <italic>S. pombe</italic> spike-in data, comparing read counts of expressed genes (CPM &#x003E;0.5) in the wild type to other experimental conditions. The coefficients from this linear model were then used to correct the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> expression values.

<title>Results</title>
<p>To assess how condensin regulates chromosomal interactions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (yeast), we performed 3C-seq analyses, which capture the frequency of pair-wise contacts between genomic loci (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Unlike metazoans, yeast contains a single condensin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We acutely removed condensin from yeast nuclei using the inducible anchor-away system targeted against the kleisin subunit Brn1. In this system, proteins tagged with the FRB domain of human TOR kinase can be conditionally depleted from the nucleus by addition of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Validating this approach, the parental anchor-away strain was capable of growing on rapamycin plates whereas a strain containing FRB-tagged Brn1 was not (Fig. S1A). In an independent approach, we used a strain bearing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Ycs4 subunit (<italic>ycs4-2</italic>) to conditionally inactivate condensin by shifting cells to the non-permissive temperature of 37&#x00B0;C (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Sequencing showed that this allele harbors two mutations, which change amino acids 219 (methionine to lysine) and 225 (cysteine to arginine) of Ycs4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Shift from short to longer-range chromosomal interactions in the absence of condensing</title>
<p>Plotting normalized interaction frequencies between 10kb bins of the wild-type dataset showed many of the features common to chromosome conformation capture experiments in yeast and other organisms (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Interactions between loci on the same chromosome are more frequent compared to <italic>trans</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Moreover, distance-decay curves show that such <italic>cis</italic> interaction frequencies decrease as the genomic distance between loci increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Condensin depletion led to a reduction in local interactions with a marked increase in <italic>trans</italic> interactions and long-range <italic>cis</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). This result is also supported by the flattened distance decay curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and highlighted by plotting the z-score subtraction of interaction frequencies between Brn1-depleted and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>). An increase in longer-range interactions at the expense of short-range (&#x003C;100 kb) was also observed in <italic>ycs4-2</italic> strain at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>, S1B).</p>
<p>To ensure that the change in the range of chromosomal interactions upon condensin inactivation was not due to technical differences between the wild-type and mutant samples, we used a spike-in approach. We added <italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclei at similar proportions to wild-type and <italic>ycs4-2</italic> nuclei before proceeding with the 3C-seq protocol. Reads unique to each organism were then used independently to produce decay curves of interaction frequencies within each sample. The spike-in controls showed a similar pattern of decay for interaction-frequencies in 3C-seq reactions containing wild-type and <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutant nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1I</xref>), validating that condensin mutation causes a shift from short to long-range interactions in yeast.</p>
<p>These results are consistent with condensin promoting local compaction across the genome. The notion of global genome decompaction upon condensin inactivation in cycling cells agrees with recent depletion experiments using an auxin-dependent degron on the condensin subunit Smc2 in mitosis (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), whereas a temperature-dependent degron on Smc2 led to more limited effects (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>

<title>Centromere and telomeres maintain clustering in the absence of condensin</title>
<p>A characteristic feature of yeast genome organization is the tethered clustering of centromeres and telomeres in the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>-<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). These features have previously been observed through chromosome capture approaches (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), and were also apparent in our data. In the heat maps, the strong <italic>trans</italic> interactions between centromeres were observed as an array of foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, nearly all of the 240 potential pairwise interactions between centromeres were in the top 1&#x0025; of all interactions, with a significant enrichment compared to random shuffling of centromeres across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Following condensin depletion, centromere clustering was maintained as previously observed with immunofluorescence (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), indicating that centromere attachment to the spindle pole is largely unaffected by condensin removal. We note, however, that condensin may have a transient role in centromere clustering at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>

<p>We also observed significant enrichment of pairwise telomere interactions in wild type, though the strength of clustering was weaker compared to centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar to centromeres, condensin depletion did not significantly alter telomere clustering in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The condensin independence is likely due to the physical tethering of these loci to the nuclear periphery and does not reflect a general resistance of these regions to condensin-mediated effects. Accordingly, <italic>cis</italic> interactions of regions immediately flanking the centromeres were reduced upon condensin depletion similar to the rest of the genome (Fig. S2A, B). These data indicate that the clustering of centromeres and telomeres is refractory to the large changes in chromosomal interactions upon condensin depletion.</p>

<title>Condensin is required for clustering of a subset of tRNA genes</title>
<p>Previous cytological analyses revealed condensin-dependent clustering and association of yeast tRNA genes with the nucleolus, the location of the rDNA (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). We failed to detect significant association of tRNA genes with the rDNA (Fig. S2C, D), but tRNA-tRNA interactions were indeed enriched within the top 1&#x0025; of all interactions in wild-type cells. These interactions were reduced upon condensin depletion in our data sets, suggesting a role for condensin in tRNA gene clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Further analyses of homotypic clustering of tRNA genes showed differences in the extent and condensin-dependence of clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Of the 40 tRNA gene families, 8 exhibited significant condensin-dependent homotypic interactions (Fig. S2E), including the t<sup>LEU</sup>[CAA] genes used in previous FISH experiments (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Interestingly, the largest tRNA gene family in the yeast genome (t<sup>ASP</sup>[GUC]) exhibited robust clustering that was unaffected by condensin inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The reason for this unusual behavior is unclear because the 11 genes of this family are dispersed among other tRNA genes on multiple chromosomes. They are also not enriched near centromeres or telomeres, indicating that the observed condensin-independent clustering is not a result of hitchhiking with those features. Moreover, although tRNA genes are sites of condensin binding (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), ChIP-seq analysis of the condensin subunit Smc4 revealed no clear correlation between relative condensin enrichment and condensin-dependent clustering (Fig. S2F), indicating that condensin binding is not sufficient to explain the specificity of tRNA gene clustering. We conclude that condensin-mediated clustering of tRNA genes is not a general phenomenon and that at least one tRNA gene family uses a condensin-independent clustering mechanism.</p>

<title>Chromosome XII has a unique condensin-dependent organization</title>
<p>One chief point of condensin binding across the yeast genome (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) is the rDNA, which resides in a single &#x223C;1Mb array in the middle of ChrXII.

<p>Remarkably, the effect of condensin is not symmetric; the centromere-proximal left flank of the rDNA (ChrXII-L) exhibited a stronger and more far-reaching loss of local interactions upon condensin depletion than the centromere-distal right flank (ChrXII-R; Fig. S3C) (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). To test if this asymmetry is driven by polar interactions of rDNA array with either flank, we performed an <italic>in-silico</italic> 4C analysis. We considered the entire rDNA as a single repeat and determined its interactions with the rest of ChrXII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These analyses revealed that the rDNA interacts more with ChrXII-L than ChrXII-R in wild-type cells, with particularly strong interactions between the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>, S3D). This contact was specific because there was no enrichment of interactions between the rDNA and the centromeres of other chromosomes (Fig. S2G). Furthermore, unlike the pairwise interactions between centromeres, the interaction between the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic> depended on condensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>, S3D).</p>
<p>The interaction between the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic> could be the result of specialized tethering sequences near <italic>CEN12</italic> or of their presence on the same chromosome. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used previously published Hi-C data from a synthetic yeast strain in which the rDNA array was inserted onto ChrIII (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Translocation of the rDNA onto ChrIII was sufficient to create two domains on ChrIII, similar to what is observed for the native ChrXII (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in-silico</italic> 4C analysis of this strain showed interaction between rDNA and <italic>CEN3</italic>, whereas the interaction with <italic>CEN12</italic> was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref> and S3E), suggesting that the rDNA specifically interacts with the centromere of the same chromosome. It is possible that condensin-mediated tethering of rDNA to centromere (reported to occur specifically during anaphase (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)) may be important for proper segregation of the rDNA array, for which condensin function was shown to be essential (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>).</p>
<p>The condensin dependence of the rDNA-<italic>CEN12</italic> interaction suggested that condensin might be particularly active in the interval between these two loci. Indeed, analysis of Smc4-Pk9 binding along ChrXII revealed a specific enrichment of condensin between the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic> in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Condensin binding is sharply delimited, as binding is at the genome-wide average on the left side of <italic>CEN12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>). No other centromere showed a comparably asymmetric condensin enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3G</xref>). These data indicate that the genomic interval between <italic>CEN12</italic> and the rDNA forms a domain of increased condensin binding and condensin-dependent interactions akin to TADs in higher eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Condensin-dependent changes to chromosomal interactions are not coupled to global changes in gene expression</title>
<p>Given the broad effects of condensin on chromosome compaction, we sought to define the effect of these changes on gene expression. To quantify global changes in gene expression levels, we performed spike-in normalized mRNA-seq analysis upon condensin inactivation. Unexpectedly, there were no gross changes to global levels of gene expression following acute condensin depletion by anchor-away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Although it is possible that 30 min of condensin depletion are not sufficient to mount a robust transcriptional response, we do not favor this idea because transcriptional responses in yeast occur within minutes (<xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and this time frame is sufficient to observe a robust loss of compaction by 3C-seq. However, to further test this apparent resilience of the transcriptional program to genome decompaction, we also compared global expression levels in <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutants after two hours of incubation at restrictive temperature. Again, no change in global gene expression was observed in response to condensin inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results suggest that the changes in chromosomal interactions observed upon condensin depletion do not lead to immediate changes in global transcription.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutation was associated with a temperature-independent effect on the global level of gene expression. Both at the permissive and restrictive temperatures, the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> strain exhibited significantly increased average expression compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These data suggest that the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutation is not fully functional at the permissive temperature, consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Notably, the biggest effect of <italic>ycs4-2</italic> on gene expression was observed on ChrXII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>), with a particular enrichment of upregulated genes on ChrXII-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This spatial bias was not due to changes in copy number (Fig. S4A) or differences in the size of the rDNA array (Fig. S4B). Other possible reasons are considered in the Discussion.</p>
<p>To further separate the effects of temperature and the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutation, we hierarchically clustered genes across the different conditions based on expression level. This analysis revealed four major patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Cluster 1 represents a substantial proportion of the genome and was sensitive to the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Clusters 2 and 3 reflected temperature dependent changes to gene expression with gene expression increasing or decreasing, respectively. Lastly, cluster 4 included genes that responded to temperature in wild type but not upon <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutation. Importantly, GO analysis did not find enrichment of cell-cycle controlled genes in any of the clusters, indicating that the expression changes were not secondary to a cell-cycle arrest at the restrictive temperature. Overall, almost 50&#x0025; of the genome displayed increased expression in the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> strain compared to wild type at 23&#x00B0;C, the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Finally, we also evaluated if the four gene expression clusters capture any condensin-dependent changes in the anchor-away data. There was no difference in the expression of the four clusters upon condensin depletion by Brn1 anchor-away (Fig. S4C). We conclude that genome decompaction triggered by removal of condensin does not have immediate effects on global gene expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we show that condensin is essential for the organization of the whole <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome without controlling global gene expression levels. The primary effect of condensin depletion and mutation was a reduction in the frequency of short-range interactions, suggesting that the mechanism by which condensins mediate chromosome compaction is through promoting local interactions (&#x003C;100kb). Condensin-mediated interactions at this scale are consistent with computational models of chromosome compaction before and during early prophase (<xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The molecular mechanism by which condensin favors short-range interactions may be based on the &#x201C;loop extrusion&#x201D; model, which has been gaining recent traction (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>-<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). In this model, a DNA loop is pushed through the condensin ring to progressively get larger. If condensin were repeatedly unloaded from chromosomes due to instability and/or slower processivity of extrusion, the result would be condensins mediating short-range interactions (<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Alternatively, condensin may stabilize contacts between independent loci that occur more frequently over short distance due to the polymer nature of chromosomes (<xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>).</p>
<p>Condensin also promotes specific long-range and interchromosomal interactions such as clustering of tRNA genes. A recent study in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> failed to observe the effect of condensin depletion in tRNA gene clustering (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). We predict that this result was due to insufficient condensin depletion based on the mild effect on genome-wide Hi-C interactions (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Indeed, a second study reported greater effects of condensin depletion on Hi-C interactions in yeast (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The notion that condensin functions at different length scales is supported by analyses in fission yeast, where condensin was shown to mediate long-range clustering of cell-cycle regulated genes in addition to local compaction (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). While loop extrusion is an effective model to explain formation of chromosomal loops at different scales, how condensin mediates interchromosomal interactions such as those between certain tRNA genes remains unclear. It is possible that specific recruitment of condensins by TFIIIC and transcription factors creates condensin-mediated links between these loci (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
<p>One possible consequence of condensin-mediated chromosomal interactions is the formation of defined TAD structures, as observed in fission yeast (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="c76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our data support a similar function in budding yeast, albeit at a more limited scale. In particular, condensin is required for a nested condensin-enriched domain between the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic>. Similar to TAD boundaries (<xref rid="c77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>), both domain boundaries, the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic>, are highly bound by condensin. It is possible that when strong condensin recruitment domains, such as the rDNA and <italic>CEN12</italic>, are adjacent to each other, condensin binding is enhanced in the intervening region. Such behavior would be akin to <italic>C. elegans</italic> dosage compensation, where a specialized condensin complex is recruited to specific recruitment sites, from which it spreads out (<xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other organisms, condensins have been linked to the regulation of transcription (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="c79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="c80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Our data indicate that the global gene expression program is largely unaffected by condensin depletion in yeast. We did observe an overall increase in gene expression in the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> strain but these effects were independent of temperature and thus not linked to increased chromosome decompaction upon condensin inactivation. As the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> mutation already causes transcriptional phenotypes at room temperature (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), these differences could be an indirect result of the chronic presence of the condensin mutation as opposed to the acute response to rapid depletion of condensin from the nucleus by the anchor-away system. Furthermore, the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> strain may have adapted transcriptionally to compensate the effect of the condensin mutation. Indeed, the <italic>YCS4</italic> gene is located on ChrXII-R, within the region containing an enrichment of genes that were upregulated in the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> strain, and mRNA levels of the <italic>ycs4-2</italic> allele were elevated approximately 2-fold compared to wild type.</p>
<p>The observation that acute depletion of condensin caused immediate effects on genome organization but not on gene expression suggests that transcription can be decoupled from global chromosome structure. We note, however, that chromosome condensation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is substantially less dramatic than observed for mitotic chromosomes in larger eukaryotes (<xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Furthermore, gene regulatory elements in yeast are localized near the promoters and may not depend on specific chromosomal interactions as enhancers and promoters in bigger eukaryotic genomes. Finally, other energy-dependent chromatin organizers, including other SMC proteins may compensate for the loss of condensin and provide robustness against acute changes in condensin activity.</p>
