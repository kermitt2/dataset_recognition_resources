<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Because human epidermal growth factor-like receptor (HER) 2 is expressed on the surface of human pancreatic carcinoma cells to varying degrees, trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), is expected to exert antibody-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the cells. However, some reports found that the effect of trastuzumab against human pancreatic carcinoma cells was limited because most express only limited HER2.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We examined whether anti-CD137 stimulating mAb could enhance trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1, a human pancreatic cancer cell line with low HER2 expression, in vitro.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Supplementation of anti-CD137 mAb could improve trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 which was insufficient without this stimulating antibody. The ADCC differed in individual cells, and this was related to the expression of CD137 on the surface of NK cells after trastuzumab stimulation in association with the Fc&#x03B3;-RIIIA polymorphism. NK cells with Fc&#x03B3;-RIIIA-VV/VF showed high levels of ADCC against Panc-1, but those with Fc&#x03B3;-RIIIA-FF did not show optimal ADCC. In addition, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against the human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 with high HER2 expression was generally high and not affected by the Fc&#x03B3;-RIIIA polymorphism.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results demonstrated that in Fc&#x03B3;-RIIIA-VV/VF-carrying hosts, trastuzumab plus &#x03B1;CD137 mAb could induce effective ADCC against HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. This also indicates the therapeutic potential for unresectable human pancreatic cancer, in which HER-2 expression is generally low.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pancreatic carcinoma is difficult to cure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and the prognosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients is very poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Although various attempts have been made to establish innovative therapeutic regimens, the efficacy of current chemotherapy regimens remains inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Among the chemotherapy regimens used to treat unresectable pancreatic carcinoma, gemcitabine-based ones are common because they maintain the quality of the remaining life of patients without serious complications. Among newly established regimens, the combination of gemcitabine plus aluminum-bound (nab)-paclitaxel was reported to increase the mean survival interval (MSI) from 6 to 10 months compared with gemcitabine alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the FOLFILINOX regimen greatly improves the MSI of patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma, although many patients fail to complete this regimen because of its serious side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Thus, the clinical efficacy of these regimens should be improved and new strategies for the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are needed.</p>
<p>Trastuzumab (Tmab) is a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human epidermal growth factor-like receptor (HER) 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] expressed on various tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], especially in breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and gastric carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Antigen-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is the initial mechanism of action of Tmab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], and there are many reports on the clinical efficacy of Tmab against HER2-expressing tumors, especially against breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. HER2 is also expressed in varying levels on the surface of human pancreatic carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and some reports indicated that Tmab induces ADCC against human pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. However, the clinical efficacy of Tmab against human pancreatic carcinoma is inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] because it was usually investigated in HER2-high-expressing cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], whereas most human pancreatic cancers express only low levels of HER2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Hence, the clinical efficacy of Tmab against human pancreatic carcinoma remains controversial.</p>
<p>Recently, some groups have tried to up-regulate Tmab-mediated ADCC with the addition of various monoclonal antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Notably, Kohrt HE et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] and Houot R et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] reported that anti-CD137 mAb (&#x03B1;CD137) could enhance the Tmab-mediated ADCC against human breast cancer cells. CD137 (4-1BB) is known to act as a co-stimulatory molecule in combination with Fc receptor-mediated stimulatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and is expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells after stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Thus, the hypothesis that the addition of &#x03B1;CD137 to Tmab could up-regulate ADCC against HER2-low-expressing target cells was put forward.</p>
<p>Based on that hypotheses and previous findings, we investigated the effects of &#x03B1;CD137 for NK cell activation to up-regulate Tmab-mediated ADCC against HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines as part of efforts to
a new regimen for unresectable human pancreatic carcinoma.</p>

<title>Cell lines and cultures</title>
<p>Human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines Panc-1 (HER2-low-expressing cell line), Capan-1 (HER2-high-expressing cell line), and the NK cell-sensitive thymoma cell line K562 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HER-2 expression on the surface of Panc-1 and Capan-1 was confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-A</xref>). All these cell lines were maintained according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. In brief, Panc-1 was cultured with Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (DMEM, Gibco Life Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) supplemented with 10&#x0025; heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10&#x0025; penicillin and streptomycin solutions (Gibco). Capan-1 was cultured with ISCOVE modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10&#x0025; FCS. Cells were removed by short-term incubation with trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and about one-third to one-fourth of the viable cells were removed and resuspended in fresh culture medium twice weekly. K562 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x0025; heat-inactivated FCS, HEPES-buffer solution 5 mM, penicillin and streptomycin solutions 100 U/ml, L-glutamine 2 mM, sodium pyruvate solution 2 mM, and nonessential amino acid solution 2 mM (all purchased from Gibco-BRL), modified vitamins 2 mM (DS Pharma, Osaka, Japan), and 2-mercaptoethanol 2 mM (Sigma Chemical).</p>

<title>Monoclonal antibodies</title>
<p>Tmab was kindly provided by Roche-Chugai Japan Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). It was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 100 &#x03BC;g/ml and stored at &#x2013;80&#x00B0;C until use. Goat-poly anti-human CD137 stimulation Ab (&#x03B1;CD137, R&#x0026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was also suspended in PBS 10 &#x03BC;g/ml and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until use.</p>

<title>Preparation of human NK cells</title>
<p>Peripheral blood was obtained from 12 healthy individuals who were serologically confirmed to be free from hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus infection. This study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the Institutional Review Committee of Nippon Medical School. Human NK cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from heparinized blood using the Ficoll Paque (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) density-gradient method. The EasySep human NK cell enrichment kit (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) was used to separate human NK cells according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Briefly, PBMCs were suspended in the recommended buffer and incubated with tetrameric antibody complexes recognizing CD3, CD4, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD36, CD66b, CD123, HLA-DR, and glycophorin A for 10 min at 4&#x00B0;C. Dextran-coated magnetic particles were then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min at 4&#x00B0;C. All fractions including the coated cells were placed into the EasySep magnetic chamber for 2.5 min, and those unlabeled were collected as the NK cell-enriched fractions. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x0025; FCS and 10&#x0025; penicillin and streptomycin solutions (assay medium). The purity of NK cells collected in this process was greater than 90&#x0025; as confirmed by the expression of CD3 and CD56 in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-B</xref>). The cytotoxic activity of each NK cell was titrated against that of K562 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-C</xref>). NK cells were resuspended in culture media and used for the following assays.</p>

<title>Cell culture procedures</title>
<p>1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup>/well of each target cell line was suspended in 1 ml of assay medium and sheeted in a 48-well flat-bottom culture plate. Tmab 0 to 10 &#x03BC;g/ml was added to each well and incubated for 0, 2, and 12 h at 37&#x00B0;C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in assay medium, and 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>3</sup>/well of each target cell line was sheeted in a 96-cell U-bottom plate and incubated with 10-to 40-fold amounts of NK cells for 4 h at 37&#x00B0;C. Anti-CD137 mAb 10 &#x03BC;g/ml was added to some wells to examine whether it could enhance Tmab-induced ADCC. After incubation, the plates were centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rpm, and culture supernatants were collected for cytotoxicity assays and cytokine titration assays. The cells were harvested and used for evaluation of the kinetics of cell surface molecules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACSCant-II (BD-Bioscience, San Jose, CA). For staining cell surface molecules, 500,000 cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and pelleted. The following antibodies were used: fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD3; phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human CD56 (BD Bioscience); PE-conjugated anti-human CD16 (clone 3G8), CD137, PD1, and NKG2D (Biolegend, San Diego, CA); PE-conjugated anti-human CD16 (clone MEM154, Immunological Sciences, Rome); and FITC or PE-conjugated mouse IgG1, Isotypecontrol (Biolegend). Propidium iodide was used to confirm the percentage of dead cells. One hundred thousand events were acquired for each sample and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Determination of FcR&#x03B3;III polymorphism</title>
<p>The FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism of NK cells was evaluated according to the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. In brief, freshly isolated NK cells were harvested and stained separately with two anti-FcR&#x03B3;IIIA mAbs: clone 3G8 and clone MEM-154. The 3G8 mAb binds to a nonpolymorphic epitope of FcR&#x03B3;IIIA, whereas binding of MEM-154 mAb is dependent on the valine expression of FcR&#x03B3;IIIA. The percentage of cells stained positively for each Ab was counted, and the ratio of MEM-154 positive cells/3G8 positive cells was calculated. The FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism was determined using the formula V/V: MEM154/3G8 &#x003E;0.62, F/F: &#x003C;0.04, and F/V: ratio between 0.15 and 0.48.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Cytotoxicity assay</title>
<p>The CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for evaluating NK cell cytotoxicity according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. In brief, 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>3</sup> treated target cells were resuspended in 50 &#x03BC;l of assay medium and placed in a 96-well round-bottom culture plate. Ten- to 40-fold amounts of NK cells suspended in 50 &#x03BC;l of assay medium were added to each well and also sheeted in empty wells to measure the spontaneous lysis of effector cells. Lysis solution 50 &#x03BC;l and assay medium 50 &#x03BC;l were sheeted in another well for measurement of maximal and minimal lysis. The plate was centrifuged at 250 g for 4 min and incubated for 4 h at 37&#x00B0;C. Lysis solution 10 &#x03BC;l was added to each well 45 min before the end of incubation. The plate was centrifuged again for 4 min at 250 g, and then culture supernatants were collected and replaced in a 96-well flat-bottom assay plate. Substrate mixed buffer 50 &#x03BC;l was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature while shaded from light. Stop solutions were added to each well at the end of incubation. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the supernatant was measured as absorbance at 490 nm using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The percentage of specific cytotoxicity was calculated by the following formula: Percent cytotoxicity &#x003D; (Sample-Effector-minimal)/(Maximal-minimal) &#x00D7; 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Measurement of cytokines</title>
<p>NK cells were plated at 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in a 48-well plate and stimulated with and without Tmab 10 &#x03BC;g/ml for 48 h at 37&#x00B0;C. Culture supernatants were collected and stored immediately at &#x2013;80&#x00B0;C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to titrate interferon (IFN)-&#x03B3; and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x03B1; in the culture supernatants using DUOSET anti-human IFN-&#x03B3; and TNF-&#x03B1; ELISA kits (R&#x0026;D Systems).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The paired t-test and Man-Whitney U-test were performed to determine the significance of differences between groups in this study using GRAPHPAD PRISM (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). All experiments were repeated five times, and a p value of &#x003C; 0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant difference.</p>

<title>Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-high-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line</title>
<p>First, the Tmab-mediated ADCC against Capan-1, the HER2-high-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line, was confirmed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2-A</xref>, while NK cells, isotype IgG, and Tmab did not demonstrate cytotoxicity against Capan-1, 10 &#x03BC;g/ml of Tmab added to NK cells lysed Capan-1. To determine the optimal conditions for inducing Tmab-mediated ADCC, the indicated concentrations of Tmab were examined, and no difference was seen between any of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2-B</xref>). The necessity for Tmab pretreatment of Capan-1 was also examined, and the results indicated that long-term pretreatment with Tmab decreased the ADCC against Capan-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2-C</xref>). Based on those results, we performed the following ADCC assay with 10 &#x03BC;g/ml of Tmab without pretreatment of target cells.</p>

<p>LDH-releasing assays were performed to confirm the appropriate conditions for Tmab-mediated ADCC against Capan-1, a HER2-high-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line. A: The contribution of Tmab to ADCC against Capan-1 was confirmed. The effector/target (E/T) ratio was set at 10:1, and 10 &#x03BC;g/ml of Tmab and isotype IgG were used. B: To confirm the appropriate concentration of Tmab, ADCC with the indicated dose of Tmab was measured. The E/T ratio was set at 40:1. C: To determine the necessity for the preadministration of Tmab to target cells, Capan-1 was incubated with 10 &#x03BC;g/ml of Tmab for the indicated times. Cells were harvested and ADCC was evaluated. The E/T ratio was set at 40:1.</p></caption>

<title>Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line</title>
<p>Next, Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line was examined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-A</xref>, although the Tmab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 was elevated, the level was significantly weaker compared with that against Capan-1. The results in a representative individual cell are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-B</xref>.

<title>Anti-CD137 mAb enhanced Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line</title>
<p>According to the results above, Tmab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 could be improved. We therefore investigated the expression of various molecules, including CD137, associated with the activation of NK cells following Tmab treatment to determine which showed greater stimulation of NK cells. It was confirmed that only CD137 expression was up-regulated after Tmab stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-A</xref>). Moreover, the combination of &#x03B1;CD137 with Tmab enhanced Tmab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-B</xref>). However, the individual cell results showed that ADCC against Panc-1 was up-regulated when the expression of CD137 was increased following Tmab treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-C</xref>), whereas it did not improve when CD137 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-D</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of the FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism on Tmab-induced ADCC against pancreatic cancer cell lines</title>
<p>It is known that the FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism is closely associated with the affinity to IgG-Fc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], and the effects of the polymorphism against HER2-expressing breast cancer cells were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. FcR&#x03B3;IIIA 158V/V or V/F (VV/VF) conjugates easily with IgG-Fc to induce ADCC efficiently, whereas FcR&#x03B3;IIIA 158F/F (FF) conjugates weakly to IgG-Fc, resulting in weak ADCC. Based on those findings, we determined the FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism of each NK cell taken from 12 healthy individuals participating in this study and examined the effects on Tmab/&#x03B1;CD137-mediated ADCC against human pancreatic cancer cell lines. CD137 expression was more significantly elevated after stimulation with Tmab in both FcR&#x03B3;IIIA VV/VF individuals (n=8) than in the FF group (n=4) against both Panc-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5-A</xref>, left panel) and Capan-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5-A</xref>, right panel). Notably, the difference in CD137 up-regulation between the VV/VF and FF groups was striking when Panc-1 was treated with Tmab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5-A</xref> left panel). We additionally examined changes in IFN-&#x03B3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5-B</xref>) and TNF-&#x03B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5-C</xref>) released from NK cells in both the VV/VF and FF groups before and after treatment with Tmab in combination with &#x03B1;CD137 and found that the levels of these cytokines increased in the VV/VF group in the presence of Tmab. However, the addition of &#x03B1;CD137 did not affect the levels of these cytokines. The addition of &#x03B1;CD137 mAb significantly improved Tmab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6-A</xref>, left panel) and improved more in VV/VF than in FF individuals, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6-B</xref>, left panel). In contrast, although Tmab greatly enhanced ADCC against Capan-1 in both VV/VF and FF groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6-A</xref>, right panel), the contribution of &#x03B1;CD137 was nonsignificant. Furthermore, the percentage of increase in ADCC did not differ between VV/VF and FF individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6-B</xref>, right panel).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results indicated that Tmab can improve ADCC against a HER2-high-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line. While Tmab-mediated ADCC against HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line was weak, it could be improved in the presence of &#x03B1;CD137 stimulating mAb to some degree. The FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism affected the activity of NK cells and was also associated with the level of Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cell line. However, it did not exhibit optimal Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-high-expressing pancreatic cancer cell line.</p>
<p>Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-high-expressing cell line Capan-1 was potent without the addition of &#x03B1;CD137 mAb and independent of the Fc&#x03B3;RIIIA polymorphism, indicating the clinical potential of Tmab for treating this type of pancreatic cancer. However, because HER2 expression on human pancreatic cancer cells is generally low, few patients are expected to benefit from a single administration of Tmab. Thus, additional techniques are needed to establish Tmab-related therapy for HER2-low-expressing cancer cells, the majority of human pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Our results indicated that the addition of &#x03B1;CD137 mAb enhanced Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cell line. A previous report showed that Tmab-mediated ADCC against HER2-expressing human breast cancer cell lines was about 30&#x0025; when they were exposed to a 20-fold amount of allogeneic NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Compared with that report, the cytotoxicity of Tmab plus &#x03B1;CD137 mAb-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line was slightly inferior to that against HER2-high-expressing human breast cancer cell lines because more NK cells were required to achieve the same level of ADCC in the former. Therefore increasing the number of NK cells in vivo will be crucial to establish combined therapy using Tmab and &#x03B1;CD137 mAb for the treatment of HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>It was shown that intravenous administration of paclitaxel in breast cancer patients could recruit NK cells in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The mechanism by which paclitaxel increases the number of peripheral NK cells is not known, although prior administration of paclitaxel is thought to up-regulate Tmab-mediated ADCC in the presence of &#x03B1;CD137 mAb against HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>We also found that the binding affinity of FcR&#x03B3;lIIA to IgG-Fc is strongly associated with the expression of CD137 on the surface of NK cells along with its activation after stimulation with Tmab. Previous reports showed that the FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism is closely associated with the level of Tmab-mediated ADCC against human HER2-expressing breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Our results indicated that the FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphism could also affect Tmab-mediated ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing human pancreatic cancer cell line, which seemed to be one of the reasons for the individual difference of ADCC levels against them. CD137 expression on the surface of NK cells with FcR-VV or -VF, which conjugates readily with IgG-Fc, was increased to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity in association with Tmab administration, resulting in improved ADCC against the HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cell line. However, the prevalence of FcR&#x03B3;IIIA-VV was reported to be 7&#x2013;10&#x0025;, that of - VF 34&#x2013;51 &#x0025;, and that of -FF 42&#x2013;56&#x0025; in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. The prevalence of FcR&#x03B3;IIIA-VV/VF/FF in this study was 50.0/16.7/33.3&#x0025;, however. Only a small cohort was analyzed in this study, which could explain the discrepancy, and more NK cells must be analyzed to clarify the relationship between FcR&#x03B3;IIIA polymorphisms and the ADCC against human HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cells.</p>
<p>Based on our present and previous results, approximately 40&#x2013;60&#x0025; of pancreatic cancer patients can be expected to benefit from Tmab plus &#x03B1;CD137 mAb combined therapy. It remains unclear how the efficacy of the combination therapy could be improved in FcR&#x03B3;IIIA-FF individuals, who comprise the major population in Japan. Further investigations will be needed to resolve this. In addition, levels of IFN-&#x03B3; and TNF-&#x03B1; released from NK cells after stimulation with Tmab increased more in VV/VF than in FF individuals, and there was no significant increase in the production of these cytokines after the addition of &#x03B1;CD137 mAb. The reason why activated, CD137-expressing NK cells did not secrete higher levels of cytokines after stimulation with &#x03B1;CD137 mAb was not determined in this study. More NK cells will be examined to resolve this.</p>
<p>For induction of effective ADCC by Tmab plus &#x03B1;CD137 mAb, a sufficient number of activated NK cells are necessary in patients with high-affinity polymorphisms against IgG-Fc. It will therefore be important to determine how to achieve this in vivo. The activity of NK cells is controlled by T-regulatory as well as T-helper lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], and gemcitabine, a standard reagent for treating unresectable pancreatic cancer, exhibits inhibitory activity against T-regulatory cells by down-regulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells that have a role in augmenting T-regulatory lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. As described above, paclitaxel increases NK cells in the periphery immediately after administration, and they would be activated with the addition of gemcitabine. Thus, the newly established nab-paclitaxel regimen plus gemcitabine combination therapy appears to have the potential to increase activated NK cells in vivo, and the addition of Tmab and &#x03B1;CD137 is expected to improve the efficacy of that regimen against pancreatic cancer. Further investigations will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
