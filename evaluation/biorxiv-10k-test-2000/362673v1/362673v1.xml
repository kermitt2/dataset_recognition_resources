<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Short-read sequencing technologies have made microbial genome sequencing cheap and accessible. However, closing genomes is often costly and assembling short reads from genomes that are repetitive and/or have extreme &#x0025;GC content remains challenging. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION have the potential to overcome these difficulties, although the best approach for harnessing their potential remains poorly evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We sequenced nine bacterial genomes spanning a wide range of GC contents using Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technologies to determine the advantages of each approach, both individually and combined. Assemblies using only MiSeq reads were highly accurate but lacked contiguity, a deficiency that was partially overcome by adding MinION reads to these assemblies. Even more contiguous genome assemblies were generated by using MinION reads for initial assembly, but these were more error-prone and required further polishing. This was especially pronounced when Illumina libraries were biased, as was the case for our strains with both high and low GC content. Increased genome contiguity dramatically improved the annotation of insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, likely because long-reads can disambiguate these highly repetitive but biologically important genomic regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Genome assembly using short-reads is challenged by repetitive sequences and extreme GC contents. Our results indicate that these difficulties can be largely overcome by using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Using MinION reads for assembly followed by polishing with Illumina reads generated the most contiguous genomes and enabled the accurate annotation of important but difficult to sequence genomic features such as insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. The combination of Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing is cost effective and dramatically advances studies of microbial evolution and genome-driven drug discovery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microbial genome sequencing has revealed how microorganisms adapt, evolve, and contribute to health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Although these were once enterprise-level projects, technological advances have now reached the point where microbial genomes can be sequenced routinely by small teams for a few hundred dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. These advances have particularly been driven by the maturation of short-read sequencing technologies such as those marketed by Illumina, which generate highly accurate reads (&#x003E;99&#x0025;) with lengths ranging from 75-300bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although Illumina technologies currently dominate the sequencing market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], difficulties remain that require further technological advances to fully realize the potential of microbial genome sequencing.</p>
<p>By their very nature, short reads alone cannot disambiguate repetitive genomic regions that are longer than their read length. Unfortunately, such repetitive regions are common in microbial genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], and include ribosomal genes, transposons, insertion sequences, CRISPR arrays, rhs toxins, secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, and many others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Repeats lead to unresolvable loops in the underlying genome assembly graph that are ultimately fragmented into contigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Because of this, short reads are theoretically incapable of closing most microbial genomes.</p>
<p>Genome assembly using most short-read datasets is also challenged by biases that occur during library preparation and that cause some genomic regions to be excluded from sequencing libraries. Common short-read library preparation methods (e.g., the Illumina Nextera protocol) include PCR amplification steps that are biased against regions of the genome with extreme GC contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Such regions are common among bacteria, whose average GC content ranges widely from 25&#x0025; to 75&#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Library preparation protocols that use transposases to fragment DNA may also non-randomly shear genomes during library preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], causing further biases that limit the utility of short-read sequencing.</p>
<p>De novo genome assembly algorithms struggle to assemble genomes when intergenic repeats are present and GC biases skew sequencing coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Fragmentation of such genomes prevents the accurate identification of mobile elements, the detection of horizontal gene transfers, the determination of gene copy number, and the discovery of biotechnologically important gene clusters such as those that encode for the production of secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. These deficiencies significantly lower the informational value of draft-quality genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, long-read, single-molecule sequencing has overcome some of the deficiencies of short-read sequencing. Library preparation protocols for single-molecule sequencing typically avoid bias-prone PCR steps, and long read lengths span genomic repeats to unambiguously resolve complex genomic regions. Some Illumina-based technologies such as mate pair libraries and linked reads (e.g., as commercialized by 10X Genomics) can also generate positionally linked sequences that span complex genomic repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], but these technologies still require library preparation protocols that are subject to the biases discussed above. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) currently markets the most widely used single-molecule sequencing technology, which can produce &#x003E; 7 Gb per run with read lengths averaging &#x003E;12 kbp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Although the error rate for PacBio sequencing is high (&#x007E;13&#x0025;), these errors are near-randomly distributed and can largely be corrected during assembly with adequate sequencing coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Unlike some Illumina sequencers (e.g., the MiSeq and MiniSeq), all PacBio sequencers require considerable capital investment, limiting general access to these technologies in individual laboratories. Nevertheless, PacBio sequencing has shown the enormous potential for long-read, single-molecule sequencing to routinely produce high-quality microbial genome assemblies that overcome many of the deficiencies of short-read sequencing.</p>
<p>The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION is a more recently developed long-read, single-molecule sequencing instrument. The MinION is a small benchtop device that can plug directly into a laptop via a USB3 port [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and that requires a relatively small upfront financial investment relative to PacBio instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This affordability and simplicity has enabled the rapid uptake of MinION sequencing by individual labs worldwide, and facilitated new applications such as tracking disease outbreaks in low-resource environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. MinION read lengths have no theoretical limit and reads &#x003E;2 million bp long have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. As with PacBio, MinION read quality is low compared to short read sequencing technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. These errors are less randomly distributed than for PacBio sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], meaning that increased read depth alone cannot completely overcome this high error rate, at least currently. However, error rates and bias profiles are expected to improve as the MinION and its associated base-calling software continues to develop, e.g., as demonstrated by the increased accuracy of the new Scrappy base caller that is currently under development by ONT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Two main strategies have been used to assemble bacterial genomes using MinION sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. In the first, MinION reads are used to enhance genome assemblies that are generated from short-read Illumina data. Here, MinION reads can scaffold contigs generated by Illumina sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] or be directly used in the assembly process to disambiguate regions of the assembly graph that cannot be resolved by Illumina sequencing alone (e.g., as implemented in the popular SPAdes and Unicycler software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]). Alternatively, MinION reads alone are used to generate an initial genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] that can then be further polished using either MinION or Illumina reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Such polishing is highly recommended for MinION-based genome assemblies due to their higher error rates relative to assemblies based on Illumina data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The increasing maturity and throughput of MinION sequencing is leading to its adoption for routine microbial genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Both MinION-only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] and Illumina-hybrid methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] have been validated extensively for bacteria with low and average GC contents. However, whether these approaches offer advantages when assembling bacterial genomes with high GC content remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]). We therefore compared the ability of Illumina and MinION sequencing technologies to produce high-quality assemblies of genomes from three bacterial genera (Flavobacterium, Aeromonas, and Pseudonocardia) that range in GC content from 31-73&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Flavobacterium spp. are gliding bacteria that can be found in diverse environments and that include important fish pathogens. Aeromonas spp. are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and can cause diseases in humans and fish or form beneficial symbioses, e.g., with fish and leeches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Pseudonocardia sp. are members of the Actinobacteria and, like many other members of this class, are important producers of antibiotics such as those involved in defensive symbioses with ants (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]). Our results validate MinION sequencing&#x2019;s ability to generate high-quality assemblies for all of these genomes, and especially emphasize the advantages of MinION sequencing when unbiased Illumina sequencing libraries are difficult to generate, e.g., for Actinobacteria with high GC content. These improved genome assemblies dramatically improve the annotation of repetitive genomic regions such as insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). MinION sequencing therefore has strong potential to overcome current limitations of short-read sequencing technologies and catalyze improved understanding of genome evolution and exploitation of genomic data for drug discovery.</p>

<title>Description of Strains</title>
<p>Three Aeromonas strains were used in this study. Aeromonas hydrophila str. CA-13-1 (hereafter Ah CA-13-1) was isolated from the wound of a patient undergoing post-operative leech therapy in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Aeromonas veronii str. CIP107763<sup>T</sup> (hereafter Av CIP107763<sup>T</sup>) was isolated from a mosquito midgut in France in 2015 and sequenced previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. A. veronii str. JG3 (hereafter Av JG3) is a derivative of a medicinal leech isolate Hm21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. All Aeromonas strains were grown either in LB broth or on agar plates for 16 hours at 30&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>The Flavobacterium strains used in this study were all isolated from necrotic gill tissues of farmed rainbow trout, Onchorhyncus mykiss. Flavobacterium sp. str. ARS-166-14 (hereafter Fs ARS-166-14) was isolated in October 2014, Flavobacterium columnare str. FC-081215-1 (hereafter Fc FC-081215-1) was isolated in August 2015, and F. columnare str. FC-100715-19 (hereafter Fc FC-100715-19) was isolated in October 2015, all on TYES agar. Frozen cells were grown on TYES agar, incubated for three days at 20&#x00B0;C, and then grown in liquid TYES broth for another 3 days at 15&#x00B0;C for Fs ARS-166-14 and 25&#x00B0;C for Fc FC-100715-19 and Fc FC-08-1215-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> bacteria sequenced during this study were isolated from individual <italic>Trachymyrmex septentrionalis</italic> ants collected from three locations within the United States: Paynes Creek Historic State Park, FL (<italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> sp. str. JKS002056, hereafter Ps JKS002056), Magnolia Springs State Park, GA (<italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> sp. str. JKS002072, hereafter Ps JKS002072), and Jones Lake State Park, NC (<italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> sp. str. Ps JKS002128). <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> were visible as white patches on the ants&#x2019; propleural plates, which were scraped using a sterile needle under a dissecting microscope to isolate <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> following Marsh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>DNA Isolation</title>
<p>DNA was extracted from <italic>Aeromonas and Flavobacterium</italic> isolates following a modified version of a previously published protocol for large scale genomic DNA isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. DNA in solution was not micropipetted during these extractions to minimize DNA fragmentation. DNA was extracted from single <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> colonies using the Epicentre MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA kit following the manufacture&#x2019;s protocol. Each <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> extraction was performed in triplicate using wide bore tips and taking care to pipette slowly to prevent DNA shearing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Library Preparation and Sequencing</title>
<p>The quality of all extracted DNA was assessed using an Agilent TapeStation 2200 protocol for genomic DNA, an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (High sensitivity DNA chip), and/or a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. All libraries were quantified using a Qubit<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> 2.0 fluorometer. For the <italic>Aeromonas and Flavobacterium</italic> strains, NexteraXT Illumina sequences were constructed by following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions for genomic tagmentation, PCR of tagged DNA, and PCR product cleanup. Libraries were diluted to 4nM for loading onto an Illumina MiSeq. TruSeq DNA PCR-Free libraries were created for each <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> strain following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol, shearing the DNA to 550 bp fragments using a Covaris M22 Focused-ultrasonicator. All Illumina libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using the 2&#x00D7;250bp protocol at the University of Connecticut Microbial Analysis Research and Services (MARS) facility. Demultiplexing was performed using Illumina Basespace (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index">https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index</ext-link>).</p>
<p>All genomes were also sequenced on a MK1B MinION device using R9.4 flow cells. <italic>Aeromonas and Flavobacterium</italic> libraries were prepared using the ONT EXP-NBD103 Barcode kit and the ONT &#x201C;Native Barcoding Genomic DNA Sequencing for the MinION Device&#x201D; protocol (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/protocols">https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/protocols</ext-link> on Oct 20, 2017) and performed without optional shearing steps to select for long reads. <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> libraries were prepared using the ONT &#x201C;1D gDNA Selecting for Long Reads Using SQK-LSK108&#x201D; protocol (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/protocols">https://nanoporetech.com/resource-centre/protocols</ext-link> on Dec 20, 2016) All strains were sequenced using the ONT MinKNOW NC_48h_Sequencing_Run_FLO-MIN107_SQKLSK108 protocol, except for JKS002056, which was sequenced using the older NC_48h_Sequencing_Run_FLO-MIN106_SQK-LSK108 MinKNOW protocol. The run duration ranged from 12 to 48 hours. Strains Av JG3, Fc FC-100715-19, and Ps JKS002072 were sequenced using two separate MinION runs that were combined for all analyses, except for the Av JG3 Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assembly where the few MinION reads (&#x003C;3000) from the first run were excluded because of their being processed using base calling software that was incompatible with Nanopolish.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Base calling and Read Preparation</title>
<p>MinION reads for Ps JKS002056 and the first Av JG3 run were base-called using the ONT Metrichor 1D protocol and locally using MinKNOW (ONT; Oct 20, 2017 release) respectively. All other MinION reads were based-called using Albacore (v.1.2.4). These software choices were determined by changes made by ONT to their cloud-based base calling system. All raw data was deposited in the NCBI database under the BioProject number PRJNA477342.</p>
<p>We assessed Illumina read quality using FastQC (v.0.11.5, available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Trimmomatic (v.0.36; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]) was used remove Illumina adapters, bases at each end of the read with an average Phred score &#x003C;15 over a 4 bp window, and reads &#x2264;36 basepairs long. Poretools version 0.6.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] was used to assess the quality of each MinION dataset and to generate fastq files from basecalled fast5 files. Barcodes and reads that contained an internal barcode adapter sequence were removed using Porechop version 0.2.3 (available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>). Nanofilt (v.1.0.5, available from, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt">https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt</ext-link>) was used to remove reads shorter than 500 basepairs or having an average quality score &#x003C;9.</p>

<title>Genome Assembly</title>
<p>We used several approaches to construct de novo assemblies of each genome. First, we constructed MiSeq-only short read assemblies using SPAdes (v.3.11.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and Unicycler (v.0.4.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] (v.0.4.3), representing the current state of the art. Second, we added MinION reads to these MiSeq-based assemblies to disambiguate ambiguous regions in the MiSeq sequencing graph, creating SPAdes-hybrid and Unicycler-hybrid assemblies. Third, we constructed MinION-only long-read assemblies using Canu (v.1.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. These MinION-only Canu assemblies were polished using the same MinION reads to create Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies by aligning MinION reads to the Canu assembly using BWA (v.0.7.15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] and Samtools (v.1.3.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], and then using Nanopolish (v.3.2.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] for assembly polishing. A second iteration of Nanopolish was completed for strain Ps JKS002128 but did not significantly improve its accuracy (data not shown), and so this strategy was not pursued further. The Canu assemblies were alternatively polished using MiSeq reads to create Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies. MiSeq reads were aligned to the Canu genome using BWA (v.0.7.15) and Samtools (v.1.3.1) and then Pilon (v.1.22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] was used for assembly polishing. In total, we created seven assemblies for each genome: four based primarily on MiSeq data (SPAdes, Unicycler, SPAdes-hybrid, and Unicycler-hybrid) and three based primarily on MinION data (Canu, Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish, Canu&#x002B;Pilon). All commands used for the computational analyses in this study are included in the Supplementary Material.</p>

<title>Depth of Coverage</title>
<p>MinION data was subsampled from Av JG3, Fs ARS-166-14, and Ps JKS002128 to determine the minimum read depth required to create contiguous MinION-based assemblies. Fast5-formatted reads for each strain were subsampled in the order that they were acquired from the MinION sequencer to achieve 10X, 20X, 30X, 40X, 50X, (for Fs ARS-166-14, Av JG3 and Ps JKS002128), 60X (Fs ARS-166-14 and Ps JKS002128 only), and 70X (Ps JKS002128 only) coverage of the Canu assembly for each strain, calculated using the mean MinION read length for each strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This strategy was used to simulate runs stopped after achieving each level of coverage. All data was processed and assembled using Canu as described above.</p>

<title>Quality assessment</title>
<p>The contiguity and quality of each genome assembly was assessed using Quast (v.4.6.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Because we lacked reference genomes for comparison, we instead assessed the quality of our genomes using two strategies, focusing on the Pseudonocardia genomes for detailed comparison. First, we compared all genome assemblies to each other based on their shared kmer composition using Mash (v2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. These Mash distances were used to construct a phylogeny using Mashtree (v.0.33, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lskatz/mashtree">https://github.com/lskatz/mashtree</ext-link>). Second, we aligned each assembly to their respective Canu&#x002B;Pilon assembly using MUMmer (v3.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] to identify SNPs and indels relative to the Canu&#x002B;Pilon assembly. We selected the Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies as references because of their high contiguity and error profiles that were similar to the MiSeq assemblies. However, we stress that this does not comprise a &#x201C;gold standard&#x201D; comparison and the relative nature of these comparisons.</p>

<title>Biosynthetic gene cluster prediction</title>
<p>Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were annotated in each Ps JKS002128 assembly using antiSMASH (v.4.1.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Fragmented BGCs were annotated by their occurring at contig ends. This likely overestimates the number of fragmented BGCs due to antiSMASH&#x2019;s tendency to conservatively extend BGCs past their true boundaries. Identical BGCs were identified using the ClustCompare pipeline (available from, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/klassenlab/ClustCompare">https://github.com/klassenlab/ClustCompare</ext-link>). Briefly, PfamScan (v.1.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] was used to annotate protein domains encoded by each BGC and these domains were compared to each other using BLASTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. BGCs were considered to be homologous based on their sharing a minimum ClustCompare similarity score of 0.3 calculated using a 70&#x0025; similarity threshold between domains in different BGCs, a minimum of two homologous domains shared between BGCs, and a minimum of 50&#x0025; of the domains in the smaller BGC being homologous to domains in the larger BGC. The resulting homology networks were visualized using Cytoscape (v.3.6.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] to identify clusters of homologous BGCs. Singleton clusters were aligned to the Canu&#x002B;Pilon genome and individual Canu&#x002B;Pilon antiSMASH BGCs using MUMmer v3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>] to identify homologies that occurred at the nucleotide level but not at the protein level (e.g., due to high error rates that might confound gene prediction). Nucleotide-level BGC comparisons were also conducted using Mash (v.2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>

Full and partial IS sequences were identified by comparing each assembly genome sequence to the ISfinder database.

<title>Sequencing</title>
<p>We sequenced the genomes of nine bacterial strains using both Oxford Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq technologies, together spanning a wide range of GC content (<italic>Flavobacterium</italic>: 31&#x0025;; <italic>Aeromonas</italic>: 59-61&#x0025;; <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic>: 74&#x0025;). MinION sequencing coverage ranged from 40-135X and generated median read lengths of 1,629-9,665 bps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Median MinION read lengths for Ah CA-13-1 and Av CIP107763<sup>T</sup> were considerably shorter than for the other MinION libraries due to difficulties in extracting high molecular weight DNA from these strains. Illumina Nextera libraries were sequenced for all <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> strains with coverage ranging from 30-169X (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Preliminary Nextera libraries were also constructed for the <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> strains, but these were highly biased and generated extremely fragmented assemblies (1000s of contigs; data not shown). We therefore instead generated Illumina TruSeq PCR-free libraries for these strains, with coverage ranging from 71-246X (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome Assembly</title>
<p>Seven assemblies were generated for each strain, four based on MiSeq data either alone (SPAdes, Unicycler) or with MinION data to deconvolute the MiSeq assembly graph (SPAdes-hybrid, Unicycler-hybrid), and three based on MinION data either alone (Canu), polished using the same MinION data (Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish), or polished using MiSeq data (Canu&#x002B;Pilon). Both the SPAdes and Unicycler assemblies had the largest number of contigs out of all assemblies generated for each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These assemblies also typically had the lowest N50 values compared to the other assemblies. Ah CA-13-1 and Av CIP107763<sup>T</sup> were exceptions to this trend, likely due to their lower quality MinION libraries. The addition of MinION reads to deconvolute the SPAdes and Unicycler assembly graphs lowered the number of contigs and increased the N50 for all assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This highlights the ability of long MinION reads to resolve genomic repeats that otherwise stymied assembly of these genomes from short reads. Unicycler consistently outperformed SPAdes during hybrid assembly (the only exception being Av CIP107763<sup>T</sup>) but not when assembling MiSeq reads only.</p>

<p>Canu assemblies were more contiguous and had higher N50 values than all MiSeq-based assemblies, except for Av CIP107763<sup>T</sup> Unicycler-hybrid and SPAdes-hybrid assemblies and the Ah CA-13-1 Unicycler-hybrid assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, B). These two strains had lower quality MinION libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) that likely compromised the Canu assemblies, even if they were still more contiguous than the MiSeq-only SPAdes and Unicycler assemblies. Canu assemblies were used as the base for polishing with either Nanopolish or Pilon, and so the number of contigs was the same for the Canu, Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish, and Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The Canu assembly sizes were greater than those of any MiSeq-based assembly for all <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> and <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> strains (up for &#x007E;14&#x0025; for Ps JKS002128; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), likely reflecting the MinION&#x2019;s ability to overcome biases in the Illumina libraries for these genomes with low (31&#x0025;) and high (74&#x0025;) GC content, respectively. This was not true for the <italic>Aeromonas</italic> assemblies, likely reflecting fewer biases in the Illumina libraries for these strains with more moderate GC content (59-61&#x0025;). Taken together, these assemblies demonstrate that MinION sequencing improves assembly contiguity, especially where Illumina sequencing libraries are the most biased.</p>

<title>Assembly Accuracy</title>
<p>Because we lacked high-quality reference genomes for our strains, we instead used several comparative analyses to assess the accuracy of our assemblies. We focused on <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> for these analyses because these appeared to be the most challenging to assemble based on the substantial differences in their assembly sizes and contiguities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We used Mash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] to compare all of our <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> assemblies to each other according to their shared k-mer content and to construct a distance-based phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Canu assemblies were the least similar to the MiSeq-based assemblies, followed by the Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies. This suggests that MinION data alone cannot produce accurate <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> assemblies using current technologies. These data might alternatively be interpreted to mean that the MiSeq-based assemblies have lower accuracy compared to the Canu and Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies, but we consider this unlikely based on previous research that argues against this interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies were more similar to the MiSeq-based assemblies, suggesting that polishing MinION-based assemblies with MiSeq reads is an effective strategy to generate microbial genome assemblies that are both accurate and contiguous. However, some divergence was observed between the Canu&#x002B;Pilon and MiSeq-based genome assemblies. This was especially true for Ps JKS002128, which appeared to have the most biased MiSeq library in our study based on differences in the sizes of the MiSeq-based and MinION-based assemblies for this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These differences are consistent with the existence of regions in the Canu assembly that lacked mapping MiSeq reads, leaving these regions uncorrected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. All genome assemblies for the same strain clustered together in the Mashtree analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that even the high error rates of the Canu and Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies did not obscure strain-level phylogenetic differences.</p>

<p>Based on the Mash analysis, the Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies were used as a reference against which to compare the other assemblies based on their higher contiguity and substantial accuracy. The high accuracy of MiSeq sequencing meant that all MiSeq-based assemblies had few SNPs and Indels relative to the Canu&#x002B;Pilon assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the Canu assemblies had many more SNPs and indels relative to the Canu&#x002B;Pilon assembly, especially for Ps JKS002056 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Polishing these Canu assemblies using Nanopolish reduced the number of indels, and the number of SNPs to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the numbers of SNPs and indels were still much higher than for the MiSeq-based assemblies.</p>

<title>MinION Sequencing Depth</title>
<p>Canu assemblies were performed using 5-7 different levels of coverage for strains Av JG3, Fs ARS-166-14, and Ps JKS002128. These assemblies suggest that the amount of coverage needed for a high-quality MinION-based genome assembly is relatively low, but also depends somewhat on the complexity of each genome. Assemblies for strains Av JG3 and Fs ARS-166-14 did not improve substantially above 30X coverage, consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. However, assemblies for strain Ps JKS002128 improved incrementally up to 70X coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that higher coverage may be necessary for genomes with high GC content. Even though they were assembled into a few contigs, these assemblies were not error-free based on the different genome sizes and N50 values obtained for assemblies using different high-coverage datasets. The single 50X Av JG3 assembly also lacked a plasmid that was present in assemblies for the lower coverage datasets (data not known). Researchers should therefore assess their goals for MinION sequencing before progressing with a run and consider stopping data collection at a certain threshold to conserve flow cells and to decrease sequencing time and cost.</p>

<title>Biosynthetic gene cluster prediction</title>
<p>One expected benefit of high quality genome assemblies is that they will substantially improve the annotation of repetitive genomic regions relative to lower quality assemblies. To test this, we compared antiSMASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) annotations for all of our Ps JKS002128 assemblies. Actinobacteria such as <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> typically possess many BGCs, although they are often difficult to assemble correctly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. AntiSMASH consistently predicted 12 and 13 BGCs for the SPAdes and Unicycler assembles, respectively, and 12 BGCs for both the SPAdes-hybrid and Unicycler-hybrid assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The extra BGC in the Unicycler assembly is due to there being two separate fragments of BGC 1 annotated in this assembly. More BGCs were predicted for the Canu (17), Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish (19), and Canu&#x002B;Pilon (18) assemblies, including 4 BGCs that were found in at least two of these genomes but not in any of the MiSeq-based genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These BGCs may lie at particularly repetitive or bias-prone regions of the Ps JKS002128 genome such that they are omitted from MiSeq-based assemblies but present in MinION-based assemblies that are much less sensitive to these issues. Despite their greater contiguity, the Canu, Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish, and Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies lacked some combination of BGCs 1, 9, 12, and 13, all of which were found in all of the MiSeq-based assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The Canu assembly lacked all 4 of these BGCs, the Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assembly lacked BGCs 9, 12, and 13, and the Canu&#x002B;Pilon assembly only lacked BGC 13. These omissions are likely due to gene prediction errors that decreased the ability of antiSMASH to detect these BGCs. Such errors may have also been responsible for the prediction of BGCs 18 and 19 solely in the Canu and Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which are likely false positive annotations based on these BGCs only appearing in individual error-prone assemblies. MinION-based genome assemblies therefore substantially increase the sensitivity of BGC annotation, but require polishing to limit annotation errors.</p>

<p>Improved genome assembly also reduced the number of BGCs that were fragmented, i.e., that overlapped with a contig end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Approximately half of all BGCs in the SPAdes and Unicycler assemblies were fragmented, reflecting the inability of short-read Illumina data to resolve these repetitive genomic regions. The Unicycler hybrid, and to a lesser extent the SPAdes hybrid, assemblies produced fewer fragmented BGCs, reflecting the increased contiguity of these assemblies. The Canu, Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish, and Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies all had very few fragmented BGCs, based on BGCs overlapping with contig ends. MinION-based genome assemblies therefore do not only increase the frequency of BGC detection, but also more completely assemble these BGCs and thus increase their value for genome-guided drug discovery. The Canu, Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish, and Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies did have several annotated gene clusters that were aggregated into a single BGC in other assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Whether these represent single BGCs that were fragmented in the MinION-based assemblies or multiple BGCs that were located adjacent to each other on the Ps JKS002128 genome is difficult to predict computationally.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Single-molecule, long-read sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION have strong potential to revolutionize the sequencing and de novo assembly of bacterial genomes. Existing short-read sequencing technologies frequently produce genome assemblies that are broken into 10s-100s of contigs, such as in our assemblies generated using only short-read MiSeq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Fragmented genome assemblies prevent accurate annotation of important genome features such as insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Technological improvements are therefore necessary to fully understand and exploit these genomic features to cure disease and foster biotechnology.</p>
<p>One key reason for poor genome assembly is the inherently limited length of short-reads. By increasing the read length, long-read sequencing technologies such as the MinION disambiguate genomic repeats and generate fewer contig breaks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]). This was clearly evident from our SPAdes- and Unicycler-hybrid assemblies, where the long MinION reads were able to deconvolute the assembly graph produced from the MiSeq data and yielded fewer and longer contigs compared to the MiSeq-only assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Such improvements are likely to continue as MinION-compatible extraction methods for high-molecular weight DNA are refined.</p>
<p>However, this approach assumes that the entire genome is represented in the Illumina sequencing graph, which may not be true because of biases in short-read sequencing library preparation. As a result, some regions of the genome are sequenced to low coverage or excluded entirely, resulting in assembly fragmentation due to missing data. These problems include PCR biases against extreme &#x0025;GC sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and due to biased insertion of transposases during library preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Reflecting such biases, our initial <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> sequencing experiments that used the Illumina Nextera library preparation method (which includes both transposases and PCR) produced genome assemblies with 1,000s of contigs (data not shown), compared to the 10s-100s of <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> contigs produced using Illumina TruSeq PCR-free libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Single-molecule sequencing methods such as the MinION avoid many of these biases by sequencing individual template DNA molecules without using PCR. This is reflected by the higher contiguity of our <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> Canu genome assemblies compared to the SPAdes- and Unicycler-hybrid assemblies that used MinION reads to deconvolute the potentially biased Illumina assembly graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All of our <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> and <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> Canu assemblies are also larger than those based on Illumina reads, reflecting the inclusion of sequences that were missing from the Illumina sequencing libraries. For <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic>, these differences were sometimes substantial (up to a 13.7&#x0025; increase in genome size). These results point to library preparation bias as a second source of error common to short-read sequencing that can be overcome by long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies such as the MinION, in addition to the ability of MinION reads to span long genomic repeats.</p>
<p>Our results also highlight the importance of efficient high molecular weight DNA extraction methods for MinION sequencing. Of the 9 genomes that we sequenced during this study, the two with the lowest median read length (Ah CA-13-1 and Av CIP107763<sup>T</sup>) produced the least contiguous Canu assemblies (14 and 32 contigs, respectively). However, this is still more contiguous than the MiSeq-only SPAdes and Unicycler assemblies for these strains. MinION reads also improved these SPAdes and Unicycler assemblies when run in hybrid mode, demonstrating the utility of long reads even if DNA extraction remains suboptimal. There is a current need for reliable protocols to produce high molecular weight genomic DNA that is compatible with the MinION sequencer, and the Oxford Nanopore Voltrax and Ubik devices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/clive-g-brown-cto-plenary-london-calling">https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/clive-g-brown-cto-plenary-london-calling</ext-link>) show strong potential to overcome these issues. The degree to which such devices are compatible with diverse cell wall chemistries remains to be validated.</p>
<p>Although most of our MinION-based assemblies were more contiguous than the MiSeq-based assemblies, they were less accurate. Assemblies generated using Canu contained a large number of SNP and indels relative to our Illumina-based assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). These differences were reduced by using Nanopolish to correct the Canu assembly using MinION reads, and even better results were obtained using Pilon to correct the Canu assembly using MiSeq reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, differences still existed between these polished assemblies and the Illumina assemblies in some cases (most obviously for Pseudonocardia sp. JKS002128). Although it is possible that the MiSeq assemblies contained errors relative to the MinION assemblies, this would be inconsistent with previous work comparing MinION assemblies to high-quality reference genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Illumina reads are also unable to correct repetitive genome sequences that cannot be unambiguously mapped using short reads, and so these regions will be uncorrected even in Canu&#x002B;Pilon assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. A tradeoff therefore exists between the higher contiguity of MinION-based assemblies relative to their higher number of SNP and indel errors. Minimizing such errors is a current technological focus of ONT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/clive-g-brown-cto-plenary-london-calling">https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/clive-g-brown-cto-plenary-london-calling</ext-link>) and so this tradeoff may lessen in the near future.</p>
<p>The importance of these assembly trade-offs is highlighted by our analysis of repetitive genomic regions. For example, antiSMASH annotated &#x007E;1/3 more secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in the MinION-based assemblies of <italic>Pseudonocardia</italic> sp. JKS002128 compared to the MiSeq-based assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), confirming our previous observations that BGCs are poorly resolved by Illumina sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Similar results were obtained when annotating insertion sequences in <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> sp. Fs ARS-166-14, as expected due to the highly repetitive nature of these genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The BGCs that were annotated in the Illumina-only assemblies were highly fragmented, highlighting the challenge of sequencing these complex genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, the genome assemblies that contained the highest number of SNP and indel errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) contained several BGCs that were unique to those particular genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and lacked several BGCs that were annotated in the MiSeq-based assemblies. These differences are likely due to the difficulty in accurately predicting gene structures in highly error-prone genomes due to gene truncation or misplaced start sites. Indeed, our initial ClustCompare analysis to compare BGCs based on their protein sequences did not detect many true homologies between BGCs annotated in the Canu and Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies to those annotated in assemblies that were generated or polished using MiSeq data due to the large number of misannotated gene structures in the Canu and Canu&#x002B;Nanopolish assemblies (data not shown). These homologies only became clear using comparisons between nucleotide sequences. High numbers of SNP and indel errors can therefore prevent accurate genome annotation due to errors in gene structure prediction. Several homologous BGCs were also annotated as having different biosynthetic classes in different genomes (represented by the different colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Together, these analyses highlight the importance of contiguous and accurate genome assemblies for the prediction of repetitive elements such as BGCs, and highlight the utility of MinION sequencing in this application, especially when polished using accurate Illumina reads.</p>
<p>In summary, our data highlights the ability of long-read, single-molecule MinION sequencing to overcome current limitations of short-read sequencing, particularly its inability to disambiguate repetitive genome regions and avoid biases introduced during library preparation. Overcoming these limitations greatly improves the annotation of many clinically-and biotechnologically-important genomic regions such as insertion sequences and BGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). However, SNP and indel errors remain problematic in de novo assemblies generated from MinION data. This is likely to improve in the near future given the extensive research underway in this area. Because twelve microbial genomes can currently be sequenced to sufficient coverage (40-50X; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) on a single MinION or MiSeq flowcell, combining these data currently requires &#x007E;&#x0024;100-&#x0024;200 for the MinION and &#x007E;&#x0024;150 for Illumina sequencing in reagent and consumable costs per genome. Combining these two data types is therefore an affordable means to dramatically increase the quality of any bacterial de <italic>novo</italic> genome assembly, regardless of their genome complexity or &#x0025;GC content, and compares favorably to the cost of PacBio sequencing. Future technical advances will likely decrease these costs further, and we anticipate that highly contiguous and accurate de <italic>novo</italic> assembly of bacterial genomes will become standard in the field in the very near future.</p>
