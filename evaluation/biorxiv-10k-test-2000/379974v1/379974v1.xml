<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Here we explore how mutating different sequences in an enhancer that regulates patterned gene expression in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos can affect its output. We used quantitative imaging to analyze the effects of a wide variety of mutations in the <italic>hunchback</italic> distal anterior enhancer. This enhancer has been shown to respond to the anterior morphogen Bicoid, but we found that mutations in only one of the five strong Bicoid sites in the enhancer has a significant effect on its binding. The pioneer factor Zelda, which binds to this enhancer and is the only other factor implicated in its activity besides Bicoid. However, we found that mutations of all its sites only has modest effect that is limited to reduction of its output in more posterior regions of the embryo, where Bicoid levels are low. In contrast to the modest effects of mutating known transcription factor binding sites, randomizing the sequences between Zelda and Bicoid sites significantly compromised enhancer activity. Finer mapping suggested that the sequences that determine activity are broadly distributed in the enhancer. Mutations in short sequences flanking Bicoid binding sites have stronger effects than mutations to Bicoid sites themselves, highlighting the complex and counterintuitive nature of the relationship between enhancer sequence and activity.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Precise spatiotemporal gene expression in animal development is mediated by the binding of sequence-specific, DNA binding transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences known as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). Since their discovery more than three decades ago (J. Banerji, S. Rusconi, W. Schaffner, 1981) tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the structure and function of enhancers. However, they remain highly enigmatic: it is difficult to identify enhancer sequences <italic>de novo</italic> based on their sequence alone, let alone predict their transcriptional output.</p>
<p>One of the major, outstanding challenges in understanding enhancers is our limited knowledge of what makes a sequence function as an enhancer. Because transcription factors recognize short, redundant DNA sequences, potential transcription factor binding sites are found throughout animal genomes. Yet only a small fraction of sites for any given factor are bound <italic>in vivo</italic> and are involved in transcriptional regulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Many hypotheses have been offered to explain why only a small fraction of the sequences containing transcription factor binding sites function as enhancers, including the number of binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mirny, 2010</xref>), the organization and orientation of binding sites to facilitate cooperative interactions between factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jolma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Panne et al., 2007</xref>), and various forms of indirect cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miller and Widom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mirny, 2010</xref>). It is now clear that some factors, known as pioneer factors, can potentiate the binding of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>; Zaret and Mango, 2016) and various, recent studies have also suggested that sequence features other than transcription factor binding sites may play a role in enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Slattery et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we explore these questions using one of the simpler enhancers active in early <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> development, the distal anterior enhancer (DAE) of <italic>hunchback (hb)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). The DAE is expressed in a broad anterior pattern in cellular blastoderm (pre-gastrulation) stage embryos, and is believed to be regulated by the anterior morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Driever and N&#x00FC;sslein-Volhard, 1988</xref>), which has thirteen sites in the enhancer, and by the maternal pioneer factor Zelda (Zid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</xref>), which has five. Here we explore the role of these binding sites and other sequences on DAE activity through quantitative imaging of the transcriptional output of several mutations in the DAE.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>To test the effect of mutations on the DAE enhancer activity, we developed a reporter system in which we embedded the enhancer in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the <italic>even-skipped (eve)</italic> gene and all of its regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Venken et al., 2009</xref>), as well as the two insulators flanking the <italic>eve</italic> gene locus, which are important for proper function of the enhancers in this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fujioka et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our goal was to assay enhancer activity away from its endogenous locus, where other elements might alter its activity, but within the context of a complete gene, rather than using a conventional system with only an enhancer, promoter and reporter gene.</p>

In the eve-eGFP construct, the CDS of <italic>eve</italic> gene was replaced by the reporter gene eGFP. To create the reporter vector construct eve-eGFP/S2xAmp<sup>r</sup>-S1xgalK, the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 and 1 enhancers were further replaced by the bacteria Amp<sup>r</sup> gene, and the bacteria galK gene, respectively. To create an enhancer reporter construct, e.g. eve-eGFP/S2xAmp<sup>r</sup>-S1x(hb-DAE), the galK sequence in the <italic>eve</italic> bac reporter vector was replaced with the enhancer sequences of interest through recombineering.

</fig>
<p>We first replaced the <italic>eve</italic> coding sequence in the BAC with an eGFP reporter gene, and then replaced the two anterior <italic>eve</italic> stripes, stripe 1 and stripe 2, with galK and Amp<sup>r</sup>. These latter two modifications eliminated any activity from the BAC that overlaps the region where the DAE is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then replaced galK with the wild-type DAE and various modified versions by BAC recombineering, and generated fly lines containing these constructs. As expected, the construct containing the wild-type DAE expresses in the anterior during early mitotic cycle 14 (c14A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Perry et al., 2011</xref>), and is generally absent after mid-cycle 14 (c14C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The activity of the enhancer constructs we report in the remainder of study were all measured in cycle 14A embryos.</p>

<title>Mutations of Bcd binding sites on <italic>hb</italic> DAE activity</title>
<p>To begin to understand the requirements for the DAE activity, we first focused on the role of potential transcription factor binding sites.</p>
<p>The DAE drives a similar expression pattern to the promoter proximal enhancer of hb(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Perry et al., 2011</xref>), for which Bcd is known as the primary activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tautz, 1988</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Driever and N&#x00FC;sslein-Volhard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>). So we expect Bcd is the major activator of the DAE as well. In addition, we found Zid, the maternal factor known to be broadly required for zygotic enhancer function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liang et al., 2008</xref>), bound strongly to this enhancer based on previous ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>), and thus may be important as well. Besides these two factors, we found no other activator in the early embryo transcription network that was consistent with the broad anterior expression pattern displayed by the DAE, with the exception of <italic>hb</italic> itself. <italic>hb</italic> can function as an activator, as was first shown for the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Small et al., 1991</xref>). However, in a previous ChIP-chip study, <italic>hb</italic> did not bind strongly to the DAE enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>) and is thus unlikely to contribute to its activity. Therefore, Bcd and Zid are likely to be the main activators of the DAE.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of Bcd binding sites in <italic>hb</italic> DAE function, we started by identifying the Bcd motifs in the DAE sequence using the patser program(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hertz and Stormo, 1999</xref>). A low stringency cutoff in the motif search was used to ensure that all potentially functional Bcd motifs were identified. For comparison, using the same cutoff parameters, we were able to identify all previously identified Bcd sites in two well studied enhancers including the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Small et al., 1992</xref>) and the <italic>hb</italic> promoter proximal enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Driever and N&#x00FC;sslein-Volhard, 1989</xref>), as well as multiple additional weaker sites: three for <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2, and five for the <italic>hb</italic> proximal enhancer. This demonstrates the cutoff we used is more than adequate to identify all functionally significant Bcd sites.</p>
<p>We made six single and double mutations covering five these motifs, including the four strongest motifs found in this enhancer sequence, and tested their effect on the reporter activity in the embryos of their corresponding transgenic flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that among all the mutant enhancers tested, only B1 single site mutated enhancer and the B1 and B2 double site mutated enhancer caused significant decrease in the enhancer activity compared to the wild type enhancer. The activities of these two mutant enhancers are very similar, which, combined with the observation that the other two double site mutants involving B2 did not have significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggests that mutation of the B1 site is mainly responsible for the effect observed for the B1 and B2 double mutant, and the B2 site does not seem to play a important role in DAE activity. Taken together, among the five Bcd sites mutated, only one site, B1, showed significant effect on the DAE activity. This result is very surprising, and suggests that this enhancer harbors an excess of Bcd sites, which presumably is important to ensure robustness of the enhancer against mutational perturbation.</p>

<title>Zid is only partially required for <italic>hb</italic> DAE activity and fails to convert Bcd binding site enriched sequences into enhancers</title>
<p>We next investigated the effect of Zid binding sites on the DAE activity. Using patser at low cutoff, we identified five Zid motifs in the enhancer sequence. We, then created a mutant enhancer with mutations at all these motifs, except the one that is very weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that these mutations had relatively modest effect on the DAE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), and interestingly, while the mutant enhancer displayed significant lower activity toward the posterior part of the DAE expression pattern, there was no effect in the anterior part of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig, 3C</xref>). The lack of general requirement for Zid for the activity of this enhancer is surprising, but consistent with a model in which Bcd enhancers active further away from the embryo&#x2019;s anterior are often more dependent on Zid due to the presence of low Bcd concentration in those cells in the Bcd morphogen gradient, while those that are active close to the anterior, where Bcd concentration is high, are less dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="379974_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The seemingly simple requirement for the DAE activity, just a mere combination of Bcd and Zid sites, is very interesting since there are a large number of genomic regions that are enriched with Bcd binding sites but do not function as enhancers and are not bound by Bcd <italic>in vivo</italic> based on ChIP studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). We wondered whether Zid can convert these sequences enriched for Bcd sites, which presumably contain less than the adequate number and arrangement of Bcd sites, to active enhancers.</p>
<p>To test the above possibility, we selected two genomic sequences that have six and eleven Bcd sites respectively, and cloned them into the reporter vector with or without additional Zid sites added to the sequences. We inserted the Zid motif containing sequences from <italic>hb</italic> sites into the sequences in such a way so as to make the arrangements of Zid motifs relative to Bcd motifs somewhat similar to those present in the <italic>hb</italic> DAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref>). It is worth noting that even though one of these sequences has fewer Bcd sites than <italic>hb</italic> DAE, based on our analysis of known Bcd target enhancers, we found that <italic>hb</italic> DAE possesses the highest number of Bcd sites, and many enhancers have, and can function with, relatively few Bcd sites. After reporter activity was analyzed in the embryos of transgenic flies created with these constructs, we found that neither the original sequences nor the derivatives with the Zid site added displayed any activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B and S1C</xref>). This adds to a list of failed examples from previous attempts to convert genomic sequences enriched with Bcd motifs into active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), even though a combination of limited number of Zid sites and other activator binding sites was able to activate reporter expression in simpler constructs in which those binding sites were placed direct upstream of a promoter that drives the reporter expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Crocker et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>The DNA sequences between transcription factor binding sites are crucial for <italic>hb</italic> DAE enhancer activity</title>
<p>The results presented above as a whole are very puzzling: on the one hand the activity of the native enhancer was only modestly affected or not affected at all by mutations in its transcription factor binding sites, while on the other hand, adding strong Zid binding sites to sequences that would appear to contain the adequate number of Bcd sites failed to convert them into active enhancers. While this may be due to lack of proper arrangement of the motifs in the non-enhancer sequences, among other possibilities, we contemplated the possibility that enhancer sequences besides transcription factor binding sites may also be important for enhancer activity.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="379974_figS1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To investigate the above hypothesis, we decided to test the effect of mutating sequences around transcription factor binding sites. As mentioned above, Bcd and Zid are likely to be the major, if not sole activators of the DAE. In addition, based on ChIP-chip studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">MacArthur et al., 2009</xref>), this enhancer is also bound by Giant (Gt) and Tailless (Tll). These two factors are repressors, and thus are of lesser significance in our analysis. Nevertheless, we took the Gt sites into consideration in our mutational analysis.</p>
<p>We created two mutant enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4A</xref>). For the first, hb-DAE(Rd), we kept the core motif sequences of Zid, Bcd and Gt in the enhancer and replaced the sequences in between with randomly selected sequences of same length. For the other, hb-DAE(TBS), the non-transcription factor binding site sequences were altered by swapping the top and bottom strand bases for each base pair. The mutant enhancers were inserted into <italic>eve</italic> bac reporter and their activities were tested in the embryos of their transgenic flies. Surprisingly, these mutant enhancers displayed dramatically decreased activity compared to the wild type - with up to about thirty fold decrease for hb-DAE(Rd) and about eight fold for hb-DAE(TBS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4B-E</xref>). This result suggests that the sequences between the transcription factor binding sites are important for <italic>hb</italic> DAE enhancer activity.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="379974_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To see whether the importance of non-transcription factor binding sequences is limited to the <italic>hb</italic> DAE, we carried out similar analysis with the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goto et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Small et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stanojevic et al., 1991</xref>). We chose to use an expanded version of the enhancer that include additional sequences upstream and downstream of the previously defined minimal stripe 2 enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Small et al., 1992</xref>). This enhancer is bound by more transcription factors, which include Bcd, Hb, Kruppel (Kr), Gt, and Zid based on previous studies and a published and ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Small et al., 1992</xref>). In addition, previous ChIP-chip data suggests that Tll, the terminal repressor, may also be important for <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>), but was not considered in the following experiment. Again using the patser program, we identified the binding sites of these factors. For Bcd, Hb, Kr, and Gt the identified motifs included all the sites revealed by previous biochemical and mutational studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Small et al., 1992</xref>), with the exception of two Gt sites that were identified by sequence match to the consensus motif but were shown to have no effect on <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer activity when mutated(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnosti et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, other, weaker motifs for Bcd and Kr that were not described in previous studies were also identified. Thus, we are confident that we identified all the binding sites for these factors, and likely for Zid as well, even though no information for Zid on this enhancer was previously available.</p>
<p>We have created mutated <italic>eve</italic> stripe enhancers either by replacing the sequences between the transcription factor binding sites with random sequences (eve-S2(Rd)) or swapping the top and bottom bases for each base pair of the sequences between the sites (eve-S2(TBS)) as we did for the <italic>hb</italic> DAE. Analysis of the reporter activities in the embryos from the transgenes of these mutant enhancer constructs showed that the activity of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer is completely abolished after these changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). At the same time, the eve-S2(Rd) displayed a broad domain of expression in the anterior part of the embryo. This ectopic activity may be explained by the fact that the binding sites of Til, which are likely to be largely responsible for repressing <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer activity in the anterior part of the embryo, were mutated in this mutant enhancer. The strong activity in the anterior part of the embryo was not observed for the TBS mutant enhancer. This can be explained by the fact that Til motif is dyad-symmetric, and as a result the top/bottom strand base conversion often conserved the Til binding motif. In all, these results showed that the alteration of sequences between the transcription factor binding motifs had a strong, detrimental effect on <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer activity. The fact that the sequence randomization mutant displayed enhancer activity in the anterior part of the embryos suggests that the randomization only weakened but did not abolish the capacity of the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer to function. This weaker effect compared to what was observed for <italic>hb</italic> DAE mutants may be due to the presence of large number of transcription factor motifs present in this enhancer and as a result, a smaller percentage of the enhancer sequence was changed. Nevertheless, this result showed that the sequences between transcription factor binding sites are important for <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 enhancer as well. This result is similar to a previous report, in which a synthetic enhancer containing all transcription factor binding sites for <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 failed to activate transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vincent et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>The non-transcription factor binding site sequences important for DAE activity are broadly distributed</title>
<p>One possible explanation for the observed effect caused by mutations in the sequences between known transcription factor binding sites is the existence of in those sequences of binding sites for certain known or unknown factor(s). If this is true, it would be possible to identify them by mutating smaller segment of the DAE.</p>
<p>To investigate the above possibility, we divided the 5&#x2019; part of the DAE sequence into &#x007E;200 bp regions, and replaced the sequences between transcription factor binding sites in each of these regions with random sequences and kept the rest of the enhancer sequence unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We found that mutations in first two regions strongly decreased the enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The sequence changes in the 170 bp region that followed had a relatively small positive effect, leading to an expansion of the expressed domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5B</xref>), which probably is due to the mutation of certain repressor binding site(s) located in the region. It is worth noting that the first 400 bp of the DAE sequence already contains most of the transcription factor binding sites, so the small effect observed for the mutations in the 170 bp region is not surprising.</p>

<p>To further identify the sequences that may be important, we made four consecutive 50 bp randomization constructs located between positions 77 &#x2013; 290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Analyses of the reporter activities in the transgenes of these constructs showed that three of the four, Rd-50A-C, had similar strong effect while the fourth, Rd-50D, had a small but significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results again suggest that the non-transcription factor binding site sequences important for <italic>hb</italic> DAE activity are broadly distributed. These results are also surprising when compared to the effects of Bcd binding site mutations described above. In particular, in the three regions 50A-C, there are four Bcd sites, with two in 50A, one in 50B, and one in 50C. As shown above, among these Bcd sites, only mutation of B1 in 50A decreased the DAE activity, while mutations in of B2, also in 50A, and B3, the only Bcd site in region 50B had no effect. The 50C region has only one weak Bcd site, which is probably dispensable for DAE activity as well if mutated. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the sequences between Bcd binding sites are broadly required for DAE activity, and significantly, the changes of these sequences in small regions can have strong effects on the DAE activity even as mutations of Bcd sites in those regions often do not.</p>

<title>The importance of the non-TFBS sequences can only be partly attributed to the weakly preferred bases flanking the Bcd core motifs</title>
<p>The flanking sequences of the core motifs of transcription factors can have a significant effect in modulating their binding affinity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Farley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gord&#x00E2;n et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Levo et al., 2015</xref>). The extent of the effect, as revealed in previous studies, depends on the factor and how the &#x201C;core&#x201D; motif is defined. Bcd has two weakly preferred base pairs upstream of the &#x201C;core motif&#x201D; in its full DNA binding matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The flanking sequences of the Zid &#x201C;core&#x201D; motif are longer, but the preference is extremely weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Importantly, relatively few bases upstream of the Bcd motifs were changed from the wild type in the hb-DAE(Rd) mutant construct, and among those with changes, the number of sites where favored bases were changed into unfavored bases based on the Bcd binding site is similar to the number of instances where unfavored bases were changed into favored ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). In addition, in the 50B and 50C mutant constructs which had lower activity than the wild type DAE, the two flanking bases pairs of the Bcd sites are the same as in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Therefore, lower activities of 50B and 50C mutant are not due to changes of the two flanking base pairs of the Bcd motifs in those regions.</p>

<p>To more critically assess the role of the sequences between the transcription factor binding sites in the enhancer activity and address the contribution of the weakly preferred bases around the Zid and Bcd binding sites, we created a new construct hb-DAE(Rd-f), in which only the sequences between the &#x201C;full&#x201D; Bcd, Zid, and Gt motifs were replaced with the corresponding random sequences from hb-DAE(Rd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref> shows that this mutant enhancer displayed higher activity then the original hb-DAE(Rd) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>).

<title>Sequence alignment between different drosophila species reveals conserved sequence blocks</title>
<p>The results shown above demonstrate that sequences between Zid, Bcd, and Gt sites are important for the DAE activity and the effect is broadly distributed. This suggests that the mutational effect probably is not due to the loss of binding site(s) for a certain factor, since if such factor existed, it would need to be able to bind to, and consequently have binding site present in each of the 50 regions, which we find is not true.</p>
<p>Regardless whether factor binding is important between the known transcription factors for the DAE activity, analysis of sequence conservation between different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species can aid the identification of potential transcription factor binding sites and other sequences important for enhancer activity. We therefore carried out sequence alignment for <italic>hb</italic> DAE sequences from the twelve sequenced <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. This analysis revealed conserved blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5</xref>). Most these conserved sequences correspond to binding sites for Zid, Bcd, and Gt (which were taken into consideration in the current study and two other known factors, Til and Knirps (Kni) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Both Til and Kni are repressors, thus mutation of their binding sites were not expected to negatively affected enhancer activity as we observed by mutating the sequences between Zid, Bcd, and Gt.</p>
<p>There are several other highly conserved, unknown sequence blocks (un1-4) between the transcription factor binding sites. Some extensively conserved sequences were also found around several of the Bcd binding sites. These conserved sequences do not correspond to the preferred dinucleotides upstream of the Bcd core motif and differ between different Bcd motifs. We attempted to find matches for these conserved sequences to known motifs in the combined fly factor database by TomTom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meme-suite.org/tools/tomtom">http://meme-suite.org/tools/tomtom</ext-link>) but were unable to find any matches. Besides this lack of match to known motifs, it is also important that none of the conserved sequence motif that appeared more than once and could potentially explain the broad distribution of the mutational effect as discussed above. Thus, different types of sequences between Zid, Bcd, and Gt binding sites may be important for the <italic>hb</italic> DAE activity. It is likely that most if not all of these conserved blocks do not function as transcription factor binding sites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our in depth analysis of <italic>hb</italic> DAE enhancer revealed that, strikingly, while mutations in Bcd and Zid binding sites often had at most modest effects on its activity, the mutations of the sequences between binding sites of these two factors and Gt strongly decreased its activity. This later finding suggested that sequences between the known transcription factors Zid, Bcd, and Gt are important for the activity of the DAE. This is quite surprising since this enhancer is very similar to <italic>hb</italic> promoter proximal enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Perry et al., 2011</xref>), which is well known to be primarily activated by Bcd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Driever et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>), and Zid and Bcd were expected to be all that is required for <italic>hb</italic> DAE mediated activation.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for the loss of DAE activity upon mutations of the sequences between Zid, Bcd, and Gt sites is that those sequences contain the binding sites of a certain unknown factor(s). We consider this unlikely for several reasons. First of all, such factor needs to be expressed broadly to at least cover the anterior half of the embryo where the DAE is active. Within the transcription network of the early fly embryo, only <italic>hb</italic> itself meets this expression pattern criteria, and can function as an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Small et al., 1991</xref>). However, the DAE does not contain <italic>hb</italic> binding sites and is not bound significantly by <italic>hb</italic> based on ChIP data (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>)). In addition, the Gaf factor is expressed ubiquitously and its binding motif is enriched among enhancer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Y&#x00E1;&#x00F1;ez-Cuna et al., 2014</xref>). However, <italic>hb</italic> DAE does not contain the GAGA motif for the Gaf factor either. We also tried to find potential transcription factor binding sites by finding conserved sequences outside Zid, Bcd, and Gt sites, and matching them known motifs in the fly factor database, but we failed to find any except for matches to known repressors, Kni and Til, which may modulate the activity of this enhancer through repression. The conserved sequences identified by the alignment analysis are also very diverse, and none of them was present at more than one location in the DAE to be able to explain the broad requirement for the sequences between the known transcription factors revealed in the mutational analyses. Take all this consideration, we favor the possibility that the sequences between the transcription factor binding sites do not provide binding site information for transcription factors, but instead may play some other functional roles in determining the DAE activity.</p>
<p>Even though, our finding that the sequences between transcription factor binding sites are broadly required for enhancer activity is quite surprising, some previous studies have indicated that non-transcription factor binding sequences can be important and can affect enhancer activity in various ways. One way the enhancer sequences can affect enhancer activity is by influencing nucleosome occupany and positioning. In this regard, it is known that yeast promoters are often associated with the nucleosome-destabilizing poly(dA-dT) track, which is important for transcriptional activation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Iyer and Struhl, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Raveh-Sadka et al., 2012</xref>). In fly and mammals, the enhancers are generally associated with high nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tillo and Hughes, 2009</xref>), which may be related to the high GC content of enhancer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>). The high nucleosome occupancy is likely to have functional consequences for enhancer activity. Interestingly, it was found that for the hematopoietic pioneer factor Pu.1 bound enhancers, the DNA sequence and shape features that determine the binding of this factor and the nucleosome occupancy are highly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barozzi et al., 2014</xref>), which also suggests functional role of sequences between transcription factors.</p>
<p>Some other studies have shown that transcription factor binding affinity and specificity can be affected by DNA shape of the sequences around the transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gord&#x00E2;n et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Slattery et al., 2014</xref>). This may represent another important way sequences outside transcription factor binding motifs can affect transcription factor binding and enhancer activity. Moreover, it has been shown recently that enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are enriched with dinucleotide repeats, such as CACA repeats, which are important for enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Y&#x00E1;&#x00F1;ez-Cuna et al., 2014</xref>), although how the these repetitive sequence affect enhancer activity is unclear.</p>
<p>For the <italic>hb</italic> DAE, it is conceivable that the conserved sequences flanking the Bcd sites may influence Bcd binding by affecting the local DNA shape. It is also possible that the sequences between the transcription factor binding sites may be important for nucleosome positioning which may be important for the DAE activity. In support of this, we found that quite interestingly, this enhancer has a pair of well positioned nucleosomes in the critical segment of the enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref>). It is conceivable that the sequences between the transcription factor binding sites may be important for determining the nucleosome positioning, which may be important for the activity of this enhancer. In future studies it will be very interesting to find out how this nucleosome positioning is encoded in the enhancer sequence, and how it will affect the enhancer activity, and whether the sequences between the transcription factors also affects the enhancer activity through other mechanisms.</p>

<p>In summay, starting with an enhancer which was thought to have a simple transactivating input in the form of binding sites for Zid and Bcd, we found that the sequences between Zid and Bcd sites harbor important information required for <italic>hb</italic> DAE activity. While we cannot exclude the possibility that an uncharacterized transcription factor may contribute, we have enough evidence to suggest that the sequences do not function through transcription factor binding, and instead may affect <italic>hb</italic> DAE activity by other mechanisms. Characterizing the function of these non-factor binding sequences will be a challenge in future studies but will be important towards our full understanding of enhancer structure and function.</p>

<title>Creation of Mutant Enhancers</title>
<p>To generate random sequences used to replace the sequences between transcription factor binding sites, each random base pair was pick from the four nucleotides ACGT after shuffling them using the perl fisher yates&#x005F;shuffle module. The random sequences were first scanned with patser program to make sure no new Bcd, Zid, and Gt sites were generated by chance. The mutant enhancers containing random sequence replacement between core or full transcription factor binding sites throughout the enhancer sequence, <italic>hb</italic> DAE(Rd) and <italic>hb</italic> DAE(Rd-f), and the mutant enhancer sequence in which the sequences between transcription factor binding sites were altered by swapping the top and bottom bases for each base pair were synthesized as gBlocks gene fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies). The synthesized DNA fragments also included the 50 bp sequences flanking the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 1 enhancer, which are necessary for swapping the mutant enhancer sequences in place of the galK sequence in <italic>eve</italic> bac vector by recombineering (see below).</p>
<p>To generate enhancer mutants in which only sequences in a certain region (200bp or 50 bp) of the enhancer were replaced with random sequences, an overlap extension PCR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Horton et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yon and Fried, 1989</xref>) was used. The scheme to generate the sequence is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig.S7</xref>, along with the primers used. Briefly, to create the constructs containing random sequences in 200 bp regions (hb-DAE(Rd-200A-C)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig. S7B,E</xref>), the regions containing the random sequences were amplified from the hb-DAE(Rd) mutant enhancer construct, while the wild type segments were amplified from the wild type <italic>hb</italic> DAE reporter construct. The primers used to amplify the mutant and the wild type segments contained overlapping sequences, allowing the overlap extension PCR to sew pairs of (or three) mutant and wild type sequences together to obtain the final mutant enhancer.</p>
<p>To create constructs in which only a 50 bp region was altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Fig.S7D,E</xref>), the upstream and downstream segments of the enhancer flanking the 50 region were amplified by PCR using the wild type <italic>hb</italic> DAE reporter construct as template, and using the upstream and downstream primers, each of which was paired with a primer flanking the 50 bp region. The two primers flanking the 50bp regions also contained additional sequences that correspond to overlapping portions of the 50 bp mutant sequence, which allow the creation of the 50 bp mutant region after the two segments were joined by overlap extension/sewing PCR with the primers that flank the whole enhancer to create the partially altered enhancer.</p>
<p>The Bcd binding site mutants were also created by overlap extension PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig.S8</xref>. In this case, however, the primers overlapping the Bcd sites to be mutated were used. The mutations were introduced to the primers, which were used together with primers matching 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; ends of enhancer sequence to amplify segments of the enhancer sequence. The resulting fragments were then stitched together by PCR using the primers flanking the enhancer, producing the full-length mutated enhancer.</p>

The starting <italic>eve</italic> bac plasmid P[acman]-CH322-103k22-GFP, We removed the CDS of the <italic>eve</italic> gene in this construct to generate peve-GFP by standard recombineering procedure, by first replacing the <italic>eve</italic> CDS with galK sequence amplified from a galK plasmid pBALU1 using primers flanked by <italic>eve</italic> sequences:</p>

<p>We further replaced the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 2 and then <italic>eve</italic> stripe 1 enhancers in this plasmid with bacteria amp<sup>r</sup> gene and the bacteria galK gene respectively to generate the <italic>eve</italic> bac reporter vector, peve-GFP/S2xAmp<sup>r</sup>-S1xgalK.

<p>All other enhancer reporter constructs were created by swapping out the galK sequence in bac vector generated above through recombineering and replaced with the wild type and mutant <italic>hb</italic> DAE enhancer DNA either custom made (Integrated DNA technologies) or by PCR as described above. These DNA sequences all were flanked by sequences around the <italic>eve</italic> stripe 1 sequence that was replaced by the galK sequence as underlined in the two oligos listed above.</p>
<p>The transgenes were generated by injecting the reporter construct plasmids into the embryos from flies that carry the VK33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Venken et al., 2006</xref>) attp landing site on chromosome 3 using the services of Rainbow Transgenic flies Inc and Bestgene Inc. The transgenes were identified by crossing the G0 flies from injected embryos to a yw; TM3 sb balancer line and screening for red eye phenotype. Homozygous lines for the transgenes were established by selfing the balanced red eye flies.</p>

<p>FISH was carried out with embryos collected from the transgene flies and fixed with formaldehyde as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kosman et al., 2004</xref>) with some modifications.</p>
<p>To prepare the RNA probe for the reporter gene, the eGFP reporter gene and the kan<sup>R</sup> gene sequences were amplified by PCR separately from the <italic>eve</italic> reporter construct using the following oligos:</p>

<p>The reverse primers used contained T7 promoter sequence at their 5&#x2019; end, allowing the PCR products to be used directly for RNA probe synthesis. The probes were made using Thermo Transcript Aid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. K0441) with the Digoxigenin(DIG) RNA labeling mix from Roche (cat. no. 1277073) and were not hydrolyzed before being used.</p>
<p>The embryos were collected for 2 hours and aged for 1 hr and 20 min and were fixed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kosman et al. 2004</xref>). The preparation before hybridization, and the hybridization step were carried out as previously described, except that the protease K treatment and the second post-fix step that followed were skipped. For florescent detection, the embryos were incubated with pre-absorbed sheep anti-DIG-POD (Roche, cat. no. 11207733910). Following incubation and washing, the embryos were mixed and incubated with TSA coumarin in amplification buffer and incubated by rocking. The embryos were washed, and near the end of wash were incubated with Sytox Green nucleic acid stain (ThermoFisher Scienctific, cat. no. S7020) to label the nuclei. The embryos were washed again once, and mounted in 70&#x0025; glycerol, 2.5&#x0025; DABCO.</p>
<p>The embryo imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM800 microscope with a 10x objective. For all experiments, Z stack images were taken from top to the mid-section of each embryo with the image size set at 2014&#x00D7;849, or a resolution of about 0.27 &#x03BC;m/pixel. The other settings differed between experiments, which was not anticipated to affect the results since reporter activities detected for the mutant enhancers were always compared to the signals detected for wild type enhancer in the same experiment. For earlier experiments, 15 z stacks were taken for each embryo with thickness of about 5.6 &#x03BC;m, and the fluorescence signals for coumarin with an excitation wavelength of 405 and Sytox Green with excitation wavelength at 488 were obtained sequentially with the &#x201C;smart&#x201D; setting. For later experiments, 30 z stacks of images per embryo were taken, and the two flurorence signals were obtained simultaneously with the &#x201C;fast&#x201D; setting. In all cases, the laser power and digital gain for each dye were adjusted in each experiment to make sure the maximum signal obtained was below saturation.</p>
<p>The images were analyzed with the Zeiss image analysis software zen 2. A 2-D image was generated for each embryo from the z stack images using the orthogonal maximum projection function. Then the fluorescent signal profiles for the RNA (coumarin) and nuclei (sytox green) were generated for a rectangle area drawn to the length of the embryo along the A/P axis, and with a width of 200 pixels, about a third of the embryo width. The signals along the A/P axis were then divided into 100 bins corresponding to the percent egg length. The coumarin signals were then divided by the corresponding Sytox signals as a simple way of normalization to correct for the nuclear density variation between different part of the embryo and between embryos. Furthermore, since the reporter signal between egg length 50&#x0025; - 60&#x0025; is the lowest in the coumarin signal profile, and not affected by the presence <italic>hb</italic> DAE, and the average of signal in this region was taken as background and subtracted from the signal throughout the whole embryo.</p>
