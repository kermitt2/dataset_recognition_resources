<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>The mouse olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) repertoire is composed of 10 million cells and each expresses one olfactory receptor (OR) gene from a pool of over 1000. Thus, the nose is sub-stratified into more than a thousand OSN subtypes. Here, we employ and validate an RNA-sequencing based method to quantify the abundance of all OSN subtypes in parallel, and investigate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to neuronal diversity. We find that the OSN subtype distribution is stereotyped in genetically identical mice, but varies extensively between different strains. Further, we identify <italic>cis</italic>-acting genetic variation as the greatest component influencing OSN composition and demonstrate independence from OR function. However, we show that olfactory stimulation with particular odorants results in modulation of dozens of OSN subtypes in a subtle but reproducible, specific and time-dependent manner. Together, these mechanisms generate a highly individualized olfactory sensory system by promoting neuronal diversity.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Mapping the neuronal diversity within a brain remains a fundamental challenge of neuroscience. Quantifying variance in a population of neurons within and between individuals first requires precise discrimination of cellular subtypes, followed by an accurate method of counting them. While this has been achieved in a simple invertebrate model containing hundreds of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">White et al., 1986</xref>), applying the same approach to mammalian brains that encompass many millions of neurons represents a significant challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wichterle et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The main olfactory epithelium (MOE) is an essential component of the olfactory sensory system. It contains olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express olfactory receptors (ORs), the proteins that bind odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>). The mouse genome codes for over a thousand functional OR genes, but each mature OSN expresses only one abundantly, in a monoallelic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hanchate et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saraiva et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chess et al., 1994</xref>). This results in a highly heterogeneous repertoire of approximately 10 million OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kawagishi et al., 2014</xref>) within the nose of a mouse, stratified into more than a thousand functionally distinct subpopulations, each one characterized by the particular OR it expresses. The monogenic nature of OR expression serves as a molecular barcode for OSN subtype identity. Thus, the MOE offers a unique opportunity to generate a comprehensive neuronal map of a complex mammalian sensory organ, and investigate the mechanisms that influence its composition and maintenance.</p>
<p>To date only a few studies have quantified the number of OSNs that express a given OR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bressel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fuss et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Royal and Key, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Young et al., 2003</xref>). For the scarce data available (&#x003C;10% of the full repertoire) reproducible differences in abundance have been observed between OSNs expressing different ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bressel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fuss et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Young et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests variance in the representation of OSN subtypes exists within an individual, but the extent of variation between individuals is unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms that dictate the abundance of OSN subtypes are poorly understood. Most promoters of OR genes contain binding sites for Olf/Ebf1 (O/E) and homeodomain (HD) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Young et al., 2011</xref>) and these are involved in determining the probability with which the OR genes are chosen for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rothman et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vassalli et al., 2011</xref>). Enhancer elements also regulate the gene choice frequencies of nearby, but not distally located, ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>). To date these studies have focused only on a handful of OSN subtypes.</p>
<p>In addition to OR gene choice regulation exerted by genetic elements, it is conceivable that the olfactory system adapts to the environment. The MOE is continually replacing its OSN pool and the birth of every neuron presents an opportunity to shape the proportion of different subpopulations. It is also possible that relative OSN abundances could be altered by regulating the lifespan of each OSN subtype. Indeed activation extends a sensory neuron&#x2019;s life-span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>), suggesting that persistent exposure to particular odorants may, over time, increase the relative proportions of the OSNs responsive to them. Some OSN subtypes do reportedly increase in number in response to odor activation, but others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cavallin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watt et al., 2004</xref>). Whether this variation reflects differences in the biology of OSN subtypes or experimental procedures is unclear.</p>
<p>Here we fully map OSN diversity in the MOE and characterize the influence of both genetic and environmental factors on its regulation. We show that RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is an accurate proxy for measuring the number of OSNs expressing a particular OR type, and use this approach to quantify, in parallel, the composition of 1,115 OSN subtypes in the MOE. We report that, while the repertoire of OSN subtypes is stable across individuals from the same strain, it reproducibly and extensively differs between genetically divergent strains of laboratory mice. We show that under controlled environmental conditions these stereotypic differences in OSN abundance are directed by genetic variation within regulatory elements of OR genes that act in <italic>cis</italic>, and are independent of the sequence or function of the OR protein. However, we find that persistent, but not continuous, exposure to specific odorants can also subtly alter abundance of the OSN subtypes that are responsive to such stimuli. Taken together, these results show that the OSN repertoire is shaped by both genetic and environmental influences to generate a unique nose for each individual.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Olfactory Sensory Neuron Diversity Measured by RNAseq</title>
<p>Previously, we characterized the transcriptional profile of the whole olfactory mucosa (WOM) in adult C57BL/6J animals (hereafter termed B6) to generate hundreds of new, extended OR gene annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014</xref>). As each OR gene is expressed in only a small fraction of cells within WOM, differences in their abundance are difficult to distinguish from sampling bias. We hypothesized that mapping RNAseq data to significantly extended OR transcripts should increase detection sensitivity. With these models, OR gene mRNA level estimates in adult WOM increase, on average, 2.3-fold, but some increase almost 20-fold (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). Despite this improvement, most OR mRNAs still have relatively low expression values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, they show a dynamic range of abundance levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>inset</bold>) that are consistent between biological replicates, as indicated by their very high correlation values (median rho &#x003D; 0.89, p &#x003C; 2.2 x 10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>).</p>

<p>To assess whether these low OR mRNA expression values are biologically meaningful or if they represent low-level technical artifacts of RNAseq analysis, we sequenced RNA from WOM of a mouse strain, <italic>&#x0394;Olfr7&#x0394;</italic>, that has a targeted homozygous deletion of the <italic>Olfr7</italic> OR gene cluster on chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xie et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>), and compared their gene expression to control mice. From the 94 OR genes of the cluster that have been deleted, 83 (88.3%) have no counts in any of the three biological replicates. The 11 remaining genes have just one or two fragments mapped in only one of the replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), resulting in normalized counts of less than 0.4. In contrast, the control mice have from 14.2 to 498.1 normalized counts for the same genes. Together these experiments demonstrate that the use of extended gene models significantly increases the sensitivity to detect OR mRNA expression in WOM, and that the full dynamic range of abundances reflects true measures of OR gene expression.</p>
<p>The wide range of stereotypic OR gene expression can be explained by two scenarios, acting alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): either 1) OR genes with high expression values are monogenically expressed in more OSNs than those with low expression values; and/or 2) OR genes are consistently expressed at different levels per OSN. To differentiate between these possibilities, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) of probes specific to 6 OR genes with expression values distributed across the dynamic range. We then counted the number of OSNs in which each OR is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We find a perfect correlation between OSN number and RNAseq expression value (rho &#x003D; 1, p &#x003D; 0.0028). We additionally compared OR gene RNAseq expression levels with three independent measures of the number of OSNs expressing the same ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bressel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fuss et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>). In all three cases we find high correlations (<bold>Figure S1B-C</bold>). We next collected 63 single mature OSNs from WOM, and determined the OR gene most abundantly expressed in each using a single-cell RNAseq approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saraiva et al., 2015b</xref>). If OR expression levels in WOM reflect the proportion of OSNs that express each receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the probability of isolating each OSN type is not equal. Indeed, we find a strong selection bias towards OSNs that express OR genes with high RNAseq levels in WOM (hypergeometric test, p &#x003D; 6.44 x 10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting those OSN types are more numerous in the olfactory epithelium. Thus, consistent with a recent analysis in zebra fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Saraiva et al., 2015a</xref>), OR mRNA levels are an accurate measure of the number of each OSN subtype in the mouse WOM (scenario 1). But do consistent differences in OR mRNA levels per cell also contribute (scenario 2)? To test this we quantified the mRNA levels of the most abundant OR gene in each of the 63 single, mature OSNs, normalized to three stably expressed OSN marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Khan et al., 2013</xref>). We find OR mRNA levels vary within the single cells, but this does not correlate with expression levels across the WOM (rho &#x003D; &#x2212;0.04, p &#x003D; 0.7518) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Analysis of ERCC spike-ins confirmed that the levels of OR mRNAs in single OSNs are reliable. Moreover, the single OSN transcript levels also positively correlate with transcript levels in pools of millions of OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Saraiva et al., 2015b</xref>), demonstrating they reliably reflect the transcriptome within single cells. Together these data demonstrate that OR mRNA levels obtained by RNAseq are an accurate proxy for quantifying the diversity of OSN subtypes that express each receptor.</p>

<sec id="s2b"><title>The OSN Repertoire Differs Between Strains of Mouse</title>
<p>The relative proportion of each OSN subtype is stable between genetically identical animals. We have previously reported the expression of OR genes in B6 male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2014</xref>). By applying full gene models to these data, here we confirm their OSN distribution profiles are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); only 1.2% of the OR gene repertoire is significantly differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To investigate whether this OSN distribution is a stereotypic feature of the species, we next reconstructed the WOM transcriptome of a different laboratory strain, 129S5SvEv (hereafter termed 129). The 129 genome has 4.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 0.81 million small indels compared to B6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Keane et al., 2011</xref>), of which we find 13,484 SNPs and 1,936 indels within our extended OR gene transcripts. As OR genes are particularly variable in coding sequence between strains of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Logan, 2014</xref>), mapping RNAseq data from other strains to a B6 reference genome results in biases in OR gene expression estimates (<bold>Figure S2A</bold>). We therefore generated a pseudo-129 genome on which to map the RNAseq data, by editing the reference genome at all polymorphic sites. From the 1,249 OR genes, we find 462 are significantly differentially expressed (DE) compared to B6 (FDR &#x003C; 5%), representing 37% of the whole repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether greater genetic diversity influences the variance in OSN repertoire, we repeated this experiment using a wild-derived strain from the <italic>Mus musculus castaneus</italic> subspecies (CAST/EiJ, henceforth CAST). This strain has more than 17.6 million SNPs and 2.7 million indels relative to B6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Keane et al., 2011</xref>); of these, we calculated that 45,688 SNPs and 6,303 indels are found within our extended OR transcripts. After mapping to a pseudo-CAST genome (<bold>Figure S2B</bold>), 634 OR genes are significantly differentially expressed (FDR &#x003C; 5%) compared to B6, constituting 50.8% of the whole OR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). The changes in expression for some OR genes are dramatic: 132 genes have differences of at least 8-fold. Taking all pairwise comparisons into account (including 129 vs CAST, <bold>Figure S2C,D</bold>), 821 OR genes (65.7%) are DE between at least two strains. 136 of these are DE in all three pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>); for example there are consistently different numbers of <italic>Olfr6</italic>-expressing OSNs in each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if the DE OR genes between strains reflect differences in the number of OSN subtypes, we performed ISH with probes specific to OR genes with significantly different expression values between B6 and 129 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We then counted the number of OSNs that 6 different OR mRNAs are expressed in, in each strain, and compared this with their RNAseq expression values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). We find a high correlation between the difference in OSN number and the difference in RNAseq expression values between B6 and 129 (r<sup>2</sup> &#x003D; 0.97, p &#x003D; 0.0003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), demonstrating our RNAseq-based approach accurately measures the difference in OSN repertoires between strains.</p>
<p>OR gene clusters are enriched in copy number variants (CNVs) between individual human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nozawa et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Young et al., 2008</xref>) and mouse strain genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Graubert et al., 2007</xref>). Thus it is possible that variance in OSN subtype representations are a consequence of different numbers of highly similar OR genes between strains. To assess this, we mined CAST genome sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Keane et al., 2011</xref>) for heterozygous SNPs within annotated OR genes. We identified 51 ORs that contain ten or more heterozygous SNPs, an indication of additional alleles. Using genome sequencing data from these genes we identified 30 novel or misassembled OR genes. We remapped the CAST RNAseq data to a pseudo-CAST genome incorporating these new OR alleles and re-estimated the expression of the OR repertoire. The overall abundance profile remains unchanged except for 36 genes (<bold>Figure S2E</bold>). To assess whether this accounts for the observed differential expression between strains, we compared these estimates to B6. Only 12 of 634 OR genes lose their DE status, and 4 OR genes now become DE (<bold>Figure S2F</bold>). Thus, while differences in OR gene copy number minimally contribute to the diversity in OSN repertoire between three strains of mice, other mechanisms are responsible for most of the variation.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Genetic Background Instructs OSN Diversity Independent of Odor Environment</title>
<p>Genetically divergent mouse strains produce different chemical odortypes in their urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kwak et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yamaguchi et al., 1981</xref>) and amniotic fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Logan et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore each strain of mouse, when housed in homogeneous groups, is exposed to a unique pre- and post-natal olfactory environment. As odor exposure alters the life-span of OSNs in an activity dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Francois et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watt et al., 2004</xref>), genetic variation could regulate OSN population dynamics either directly or indirectly, via odortype. We therefore devised an experiment to test and differentiate the influence of the olfactory environment from the genetic background.</p>
<p>We transferred 4- to 8-cell stage B6 and 129 zygotes to F1 mothers to ensure they experienced an identical <italic>in utero</italic> environment. At birth, B6 litters were cross-fostered to B6 mothers and 129 litters to 129 mothers. In addition, B6 litters received a single 129 pup, and 129 litters a single B6 pup. Therefore, each litter experienced a characteristic olfactory environment, but one animal (the <italic>alien</italic>) had a different genetic background from the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At 10 weeks of age we quantified the OSN repertoires of six alien animals and six cage-mates using RNAseq. We found that the OSN repertoires cluster in two groups, clearly defined by genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The correlation coefficient for any two B6 samples was on average 0.97, with no significant difference between the environments (t-test, p &#x003D; 0.09). In contrast, the correlation for any B6 with a 129 sample had a mean of 0.89, which is significantly lower (t-test, p &#x003D; 3.8 x 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>). 507 OR genes, among 5,475 other genes are DE between these mice when grouped by strain (<bold>Figure S3A</bold>). In striking contrast, across the whole transcriptome we find only mRNA from two genes that show differences in expression according to odor environment, both of which encode ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <bold>S3B</bold>). These data demonstrate that the diversity in OSN repertoire we observe between strains is almost entirely dictated by direct genetic effects. In a controlled environment the influence of odortype on the development and maintenance of the MOE is minimal, perhaps restricted to only a few OSN subtypes.</p>

<sec id="s2d"><title>OSN Diversity Profiles are Independent of OR Function and are Controlled in <italic>cis</italic></title>
<p>The indifference of the OSN repertoire to the olfactory environment suggests its development and maintenance is not influenced by the specific activity of OR proteins or, by inference, their protein coding sequence. To further test this, we analyzed the OSN repertoire of newborn pups. We identify the presence of 1,198 (95.9%) OSN subtypes across a dynamic range of abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The differential proportions of OSNs expressing particular OR genes are therefore already present during the development of the MOE, suggesting that it is not dependent on the activity of the OSNs nor on differences in OSN life-span.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="074872_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Next we analyzed the expression of ORs that are pseudogenized and do not produce receptor proteins capable of odor-mediated activity, but can be co-expressed with functional ORs. These are represented in OSNs with a very similar distribution to functional OR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover we analyzed the OR genes that encode identical protein coding sequences between different strains. 36.3% of the OSN subtypes that express identical ORs are differentially represented between 129 and B6. 44.8% are differentially represented between CAST and B6. Together these results suggest that the proportion of each OSN subtype is not dependent on receptor activity.</p>
<p>To directly test whether the abundance of a particular OSN subtype is influenced by the identity of the receptor protein it expresses, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to replace only the coding sequence of <italic>Olfr1507</italic> with that of <italic>Olfr2</italic> (referred to as <italic>Olfr2&#x003E;Olfr1507</italic>), in a pure B6 genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). OSNs expressing <italic>Olfr1507</italic> are the most common subtype in B6 while <italic>Olfr2</italic> expressing OSNs are ranked 334<sup>th</sup> by decreasing abundance. Homozygous <italic>Olfr2&#x003E;Olfr1507</italic> animals have 47 fold more <italic>Olfr2</italic>-expressing OSNs compared to controls, and is the highest subtype in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). DE analysis of OR genes supports the striking reciprocal differences in <italic>Olfr1507</italic> and <italic>Olfr2</italic>-expressing OSNs in the <italic>Olfr2&#x003E;Olfr1507</italic> animals, but we also find 122 other OSN subtypes with significant, albeit subtle, differences (over 90% have fold-changes &#x003C;2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that the extensive variance in OSN subtype composition we observe within and between mice is determined by the wider genetic architecture of the animal, and is independent of the coding sequence and function of the OR proteins.</p>
<p>To investigate how genetic background influences OSN subtype abundances, we mined 129 and CAST whole genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Keane et al., 2011</xref>) for SNPs and short indels in regulatory regions of OR genes. We find that differentially represented OSN subtypes express OR genes with significantly greater amounts of variation in their coding sequence, whole transcript and regions of 300bp or 1kb upstream of the transcription start site, for both the 129 and CAST genomes (Mann-Whitney one tail, p &#x003C; 0.02 for 129 and p &#x003C; 0.0002 for CAST; <bold>Figure S4</bold>). Further, we scanned OR gene promoters for O/E and HD binding sites. In the CAST genome, 58 and 310 putative OR promoters have gains or losses of O/E and HD binding sites respectively, compared to the B6 genome. In contrast, only 12 and 46 OR promoters show differences in the number of O/E and HD binding sites respectively when comparing the 129 and B6 genomes.</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesized that OSN subtype repertoires are generated via sequence variance in OR gene promoter and/or local enhancer elements, which dictate the frequency of OR gene choice. For two OR gene clusters it has been demonstrated that enhancer/promoter interactions act in <italic>cis</italic> and do not influence the expression of the homologous OR allele on the other chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fuss et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nishizumi et al., 2007</xref>). However, recent chromosome conformation capture experiments revealed interchromosomal interactions between OR enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the differential representation of 122 other OSN subtypes in the <italic>Olfr2&#x003E;Olfr1507</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), 112 of which express ORs that are located on a different chromosome from <italic>Olfr1507</italic>, is consistent with the possibility that genetic modification of one OR locus directly influences the probability of choice in other ORs, in <italic>trans</italic>.</p>
<p>To determine whether the genetic elements that instruct the whole OSN repertoire are <italic>cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>-acting, we carried out an analysis at the OR allele level in B6&#x00D7;CAST F1 hybrids. Following the logic of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goncalves et al., 2012</xref>), if the genetic elements act in <italic>cis</italic> then we would expect the OSN subtypes that differ between B6 and CAST to be maintained between OSNs expressing the corresponding B6 and CAST alleles within an F1 hybrid. On the other hand, if the elements act in <italic>trans</italic> the number of OSNs that express the B6 derived allele in the F1 would not differ from those that express the CAST allele.</p>
<p>Within F1 mice 840 OSN subtypes (67.2%) expressed OR mRNAs that could be distinguished at the allelic level. Among these, the ratios between B6 and CAST OSN subtype abundance (F0) correlate with the ratios between alleles in the F1 hybrids at approximately 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In other words, the OSN subtypes expressing a B6 OR allele in F1 animals have the same repertoire as the B6 parent, while the subtypes expressing the CAST OR allele match the CAST parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, we demonstrate that the genetic elements dictating the abundance of over 800 OSN subtypes act in <italic>cis</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data are consistent with a model where genetic variation in local, non-coding regulatory elements determines the probability with which each OR gene is chosen early in OSN neurogenesis.</p>

<sec id="s2e"><title>Acute but not Chronic Odor Exposure Affects OR mRNA Expression in the WOM</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that OSNs activated by their cognate ligands have increased life-span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Francois et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watt et al., 2004</xref>). With time, longer survival rates should translate into enrichment in the neuronal population, compared to those OSN types that are mostly inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>). However, we found no evidence of different strain-or sex-derived odors influencing the OSN repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, 3B). Because these odor exposures were temporally constant, we hypothesized that the absence of an observed environmental influence on OSN repertoire could be due to olfactory adaptation (a reduction of specific olfactory sensitivity due to prolonged odor exposure, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zufall and Leinders-Zufall, 2000</xref>)).</p>
<p>To test this, we exposed mice to a mix of four chemically distinct odorants (acetophenone, eugenol, heptanal and (R)-carvone). The odorant mixture was added to the drinking water supplied to the animals to avoid adaptation, such that they could smell the odor mixture when they approached the bottle to drink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We collected the WOM from animals exposed to the odorants for 24 weeks from birth, along with water-exposed controls, and performed RNAseq. DE analysis reveals 36 OR genes with significantly different mRNA levels (FDR &#x003C; 5%), with similar numbers more or less abundant in the exposed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <bold>S5</bold>). We selected seven OR genes with the biggest fold-changes in mRNA level for which specific TaqMan qPCR probes were available, and validated their expression levels in an independent cohort. The results indicate that all the tested genes have mRNA levels that are statistically significantly different from controls (t-test, FDR &#x003C; 5%) and the direction of the expression changes are concordant with the RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To characterize the temporal dynamics of these OR mRNAs, we tested their expression after different periods of exposure (1, 4 and 10 weeks) in independent samples. After one week of treatment none showed significant differences from controls, which is expected since young pups do not drink from the odorized water bottle. After 4 weeks, three of the OR genes are DE from controls, and at 10 weeks five out of the seven receptors are DE (t-test, FDR &#x003C; 5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To assess the plasticity of these changes, we stimulated a group of animals for four weeks, and then removed the stimuli for an additional six weeks. In these mice none of the OR genes are DE from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, the overall abundance of specific OR types in WOM is increasingly altered, over a period of weeks to months, upon frequent environmental exposure to defined olfactory cues. These differences are reversible, however, and require persistent stimulation to be maintained.</p>
<p>To investigate whether olfactory adaptation blocks this effect, we presented the same odor mixture on a cotton ball inside a tea strainer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), such that the stimuli are present in a sustained manner. None of the same seven OR genes are DE after 24 weeks, nor are any consistently dysregulated during the course of the exposure experiment (t-test, FDR &#x003C; 5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, when odorants are present in the environment in a constant manner (similar to those differentially produced by gender or strains of mice), the OR mRNA abundance levels most responsive to acute exposure remain unchanged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f"><title>Differential regulation of OR gene mRNAs is odorant-specific</title>
<p>If temporal differences in OR mRNA abundance are a consequence of odorant-specific activity, exposure to different odorants should lead to the differential expression of discrete subsets of OR genes. To test this we odorized the drinking water with (R)-carvone alone, heptanal alone, or with the combination of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After 10 weeks of exposure we tested the expression of the seven DE OR mRNAs that were responsive to the four odor mix (acetophenone, eugenol, heptanal and (R)-carvone), by TaqMan qRT-PCR. None of the genes are significantly DE in the animals exposed to (R)-carvone alone. However, four of the seven OR genes have mRNA levels significantly different in the animals exposed to heptanal, or to the combination of both odorants (t-test, FDR &#x003C; 5%; <bold>Figure S6A</bold>). We next carried out a transcriptome-wide analysis by RNAseq, finding 43 OR genes significantly DE in at least one of the conditions (FDR &#x003C; 5%) of which 32 (74.4%) are upregulated in the odor-stimulated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Exposure to (R)-carvone or heptanal resulted in a change in mRNA expression of 15 and 20 OR genes, respectively. These sets of receptors are almost completely independent, with only one OR mRNA significantly upregulated in both groups (<italic>Olfr538</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>). The animals that were exposed to both odorants simultaneously showed significant changes in mRNA levels for 24 OR genes, 15 of which are shared with the individually exposed groups (hypergeometric test, p &#x003D; 1.87 x 10<sup>&#x2212;19</sup>). Almost 40% of the ORs that show significant changes when exposed to all four odorants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) are also significantly altered in one or more of the groups exposed to (R)-carvone, heptanal or their combination. Thus, together these data demonstrate that acute environmental exposure to the odorants alters the global expression of around 1.2-1.6% of OR genes in the WOM. These changes are odor-specific and reproducible in isolation and in increasingly complex mixtures.</p>

<p>To investigate whether DE OR genes are directly activated by the environmental odorants, we expressed a subset (<italic>Olfr538</italic>, <italic>Olfr902</italic>, <italic>Olfr916</italic>, <italic>Olfr1182</italic>, <italic>Olfr347</italic> and <italic>Olfr524</italic>) in a heterologous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhuang and Matsunami, 2008</xref>) and challenged them with increasing concentrations of (R)-carvone and heptanal. Half of the DE ORs we tested were responsive <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-F</xref>, <bold>S6B</bold>): for example <italic>Olfr538</italic> displayed a dose-dependent response to (R)-carvone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and <italic>Olfr524</italic> was responsive to heptanal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>Some odorants, including heptanal, are known to be decomposed by enzymes present in the nasal mucus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nagashima and Touhara, 2010</xref>) such that <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to an odorant may result in stimulation of the OSNs with chemically distinct byproducts. We therefore employed a recently published deorphanization system to identify the ORs that respond to heptanal stimulation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). This strategy exploits the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal subunit when an OSN is activated. Thus by coupling pS6-immunoprecipitation (ps6-IP) and RNAseq, the OR mRNAs expressed in the activated OSNs can be identified. We exposed mice to two concentrations of heptanal for an hour, and sequenced the mRNAs from OSNs after pS6-IP. Seven and 191 OR mRNAs were significantly enriched (FDR &#x003C; 5%) upon exposure to 1% and 100% heptanal, respectively, compared to controls. Half of DE ORs after 10-week acute exposure to heptanal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) are also DE in the pS6<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), which is significantly more than expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p &#x003D; 0.0003). Thus, using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> methods, we conclude that long-term odor-mediated changes in OR gene expression occurs via direct activation of OSNs expressing those receptors.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>We have exploited the power of RNA sequencing and the monogenic and monoallelic nature of OR gene expression, to comprehensively characterize the full neuronal diversity of a mammalian nose. We have discovered that the representation of OSN subtypes within an individual is highly unequal but stereotyped between animals of the same genetic background. We show that non-coding genetic variation results in high divergence of the relative proportions of different OSN subtypes, with most being susceptible to altered abundance. OSN diversity is controlled by genetic elements that act in <italic>cis</italic>, and is not affected by receptor sequence or function in a sustained olfactory environment. However, the persistent but interleaved presentation of olfactory stimuli can alter the representation of specific ORs in an activity dependent manner, thus subtly shaping the genetically-encoded neuronal repertoire to the olfactory environment.</p>
<sec id="s3a"><title>The MOE is a genetically-determined mosaic of OSN subtypes</title>
<p>The process of OR gene choice, stabilization and exclusion during OSN maturation is poorly understood. Occasionally, it is referred to as a <italic>random</italic> process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">McClintock, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rodriguez, 2013</xref>), suggesting there is no pattern or predictability to the outcome. However our data indicates that, at the OSN population level, the result of this process is deterministic. A particular genetic background in controlled environmental conditions reproducibly generates an OSN population with fixed, unequal proportions of the different OSN subtypes. Thus the process that generates this profile is more accurately described as <italic>stochastic.</italic> Despite divergence in the profiles generated by different genomes, all show a similarly shaped distribution: a small proportion of OSN subtypes are present at high levels with a rapid decay in abundance thereafter. In fact, 3.6% or less of the OSN subtypes contribute to 25% of the overall neuronal content of the WOM. We find that unequal OSN distributions are already present at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting the genetic influence is on the process of OR gene choice/stabilization rather than modulating neuronal survival.</p>
<p>Proximity to the H element, a cluster-specific enhancer, increases the frequency in which an OR is represented within the OSN population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Khan et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore the most highly represented OSN types may express OR genes located close to other strong enhancers. However, we propose that genetic variation in enhancers is not sufficient to account for the full diversity of differences in OSN subtypes between strains, as different ORs located adjacent to one another within a cluster are frequently represented very differently. Recently it has been proposed that higher levels of OR transcription per cell may result in more OSNs expressing that receptor due to increased success in a post-selection refinement process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016</xref>). Our measurements of OR mRNA expression levels in 63 single OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) do not support this hypothesis. Instead our data are consistent with a model where non-uniform probabilities of OR choice are instructed by genetic variation in both specific OR promoters and enhancers. Supporting this model, we identified many putative promoters for differentially represented ORs where genetic variation has altered the number of Olf1/Ebf1 (O/E) and homeodomain (HD) transcription factors binding sites between the mouse strains, both sequences known to influence OR choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">D&#x2019;Hulst et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vassalli et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, through analysis of F1 hybrids we confirmed the finding that the choice of OR genes linked to the H element are regulated in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fuss et al., 2007</xref>), and extended this to find no evidence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting enhancers regulating choice for over 800 additional OR genes distributed throughout the genome. Instead, the haploid CAST-and B6-derived OR alleles within an F1 are each regulated almost identically as they are in a diploid state within their original genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). Our data are inconsistent with <italic>trans</italic>-interactions of multiple enhancers acting additively to regulate OR choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). These <italic>trans</italic> interactions may, however, stabilize or maintain OR singularity after choice has been instructed in <italic>cis</italic>.</p>
<p>Many existing studies into OR gene choice, especially those utilizing transgenic mouse lines, use animals with a mixed 129/B6 genetic background. The remarkable diversity in the OSN repertoire between these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggests caution should be exercised in their interpretation. Here we created a mouse line that carries the coding sequence of <italic>Olfr2</italic> in the locus of <italic>Olfr1507</italic>, the most frequently selected OR gene, in a pure B6 genetic background. Olfr2-expressing OSNs, which rank 334<sup>th</sup> across the repertoire in the original B6 strain, are the most abundant OSN subtype in this modified line, demonstrating the critical importance of the genetic context in the regulation of OR gene choice. Curiously, we also observed that ~10% of other OSN types show relatively subtle but reproducible differences in abundance. The mechanism underlying these differences is unclear. It could potentially be a consequence of the olfactory system adapting to an OR gene being misexpressed in a non-endogenous zone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b"><title>Odor-mediated plasticity in the olfactory system</title>
<p>The main olfactory epithelium regenerates throughout the life of an animal. It has been suggested that activity-mediated mechanisms may shape the olfactory system by increasing OSN survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Francois et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watt et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhao and Reed, 2001</xref>), though other studies have found that the number of specific OSN subtypes decrease or are unaffected by odor-exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cavallin et al., 2010</xref>). Each of these studies focused on one or two OSN subtypes and the odor exposure procedures varied significantly in frequency, persistence and length. Here we took a comprehensive approach, measuring the response of over 1000 ORs to four odorants, after different types of exposure from 1 week to 6 months. We find that mice living in stable chemical environments maintain the olfactory transcriptomes of their genetically-dictated OSN repertoire. However, when frequently recurring odor stimulation is introduced, the abundances of responsive ORs are modified. We propose that this difference is a result of olfactory adaptation in the presence of continuous stimulation. However, other factors may also contribute, for example the continuous exposure odors were likely detected orthonasally while the intermittently exposure odors were retronasally detected.</p>
<p>The lengthy timeframe for odor-mediated differences to emerge is consistent with modulation of OSN lifespan. It is mechanistically unlikely that odor-activity could influence OR gene choice, but it could promote OR expression stabilization. Compared to the dramatic influence of genetic variation on OSN repertoire, odor-evoked changes are subtle, typically less than a 2-fold change after 6 months of exposure. The limited effect magnitude and long-time scales precluded a more detailed analysis to confirm a correlative alteration in OSN number.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we identified ORs that became more abundant after exposure to specific odorants and, within the same animals, others that became less abundant. Both types were marked by phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal subunit, a feature of activated OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the differential expression is mediated by OSN subtype-specific olfactory stimulation. This may explain why very different conclusions were drawn from previous exposure studies on a small number of ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cavallin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Francois et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watt et al., 2004</xref>). Short-term odor exposures (30 min to 24 hr) result in a temporary downregulation of activated OR mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">von der Weid et al., 2015</xref>), presumably as part of the olfactory adaptation process. It is possible that our analyses are capturing this dynamic short-term response in addition to changes resulting from long-term exposures. We could not identify any phylogenetic or chromosomal predictor of the ORs that responded with contrasting directional effects, and at this time the logic underpinning the difference in the direction of expression changes remains unexplained.</p>

<sec id="s3c"><title>An individually unique olfactory nose</title>
<p>Genetic variation has great impact on individual phenotypic traits. Humans differ in up to a third of their OR alleles by functional variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mainland et al., 2014</xref>), which contributes to an individually unique sense of smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Secundo et al., 2015</xref>). Segregating OR alleles have been functionally linked to perceptual differences of their odor ligands, by altering intensity, valence or detection threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Jaeger et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Keller et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mainland et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McRae et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Menashe et al., 2007</xref>). However, in most cases these OR coding genetic variants explain only a small proportion of the observed phenotypic variance (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Logan, 2014</xref>)), suggesting that other factors contribute to individual differences in perception. Recently it has been demonstrated that increasing the number of a particular OSN subtype in a mouse nose increases olfactory sensitivity to its ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">D&#x2019;Hulst et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore the very different OSN repertoires present between strains of mice are likely to result in significant phenotypic variation in olfactory thresholds, and thus contribute to the individualization of olfaction.</p>
<p>Though it remains to be determined whether human OSN repertoires are as variable as the mice reported here, an array-based study of OR expression in 26 humans found unequal expression of ORs within and between individual noses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Verbeurgt et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, a recent systematic survey of olfactory perception in humans found high levels of individual variability in reporting the intensity of some odors (for example, benzenethiol and 3-pentanone) but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Keller and Vosshall, 2016</xref>). Further, a non-coding variant within an OR cluster associated with insensitivity to 2-heptanone has been shown to be dominant to the sensitive allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">McRae et al., 2013</xref>). As OR genes are regulated monoallelicaly, this implies that a 50% reduction in the sensitive OR allele dosage is, in some cases, sufficient to influence perception. On the other hand, because many odorants activate multiple OSN subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>), a differential representation of one subtype may have a limited influence on the overall perception of its odor.</p>
<p>Further investigation into the functional consequence of diverse OSN repertoires will be necessary to determine the full extent to which they individualize the sense of smell.</p>
