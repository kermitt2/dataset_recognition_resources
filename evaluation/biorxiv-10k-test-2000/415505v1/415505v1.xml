<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> are highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP synthesis, redox balance and provision of essential anabolic precursors. Recent studies have suggested that members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family of metabolite phosphatases may play an important role in regulating multiple pathways in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> central carbon metabolism. Here, we show that the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> HAD protein, phosphoglycolate phosphatase (<italic>Pf</italic>PGP), which is homologous to yeast Pho13 and mammalian PGP, regulates glycolysis in asexual blood stages by controlling intracellular levels of several intermediates and novel end-products of this pathway. Deletion of the <italic>P. falciparum pgp</italic> gene significantly attenuated asexual parasite growth in red blood cells, while comprehensive metabolomic analysis revealed the accumulation of two previously uncharacterized metabolites, as well as changes in a number of intermediates in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The two unknown metabolites were assigned as 2-phospho-lactate and 4-phosphoerythronate by comparison of their mass spectra with synthetic standards. 2-Phospho-lactate was significantly elevated in wildtype and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites cultivated in the presence of methylglyoxal and D-lactate, but not L-lactate, indicating that it is a novel end-product of the methylglyoxal pathway. 4-Phosphoerythronate is a putative side product of the glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and the accumulation of both 4-phosphoerythronate and 2-phospho-D-lactate were associated with changes in glycolytic and the pentose phosphate pathway fluxes as shown by <sup>13</sup>C-glucose labelling studies and increased sensitivity of the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites to the drug fosmidomycin. Our results suggest that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP contributes to a novel futile metabolic cycle involving the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of D-lactate as well as detoxification of metabolites, such as 4-phosphoerythronate, and both may have important roles in regulating <italic>P. falciparum</italic> central carbon metabolism.</p><sec>
<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The major pathogenic stages of the malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, develop in red blood cells where they have access to an abundant supply of glucose. Unsurprisingly these parasite stages are addicted to using glucose, which is catabolized in the glycolytic and the pentose phosphate pathways. While these pathways also exist in host cells, there is increasing evidence that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has evolved novel ways for regulating glucose metabolism that could be targeted by next-generation of anti-malarial drugs. In this study, we show the red blood cell stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> express an enzyme that is specifically involved in regulating the intracellular levels of two metabolites that are novel end-products or side products of glycolysis. Parasite mutants lacking this enzyme are viable but exhibit diminished growth rates in red blood cells. These mutant lines accumulate the two metabolites, and exhibit global changes in central carbon metabolism. Our findings suggest that metabolic end/side products of glycolysis directly regulate the metabolism of these parasites, and that the intracellular levels of these are tightly controlled by previously uncharacterized metabolite phosphatases.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the major cause of malaria, a disease that continues to kill &#x223C; 445,000 people each year and has significant impacts on the development of some of the poorest countries (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The symptoms of malaria arise from the progressive &#x223C; 48-hour cycles of parasite invasion into host red blood cells (RBC), rapid growth of asexual parasite stages within RBC and subsequent RBC lysis. RBC provide intracellular parasite stages with abundant supplies of glucose, amino acids and other carbon sources derived from the serum and/or breakdown of RBC proteins and lipids. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages primarily use glucose as their major carbon source and are largely dependent on glycolysis for generation of ATP, although they retain a low flux TCA cycle for generation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Rates of glucose utilization and L-lactate production from glycolysis are increased up to 100-fold in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected RBC compared to uninfected RBC (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The high glycolytic flux of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual stages provides these cells with sufficient ATP and biosynthetic precursors to sustain anabolic processes and high rates of replication. However, high rates of glycolysis can generate toxic metabolic end-products, such as methylglyoxal, which can lead to increased oxidative stress, chemical modification and denaturation/inactivation of proteins, lipids and DNA (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Thus, it is likely that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has evolved ways to regulate pathways such as glycolysis under nutrient excess conditions.</p>
<p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites express only a limited number of transcription factors and possess limited nutrient-stimulated transcriptional control (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), indicating that regulation of central carbon metabolism primarily occurs at the post-transcriptional level. It is intriguing that biochemical investigations have uncovered a lack of conventional eukaryote allosteric regulatory/feedback mechanisms, suggesting dependence on other post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). One group of proteins that has a role in regulating glycolysis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual stages is the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family of metabolite phosphatases. The first member of this family to be functionally characterized was <italic>Pf</italic>HAD1, identified in a screen for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mutant lines that were resistant to the isoprenoid biosynthesis inhibitor fosmidomycin (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). HAD1 exhibited broad <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase activity against a range of sugar-phosphates and triose-phosphates that are connected to glycolysis, suggesting that it might have a role <italic>in vivo</italic> in the promiscuous dephosphorylation of glycolytic intermediates and negatively regulate glycolytic fluxes. Mutational inactivation of HAD1 leads to increased glycolytic flux and flow of intermediates into anabolic pathways such as isoprenoid biosynthesis, with associated increase in fosmidomycin resistance. Interestingly, a second HAD enzyme, HAD2 was identified in the same screen and was shown to exhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase activity against glycolytic intermediates, suggesting that HAD enzymes may regulate multiple pathways in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> central carbon metabolism (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the HAD family members in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome is homologous to the enzyme phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP), which is involved in regulating intracellular levels of several metabolites, including glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P), 2-phosphoglycolate, 2-phospho-L-lactate and 4-phosphoerythronate (4-PE) (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). 2-Phospho-L-lactate and 4-PE are thought to be minor side-products of the high flux reactions catalyzed by pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), respectively (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). PGP may thus act as a metabolite repair enzyme that detoxifies metabolites that would otherwise accumulate and allosterically affect key enzymes in central carbon metabolism (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study we have investigated the role of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PGP in asexual blood stages. In contrast to the situation in animal cells, we find that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> accumulates 2-phospho-D-lactate, rather than 2-phospho-L-lactate, indicating synthesis through the methylglyoxal pathway rather than via enzymes in lower glycolysis. We show that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP regulates the level of this novel end-product and contributes to a metabolic futile cycle that may regulate intracellular ATP levels. <italic>Pf</italic>PGP is also involved in detoxifying 4-PE and we provide evidence that the accumulation of 4-PE leads to dysregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis, as well as increased sensitivity to fosmidomycin. Overall, these data highlight novel aspects of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> glycolysis and a key role for <italic>Pf</italic>PGP in regulating central carbon metabolism in asexual blood stages.</p>

<title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> PGP is a cytoplasmic protein required for normal growth of asexual stages in RBC</title>
<p>The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gene, PF3D7_0715000 (hereinafter referred to as <italic>Pf</italic>PGP) shares homology to the phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) family of HAD enzymes that are involved in regulating the intracellular levels of key phospho-intermediates or end-products generated in glycolytically active cells, and features all four characteristic HAD motifs in its sequence (Fig. S1) (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP may be involved in vitamin B1 biosynthesis, although this role has yet to be confirmed (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Given the strong dependence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages on glycolysis for generation of ATP, redox balance and generation of anabolic precursors, we reinvestigated the functional role of <italic>Pf</italic>PGP. Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), we show that a <italic>Pf</italic>PGP-GFP fusion protein is exclusively located in the cytoplasm of asexual blood stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and is readily extracted in either phosphate buffer saline/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer/SDS (Fig. S2a).</p>

<p>To characterise the role of <italic>Pf</italic>PGP <italic>in vivo</italic>, a knock-out parasite line was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. S2b) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). PGP-deleted <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mutants (&#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP) were recovered and loss of the gene was confirmed by PCR (Fig. S2c). Analysis of the growth of two clones of the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP line indicated that loss of this gene was associated with a significant decrease in growth rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005 and 0.039 for clones 1 and 2, respectively). While the NF54 parental line had a doubling time of 1.04 &#x00B1; 0.12 days, &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP clones 1 and 2 had doubling times of 1.48 &#x00B1; 0.24 days and 1.21 &#x00B1; 0.03 days, respectively. As the culture medium contains vitamin B1 and other vitamins, these data support the premise that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP has a metabolic function distinct from vitamin B1 biosynthesis.</p>
<p>To define the function of <italic>Pf</italic>PGP, we undertook a comprehensive metabolomic analysis of parental (NF54) and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant parasite lines. Trophozoite-stage infected RBC were magnetically enriched (&#x003E; 95&#x0025; parasitemia), and metabolites were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The mutant parasite line showed selective increases in a number of metabolites associated with the pentose phosphate pathway (6-phosphogluconate, ribose/ribulose-5-phosphate), flavin mononucleotide and two unknown peaks with accurate masses (<italic>m/z</italic>; mass over charge ratio) of 168.9909 and 214.9968, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Candidate metabolites for 168.9909 <italic>m/z</italic> included the glycolytic intermediates, glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), or the two enantiomers of phospho-D/L-lactate (METLIN metabolite database). GAP or DHAP were discounted based on the lack of co-elution with authentic standards for these metabolites on LC-MS or gas chromatography &#x2013; mass spectrometry (GC-MS), indicating that the 168.9909 <italic>m/z</italic> peak may be phospho-D/L-lactate. To distinguish between the two possible enantiomers, parasite-infected RBC were incubated in the presence of either L- or D-lactate and intracellular levels of the 168.9909 <italic>m/z</italic> peak determined by targeted GC-MS analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Consistent with the untargeted analysis, accumulation of 168.9909 <italic>m/z</italic> was increased 12-fold (&#x00B1; 2.4) in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP line compared to the parental wildtype (WT) line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, left panel). Addition of 2 mM L-lactate (the major enantiomer generated by glycolysis) to WT or &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasite cultures had no effect on the intracellular levels of this metabolite. In contrast, incubation of either WT or &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites with D-lactate resulted in a marked increase of the 168.9909 <italic>m/z</italic> peak (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, right panel). The 168.9909 <italic>m/z</italic> peak was confirmed as phospholactate by synthesizing racemic 2-phospho-D/L-lactate. This standard had the same fragmentation profile and retention time as the peak of interest via GC-MS (Fig. S3). Taken together, these data indicate that WT parasites are capable of phosphorylating endogenous and exogenous D-lactate to form 2-phospho-D-lactate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), and that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP is involved in dephosphorylating this species back to D-lactate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Phospholactate is a product of the methylglyoxal pathway</title>
<p>In animal cells, 2-phospho-L-lactate is thought to be a by-product of the terminal glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The finding that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> phospholactate is derived from the D-stereoisomer of lactate indicates, for this case, that an additional pathway for synthesizing this intermediate must operate. The only pathway known to generate D-lactate in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the methylglyoxal pathway, which is required for detoxification of methylglyoxal formed by non-enzymatic phosphate elimination of the glycolytic triose phosphates, GAP and DHAP (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Methylglyoxal is converted to <italic>S</italic>-D-lactoyl-glutathione by glyoxalase I (GloI) and then further metabolized to D-lactate by glyoxalase II (GloII) (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To investigate whether the D-lactate generated in this pathway is converted to 2-phospho-D-lactate we generated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> knock-out lines lacking the cytoplasmic <italic>gloI</italic> gene (PF3D7_1113700) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig. S4a) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Knock-out of <italic>PfgloI</italic> was confirmed by PCR (Fig. S4b). Analysis of lysates of saponin-purified <italic>P. falciparum</italic> trophozoites indicated that the &#x0394;GloI line had greatly reduced GloI activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, as measured by conversion of methylglyoxal and glutathione to D-lactate by GC-MS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Table S1). Specifically, the &#x0394;GloI parasites exhibited an 80&#x0025; reduction in D-lactate production after 60 minutes (WT = 100 &#x0025;, GloI KO = 20.61 &#x0025; &#x00B1; 9.1). Loss of <italic>Pf</italic>GloI was associated with a statistically significant growth defect over 13 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>; GloI KO_1 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0025 and GloI KO_2 <italic>P</italic> = 0.038; doubling time WT = 1.04 &#x00B1; 0.12 days / GloI KO_1 = 1.40 &#x00B1; 0.40 days / GloI KO_2 = 1.26 &#x00B1; 0.27 days) indicating that detoxification of methylglyoxal is important for normal asexual growth and development in RBC.</p>

<p>To investigate whether 2-phospho-D-lactate is synthesized by the methylglyoxal pathway, parental WT and &#x0394;GloI parasite cultures were suspended in medium containing methylglyoxal (1 mM, 1 hour, 37&#x00B0;C), then levels of 2-phospho-D-lactate were measured by GC-MS. Addition of methylglyoxal led to a 15-fold increase in 2-phospho-D-lactate levels, indicating that this metabolite is the end-product of the methylglyoxal pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Strikingly, similar levels of 2-phospho-D-lactate were present in both WT and &#x0394;GloI parasites, before and after addition of methylglyoxal, indicating that synthesis of D-lactate is not strictly dependent on <italic>Pf</italic>GloI. It is possible that the apicoplast isoform of GloI (GloI-like protein, GILP) could substitute for cytoplasmic GloI and/or that methylglyoxal can be converted to <italic>S</italic>-D-lactoyl-glutathione non-enzymatically. Alternatively, methylglyoxal may be converted to D-lactate by the RBC methylglyoxal pathway and D-lactate subsequently imported by the parasite and converted to 2-phospho-D-lactate. Collectively, these studies suggest that 2-phospho-D-lactate is generated by the direct phosphorylation of D-lactate produced by either the host cell, or the parasite methylglyoxal detoxification pathways.</p>

<title>Accumulation of 2-phospho-D-lactate is toxic at non-physiological concentrations</title>
<p>Next, we determined whether the reduced growth rate of the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant lines in RBC could be attributed to the toxic accumulation of 2-phospho-D-lactate. WT- and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP-infected RBC were suspended in medium containing 0, 1 and 5 mM D-lactate to elevate intracellular levels of 2-phospho-D-lactate and asexual parasite growth was monitored over a period of 13 days. Growth of both WT and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP, were significantly reduced in the presence of a high (5 mM) concentration of D-lactate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), with &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP appearing to be more susceptible to the metabolic treatment (growth decreased by 49.49&#x0025; &#x00B1; 2.31 compared to 20.25&#x0025; &#x00B1; 5.24 for WT). This result suggests that accumulation of 2-phospho-D-lactate is toxic to the parasite and that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP plays a key role in maintaining non-toxic levels. However, extracellular concentrations of D-lactate in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cultures are generally below 1 mM indicating that 2-phospho-D-lactate toxicity may not be the major cause of the growth defect of the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant under physiological growth conditions.</p>

<p>An alternative possibility is that the inter-conversion of D-lactate and 2-phospho-D-lactate, mediated by an unknown kinase and <italic>Pf</italic>PGP, has a metabolic function that is required for parasite asexual growth. We hypothesized that D-lactate may be converted to 2-phospho-D-lactate to prevent its secretion with L-lactate. Consistent with this proposal, analysis of the culture medium of uninfected and infected RBC showed that secretion of D-lactate was reduced by &#x223C;75&#x0025; in the latter, indicating that D-lactate may be sequestered within the parasite as 2-phospho-D-lactate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). This finding differed from the previously reported &#x223C;30-fold increase in D-lactate secretion following erythrocyte infection (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Here we deproteinised samples before detection and suspect that without this step, misleadingly high levels of D-lactate are observed due to residual enzyme activity in the media.</p>

<p>4-PE is an inhibitor or allosteric regulator of enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), including 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Consistent with this fact, we observed an increase in 6-phosphogluconate, the substrate for 6-PGD, in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To confirm that 4-PE inhibits 6-PGD directly, we measured the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of 6-PGD in lysates of saponin-lysed trophozoite-infected RBC in the absence and presence of 4-PE. Lysates were incubated with 6-phosphogluconate and increasing concentrations of 4-PE and the conversion of 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose-5-P was assayed by GC-MS (Table S1). Partial inhibition was observed between 5 - 100 &#x03BC;M and complete inhibition at 1 mM 4-PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Neither erythronate nor 2-phospholactate exhibited inhibitory effects in this assay (Fig. S6). These results suggest that the accumulation of 4-PE in &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites (&#x03BC;M range) may partially inhibit activity of 6-PGD <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, our metabolomic studies indicated that levels of downstream intermediates in the oxidative and non-oxidative PPP (ribose-5-P/ribulose-5-P) were elevated, rather than decreased, in &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). An increase in the pool size of these pentose-phosphates could reflect increased flux through the non-oxidative PPP and/or a compensating increase in flux through the oxidative PPP (overcoming the partial inhibition of 6-PGD). To address this question directly, enriched WT- and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP-infected RBC cultures were metabolically labelled with <sup>13</sup>C-1,2-glucose to measure fluxes through both arms of the PPP. Catabolism of <sup>13</sup>C-1,2-glucose through the oxidative arm of the PPP leads to loss of <sup>13</sup>C on carbon-1 of 6-phosphogluconate (as carbon dioxide) as this intermediate is converted to <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-ribose-5-P. In contrast, conversion of <sup>13</sup>C-1,2-glucose to ribose-5-P via the non-oxidative pathway does not involve a decarboxylation step resulting in <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-ribose-5-P (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Purified WT- and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP-infected RBC were incubated with <sup>13</sup>C-1,2-glucose for 30 minutes at 37&#x00B0;C and <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment in ribose-5-P was determined by GC-MS. Ribose-5-P levels were elevated in &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasite cultures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, Table S1), consistent with the results of the initial metabolomic analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The overall rate of turnover of pentose-phosphates were significantly increased in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, M0 fraction). This was entirely due to increased production of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-ribose-5-P (and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-ribose-5-P) and indicates an increased flux through the oxidative PPP. It is notable that the flux through the non-oxidative PPP (as indicated by levels of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-ribose-5-P) was relatively low in both WT and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). These results suggest that inhibition of 6-PGD in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasite lines, due to the accumulation of 4-PE, is more than compensated for by increased flux through this pathway. Therefore, partial inhibition of the oxidative PPP in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP line is an unlikely cause of the decreased growth rate of asexual stages in RBC.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Pf</italic>PGP is associated with changes in glycolytic flux and increased sensitivity to fosmidomycin</title>
<p>The untargeted LC-MS profiling of &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites revealed that DHAP was one of the few metabolites to be significantly down-regulated in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The interconversion of DHAP and GAP is mediated by the glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) which, like 6-PGD, catalyzes a reaction utilizing an ene-diolate intermediate that might be sensitive to allosteric modulation by 4-PE (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). DHAP and other triose-phosphates are catabolyzed in the glycolytic pathway and imported into the apicoplast where they are used for synthesis of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-P, the first committed intermediate in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Conversion of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-P into 2-<italic>C</italic>-methyl-D-erythritol-4-P is inhibited by fosmidomycin, a potent antimalarial (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

We evaluated the sensitivity of &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP-infected RBC to fosmidomycin in a 72-hour drug treatment assay and measured effects upon parasite growth via flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).

<p>To confirm that the metabolic dysregulation of glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway observed in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasite was due to the elevation of 4-PE and not 2-phospho-D-lactate, we incubated WT parasites with D- and L-lactate and performed untargeted LC-MS profiling (Fig. S7). D-lactate incubation led to a selective increase in the phospholactate pool whereas the 4-PE pool remained unchanged. The only other metabolite altered was the D/L-lactate peak itself, indicating that the observed reduction of DHAP and increase in ribose-5-P (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) are most likely the result of 4-PE effects on parasite metabolism.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells express members of the HAD family of metabolite phosphatases, although the function of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> are poorly defined. There is increasing evidence that these enzymes have important roles in regulating intracellular levels of a range of phosphorylated intermediates and metabolic fluxes in cells. In this study, we provide evidence that the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> HAD family member, <italic>Pf</italic>PGP, has at least two functions. First, it participates in a novel metabolic cycle involving the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of D-lactate. Second, it is required to detoxify 4-PE, an allosterically-active metabolic side-product. Targeted deletion of <italic>Pf</italic>PGP resulted in the accumulation of both 2-phospho-D-lactate and 4-PE, attenuated growth of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages, and increased sensitivity to the antimalarial drug, fosmidomycin. Our results identify important differences in the function of PGP in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> compared to other eukaryotes, consistent with a greater dependence of these parasites on non-transcriptional metabolic regulation.</p>
<p>The PGPs were initially identified in plants as enzymes involved in converting phosphoglycolate, a side product of photorespiration, to glycolate (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The subsequent conversion of glycolate to 3-phosphoglycerate and its catabolism in the Calvin-Benson cycle increases the efficiency of plant photorespiration by &#x223C; 25&#x0025;. More recently, studies on the role of PGP in yeast and animal cells have indicated that these enzymes have broader substrate preferences, acting on metabolites such as glycerol-3-phosphate, 2-phospho-L-lactate and 4-PE (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our metabolomic analyses indicate that <italic>Pf</italic>PGP has a similar substrate specificity to the yeast/animal PGPs, although with important differences. In particular, <italic>Pf</italic>PGP appears to act predominantly on the D-enantiomer of 2-phospholactate rather than the L-enantiomer as proposed to occur in animals. L-lactate is the major end-product of glycolysis and 2-phospho-L-lactate is thought to be a minor side product of the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, which normally converts pyruvate to L-lactate (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and other eukaryotes that lack a D-lactate-dehydrogenase, D-lactate is produced exclusively via the methylglyoxal pathway. We provide evidence that the 2-phospho-D-lactate detected in wildtype, &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>GloI and &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutants is likely derived from this pathway. Specifically, incubation of wildtype or &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>GloI mutant parasites with methylglyoxal led to a concomitant increase in 2-phospho-D-lactate levels. Similarly, incubation of wildtype infected RBC with D-lactate, but not L-lactate, elevates intracellular levels of 2-phospho-D-lactate. The latter result indicates that 2-phospho-D-lactate is synthesized directly from D-lactate, via the action of an as yet unidentified kinase, rather than being a side product of pyruvate kinase.</p>
<p>Interestingly, targeted deletion of the cytoplasmic isoform of GloI, the first enzyme in the methylglyoxal pathway, had little effect on the production of 2-phospho-D-lactate. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> express a second GloI enzyme localized to the apicoplast (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which could sustain production of D-lactate and 2-phospho-D-lactate in the &#x0394;GloI mutant. Alternatively, or in addition, the RBC host retains a methylglyoxal pathway, which could convert parasite- and host-derived methylglyoxal to D-lactate. The presence of the host pathway may also explain why the parasite glyoxalases are non-essential, although loss of <italic>gloI</italic> results in significant attenuation of intracellular parasite growth over a long period of time (6 replication cycles). Overall, these findings suggest that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> converts D-lactate generated by the parasite (and potentially host) methylglyoxal pathway(s), to 2-phospho-D-lactate via an as yet unidentified kinase. The 2-phospho-D-lactate is subsequently dephosphorylated by <italic>Pf</italic>PGP to regenerate D-lactate. As D-lactate is not secreted by the parasite, <italic>Pf</italic>PGP may contribute to an ATP-consuming futile metabolic cycle that is directly connected to glycolytic flux (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>What is the potential function of the D-lactate/ 2-phospho-D-lactate cycle in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>? It has recently been shown that 2-phospho-L-lactate (the major phospholactate species in animal cells) inhibits the bi-functional glycolytic enzymes, PFKFB1-4. The enzymes have both phospho-fructo-kinase (PFK) and fructose-2,6-biphosphatase activities and regulate the intracellular levels of the potent PFK allosteric regulator fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lacks a PFKFB homologue, and <italic>Pf</italic>PFK is insensitive to conserved metabolic inhibitors/activators (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), highlighting differences in the way these parasites regulate central carbon metabolism. The metabolic futile cycle catalyzed by PGP may have a direct role in maintaining cellular levels of ATP and in preventing excessive glycolytic flux under conditions of nutrient (glucose) excess. While it is difficult to directly estimate the capacity of this cycle to modulate intracellular ATP levels, it is noteworthy that nearly all of the D-lactate produced by infected RBC is retained intracellularly, despite a 100-fold increase in glycolytic flux (as indicated by glucose uptake and L-lactate secretion) (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This finding suggests that most/all of the D-lactate produced via the parasite methylglyoxal pathway contributes to this cycle. Furthermore, enhanced flux through this pathway, induced by supplementation of infected RBC with D-lactate, led to reduced growth of asexual stages, possibly by increasing ATP cycling. Collectively, these data indicate that the D-lactate/ 2-phospho-D-lactate cycle is very active in these parasite stages and has a significant capacity to modulate ATP levels.</p>
<p>In addition to contributing to the D-lactate/ 2-phospho-D-lactate cycle, <italic>Pf</italic>PGP has a role in regulating intracellular levels of 4-PE. In yeast and animal cells, 4-PE is thought to be generated by the glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH, acting upon the non-standard substrate erythrose-4-P (an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway) (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). 4-PE is a potent negative regulator of the enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In animal PGP- and yeast Pho13- null mutants, the accumulation of 4-PE was proposed to lead to inhibition of the oxidative arm of the PPP (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, loss of <italic>Pf</italic>PGP resulted in a 9-fold (&#x00B1; 1.6) accumulation of 4-PE indicating that it has a similar role in asexual blood stages. However, in contrast to the situation in yeast and animal cells, significant inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>6-PGD activity by 4-PE was only observed at 100 &#x03BC;M <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, the <italic>ex vivo</italic> <sup>13</sup>C-1,2-glucose labelling experiments indicated increased flux through the oxidative PPP in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant line. These analyses suggest that accumulation of 4-PE is insufficient to inhibit 6-PGD under normal <italic>in vivo</italic> growth conditions. It remains to be determined whether 4-PE inhibits other glycolytic/PPP enzymes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that have an ene-diolate intermediate, including triosephosphate isomerase (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) or glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Inhibition of either enzyme could contribute to the reduced glycolytic flux (inferred by the increased sensitivity of &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant to fosmidomycin) or cause the increased flux into the oxidative PPP in the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant and explain the growth defect observed for the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP mutant.</p>
<p>This work highlights the important role of HAD enzymes in regulating <italic>P. falciparum</italic> central carbon metabolism. The role of two other <italic>P. falciparum</italic> HAD enzymes have also recently been examined (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). HAD1, the first member of this class to be functionally characterized in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, promiscuously dephosphorylates a range of glycolytic intermediates <italic>in vitro</italic>, including triose-, pentose- and hexose-phosphates. Loss-of-function mutations in this protein lead to increased parasite resistance to fosmidomycin, and it was proposed that HAD1 has a role in negatively regulating glycolytic flux by removing glycolytic intermediates (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similarly, HAD2 dephosphorylates a range of glycolytic intermediates <italic>in vitro</italic>, and is linked to negative regulation of glycolysis (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A common theme for all three <italic>P. falciparum</italic> HAD proteins characterized to date is their participation in ATP-depleting futile cycles through either depletion of high energy intermediates (HAD1/HAD2) or ATP-dependent cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (<italic>Pf</italic>PGP). Although these futile cycles appear energetically wasteful, they are comparable to other ATP-dependent cycles, such as protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and/or constitutive turnover of mRNA and protein. Metabolic regulation via futile cycling has the potential to be more responsive to subtle changes in carbon sources such as glucose and allows parasites to adapt to changing conditions faster than can be achieved with other forms of metabolic regulation (e.g. transcriptional regulation).</p>
<p>This study highlights the utility of metabolomic approaches in identifying new metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms in evolutionarily divergent eukaryotic parasites. A significant proportion of the genes in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> remain uncharacterized and a significant proportion of metabolites detected in comprehensive LC-MS and GC-MS profiling studies have yet to be structurally defined. Our study indicates that unanticipated complexity in cellular metabolism can arise as a result of enzymatic side reactions and/or chemical modification of canonical metabolites, leading to the evolution of new enzyme activities and pathways. We expect that further dissection of the side activities of the major enzymes in intermediary metabolism in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and associated repair enzymes will provide new insights into the evolution of novel metabolic regulatory processes in these parasites. Such advances will serve an important role in the identification of new, druggable targets for improved malaria therapeutics.</p>

<title>CRISPR and pTEOE plasmid constructs</title>
<p>GloI and PGP knock-out constructs were cloned using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Briefly, the guide RNA (gRNA) and two homology arms flanking the human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cassette were cloned sequentially into the pL7-CS plasmid. The gRNAs were synthetised and cloned into pL7 using BtgZI restriction sites. Each homology arms sequence was amplified by PCR (CloneAmp - Clontech) from freshly prepared NF54 genomic DNA (Isolate II genomic DNA kit - Bioline) and inserted into pL7 at specific restriction sites (homology arm 1: SpeI/AflII &#x2013; homology arm 2: EcoRI/NcoI) using InFusion cloning (Clontech). pUF1-Cas9 was used unmodified (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

<p><bold>Figure S1. <italic>Pf</italic>PGP shares homology with other described PGP enzymes</bold> CLUSTAL alignment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PGP (PF3D7_0715000) with known sequences of yeast Pho13 (YDL236W), mouse AUM (Q8CHP8) and human PGP (NC_000016). The four characteristic HAD motifs (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) framed in red (I to IV) appear to be highly conserved between the compared species.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S2. <italic>Pf</italic>PGP is a cytosolic protein and molecular characterisation of &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasites</bold> a) Western blot of PGP-GFP- (PGP) and WT-infected RBC lysates probed with anti-GFP and anti-GAPDH (loading control). Samples were extracted in either PBS or RIPA buffer. This blot is representative of three independent experiments. b) Schematic of the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP cloning strategy. Legends: CDS = coding sequence; UTR = untranslated regions; hDHFR = resistance cassette; (k)bp = (kilo) base pairs. Features: striped boxes = homology arms; short black line = guide RNA; dotted line between arrows = fragment used for genetic confirmation of the knock-out. c) Genetic confirmation of the disruption of the <italic>pgp</italic> gene by PCR on genomic DNA. A 1 kb DNA ladder was used as reference.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S3. Identification of 2-phospho-D-lactate in wildtype parasites</bold> a) 2-Phospholactate GC-MS spectrum with fingerprint signature. b) 3D7 WT-infected RBC were incubated with D-lactate (1 mM) or left untreated (iRBC condition) and increasing concentrations of a pure 2-phospholactate standard was spiked into cell extracts. The y-axis represents the arbitrary ion counts and the x-axis represents the retention time in minutes for the phospholactate peak.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S4. Molecular characterisation of &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>GloI parasites</bold> a) Schematic of the &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>GloI cloning strategy. Legends: CDS = coding sequence; UTR = untranslated regions; hDHFR = resistance cassette; (k)bp = (kilo) base pairs. Features: striped boxes = homology arms; short black line = guide RNA; dotted line between arrows = fragment used for genetic confirmation of the knock-out. b) Genetic confirmation of the disruption of the <italic>gloI</italic> gene by PCR on genomic DNA. The single band at 1.1 kb in the knockout line only matches the expected 1 145 bp PCR fragment. A 1 kb DNA ladder was used as reference.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S5. Levels of 4-phosphoerythronate are not affected by addition of exogenous D/L lactate</bold> 4-PE levels were measured by GC-MS in &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP- vs WT- infected RBC upon 1-hour incubation at 37&#x00B0;C with 2 mM D- or L-lactate. Data are presented as fold change to the WT - no lactate condition. The mean values &#x00B1; SEM from three to four independent replicates performed on different days are presented.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S6. The inhibition of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is specific to 4-phosphoerythronate</bold> 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase <italic>in vitro</italic> activity was tested on saponin-isolated trophozoite parasites by measurement of the ribulose-5-P product by GC-MS. Parasite lysates were incubated with (left to right): no 4-PE, 1 mM phospholactate (&#x002B;Plac), 1 mM erythronate (&#x002B;Ery), no NADP and no reaction buffer (lysate). Results are normalised to the no 4-PE condition (100&#x0025;). Data are presented as the mean &#x00B1; SEM from three independent experiments performed on different days.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S7. The increase in 2-phospho-D-lactate is not responsible for metabolic dysregulations observed in &#x0394;<italic>Pf</italic>PGP parasite cultures</bold> WT-infected RBC were subjected to a 1-hour treatment with 10 mM L- or D-lactate and metabolically compared to a no-treatment condition (control treated) by untargeted LC-MS. Scatter plots of <italic>m/z</italic> ion counts are presented. Following both D- and L-lactate exposure, the intracellular lactate pool was significantly elevated (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.05 Benjamini corrected). Phospholactate was significantly elevated only following D-lactate incubation (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 0.05 Benjamini corrected). Each scatter plot represents averaged data from three (L-lactate) and four (D-lactate) independent biological replicates.</p>

<p><bold>Table S2. Primer list</bold> Primers are presented by section. For the CRISPR and pTEOE cloning sections, InFusion primers were designed. Upper cases are nucleotides that are part of the plasmid backbone, lower cases are nucleotides that are part of the gene-of-interest, underlined nucleotides correspond to restriction sites, and for GloI_HA1_rev_AflII the nucleotides in blue are mutated nucleotides.</p>
