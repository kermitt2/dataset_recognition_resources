<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The diversity of life on Earth is a result of continual innovations in molecular networks influencing morphology and physiology. Plant specialized metabolism produces hundreds of thousands of compounds, offering striking examples of these innovations. To understand how this novelty is generated, we investigated the evolution of the Solanaceae family-specific, trichome-localized acylsugar biosynthetic pathway using a combination of mass spectrometry, RNA-seq, enzyme assays, RNAi and phylogenetics in non-model species. Our results reveal that hundreds of acylsugars are produced across the Solanaceae family and even within a single plant, revealing this phenotype to be hyper-diverse. The relatively short biosynthetic pathway experienced repeated cycles of innovation over the last 100 million years that include gene duplication and divergence, gene loss, evolution of substrate preference and promiscuity. This study provides mechanistic insights into the emergence of plant chemical novelty, and offers a template for investigating the &#x223C;300,000 non-model plant species that remain underexplored.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first proto-life forms arose on our planet some four billion years ago, the forces of mutation, selection and drift have generated a world of rich biological complexity. This complexity, evident at all levels of biological organization, has intrigued humans for millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tipton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mayr, 1985</xref>). Plant metabolism, estimated to produce hundreds of thousands of products with diverse structures across the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fiehn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afendi et al., 2012</xref>), provides striking examples of this complexity. Plant metabolism is traditionally divided into primary and secondary/specialized, the former referring to production of compounds essential for plant development and the latter encompassing metabolites documented as important for plant survival in nature and metabolites of as yet unknown functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pichersky and Lewinsohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>). While primary metabolism generally consists of highly conserved pathways and enzymes, specialized metabolic pathways are in a state of continuous innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Milo and Last, 2012</xref>). This dynamism produced numerous lineage-specific metabolite classes such as steroidal glycoalkaloids in Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wink, 2003</xref>), benzoxazinoid alkaloids in Poaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dutartre et al., 2012</xref>), betalains in Caryophyllales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brockington et al., 2015</xref>) and glucosinolates in Brassicales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>). The structural diversity produced by lineage-specific pathways makes them exemplary systems for understanding the evolution of novelty in the living world.</p>
<p>Previous studies investigating the emergence of lineage-specific metabolite classes uncovered the central role of gene duplication and diversification in this process: e.g. duplications of isopropylmalate synthase (glucosinolates and acylsugars), cycloartenol synthase (avenacin), tryptophan synthase (benzoxazinoids) and anthranilate synthase (acridone alkaloids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>). Duplications of members of enzyme families (e.g. cytochromes P450, glycosyltransferases, methyltransferases, BAHD acyltransferases) also play major roles in generating chemical novelty, with biosynthesis of &#x003E;40,000 structurally diverse terpenoids &#x2014; produced partly due to genomic clustering of terpene synthases and cytochrome P450 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boutanaev et al., 2015</xref>) &#x2014; as an extreme example. These duplicate genes, if retained, may experience sub- or neo-functionalization via transcriptional divergence and evolution of protein-protein interactions as well as via changes in substrate preference, reaction mechanism and allosteric regulation to produce chemical novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moghe and Last, 2015</xref>). In this study, we sought to understand the molecular processes by which a novel class of metabolites &#x2014; acylsugars &#x2014; emerged in the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>Acylsugars are lineage-specific plant specialized metabolites detected in multiple genera of the Solanaceae family including <italic>Solanum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">King et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schilmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Petunia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kroumova and Wagner, 2003</xref>), <italic>Datura</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Forkner and Hare, 2000</xref>) and <italic>Nicotiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kroumova and Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kroumova et al., 2016</xref>). These compounds, produced in the tip cell of trichomes on leaf and stem surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>), typically consist of a sucrose or glucose core esterified to groups derived from fatty acid or branched chain amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Multiple studies demonstrated that acylsugars mediate plant-insect and plant-fungus interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Puterka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Simmons et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weinhold and Baldwin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leckie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luu et al., 2017</xref>), with their structural diversity documented as functionally important in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Puterka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leckie et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Acylsugars, compared to other specialized metabolic classes such as alkaloids, phenylpropanoids and glucosinolates, are biosynthetically rather simple. These compounds are produced by a set of enzymes called acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs), which catalyze sequential addition of acyl chains to the sucrose molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). ASATs are members of Clade III of the large and functionally diverse BAHD enzyme family ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">St Pierre and De Luca, 2000;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">D&#x2019;Auria, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S1">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1</xref>). Despite their evolutionary relatedness, <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> ASATs (SlASATs) are only &#x223C;40&#x0025; identical to each other at the protein level. ASATs exhibit different activities across wild tomatoes due to ortholog divergence, gene duplication and neo-functionalization, leading to divergence in acceptor and donor substrate repertoire of ASATs between wild tomato species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). In addition, loss of an ASAT enzyme also contributed to diversification of acylsugar phenotypes between individuals of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). This diversity, primarily studied in closely related wild tomato species and underexplored in the broader Solanaceae family, creates opportunities for further exploration of the mechanisms generating biological complexity and variation.</p>
<p>Previous studies of acylsugar biosynthesis primarily focused on closely related <italic>Solanum</italic> species. In this study, we sought to understand the timeline for emergence of the ASAT activities and explore the evolution of the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway since the origin of the Solanaceae. Typically, significant hits obtained using BLAST searches are analyzed in a phylogenetic context to understand enzyme origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ober and Hartmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Qi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benderoth et al., 2006</xref>). However, ASAT orthologs can experience functional diversification due to single amino acid changes and/or duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>), precluding functional assignment based on sequence similarity. Thus, we inferred the origins and evolution of the pathway with a bottom-up approach; starting by assessing the diversity of acylsugar phenotypes across the family using mass spectrometry. Our findings illustrate the varied mechanisms by which this specialized metabolic pathway evolved and have implications for the study of chemical novelty in the plant kingdom.</p>

<title>Diversity of acylsugar profiles across the Solanaceae</title>
<p>While the Solanaceae family comprises 98 genera and &#x003E;2700 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Olmstead and Bohs, 2007</xref>), there are extensive descriptions of acylsugar diversity reported for only a handful of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Severson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">King et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shinozaki et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we sampled vegetative tissue surface metabolites from single plants of 35 Solanaceae and four Convolvulaceae species. These species were sampled at the New York Botanical Gardens and Michigan State University (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Figure 1-File Supplement 1A), and acylsugar profiles were obtained using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with collision-induced dissociation (CID; see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schilmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan et al., 2016b</xref>). Molecular and substructure (fragment) masses obtained by LC/MS-CID were used to annotate acylsugars in <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>, <italic>Solanum quitoense</italic>, <italic>Physalis alkekengi</italic>, <italic>Physalis viscosa, Iochroma cyaneum</italic>, <italic>Atropa belladonna</italic>, <italic>Nicotiana alata</italic>, <italic>Hyoscyamus niger</italic> and <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic> (Salpiglossis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>; <bold>Figure 1-Source Data 1</bold>). Plant extracts without detectable acylsugars generally lacked glandular trichomes (Fisher Exact Test p=2.3e-6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S1">Figure 1-File Supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, the acylsugar phenotype is quite dynamic and can be affected by factors such as developmental stage, environmental conditions and the specific accession sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>). These factors may also influence the detection of acylsugars in some species.</p>
<p>The suite of detected acylsugars exhibited substantial diversity, both in molecular and fragment ion masses. Most species accumulated acylsugars with mass spectra consistent with disaccharide cores &#x2014; most likely sucrose &#x2014; esterified with short- to medium-chain aliphatic acyl groups, similar to previously characterized acylsugars in cultivated and wild tomatoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schilmiller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). However, <italic>S. nigrum</italic> acylsugar data suggested exclusive accumulation of acylhexoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with fragmentation patterns similar to previously analyzed <italic>S. pennellii</italic> acylglucoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>). Mass spectra of <italic>S. quitoense</italic> acylsugars also revealed acylsugars with features distinct from any known acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>), and structures of these will be described in detail in a separate report. In total, more than 100 acylsucroses and at least 20 acylsugars of other forms were annotated with number and lengths of acyl groups based on pseudomolecular and fragment ion masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). Several hundred additional low-abundance isomers and novel acylsugars were also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S3">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 3</xref>). For example, in Salpiglossis alone, &#x003E;400 chromatographic peaks had <italic>m/z</italic> ratios and mass defects consistent with acylsugars <bold>(For review only - Additional File 1)</bold>. This diversity is notable when compared to &#x223C;33 detected acylsucroses in cultivated tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Mass spectra also revealed substantial diversity in the number and lengths of acyl chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). Based on negative ion mode data, the number of acyl chains on the sugar cores ranged from two to six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>), with chain lengths from 2-12 carbons. Across the Solanaceae, we found species that incorporate at least one common aliphatic acyl chain in all their major acylsugars: e.g. chains of length C5 in <italic>A. belladonna</italic>, C4 in <italic>P. viscosa</italic>, and C8 in <italic>P. alkekengi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). Longer C10 and C12 chain-containing acylsugars were found in multiple species (<italic>P. viscosa</italic>, <italic>A. belladonna</italic>, <italic>H. niger</italic>, <italic>S. nigrum</italic> and <italic>S. quitoense</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S2">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). Mass spectra consistent with acylsugars containing novel acyl chains were also detected. While we could not differentiate between acyl chain isomers (e.g. <italic>iso</italic>-C5 [iC5] vs. <italic>anteiso</italic>-C5 [aiC5]) based on CID fragmentation patterns, our data reveal large acyl chain diversity in acylsugars across the Solanaceae. Such diversity can result from differences in the intracellular concentrations of acyl CoA pools or divergent substrate specificities of individual ASATs. A previous study from our lab identified allelic variation in the enzyme isopropylmalatesynthase3, which contributes to differences in abundances of iC5 or iC4 chains in acylsugars of <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> and some <italic>S. pennellii</italic> accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>ASAT</italic> gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>), gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) and single residue changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>) also influence chain diversity in acylsugars, illustrating the various ways by which acylsugar phenotypes may be generated in the Solanaceae.</p>
<p>Published data from <italic>S. pennellii</italic> and <italic>S. habrochaites</italic> revealed differences in furanose ring acylation on acylsucroses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>). Ring-specific acylation patterns can be evaluated using positive mode mass spectrometry and CID, which generates fragment ion masses from cleavage of the glycosidic linkage. We found furanose ring acylation in almost all tested species in Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S4">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 4A-E</xref>); however, the lengths of acyl chains on the ring varied. All tri-acylsucroses analyzed using positive mode CID data bore all acyl chains on one ring, likely the pyranose ring &#x2014; as evidenced by neutral loss of 197 Da (hexose plus NH<sub>3</sub>) from the [M&#x002B;NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ion &#x2014; unlike <italic>S. lycopersicum,</italic> which bears one acyl chain on the furanose ring. However, the substituents varied among tetra- and penta-acylsugars of different species, with some (e.g.: <italic>N. alata</italic>), showing up to four chains on the same ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S4">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 4A</xref>), and others (e.g.: <italic>H. niger</italic>, Salpiglossis) revealing spectra consistent with acylation on both pyranose and furanose rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1S4">Figure 1-Figure Supplement 4B,C</xref>).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate the substantial acylsugar diversity across the Solanaceae family. To identify the enzymes that contribute to this diversity, we performed RNA-seq in four phylogenetically-spaced species with interesting acylsugar profiles, namely <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, <italic>S. quitoense</italic>, <italic>H. niger</italic> and Salpiglossis.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic profiling of trichomes from multiple Solanaceae species</title>
<p>Our previous studies in cultivated tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schilmiller et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>) demonstrated that identifying genes with expression enriched in stem/petiole trichomes compared to shaved stem/petiole without trichomes is a productive way to find acylsugar biosynthetic enzymes. We sampled polyA RNA from these tissues from four species and performed <italic>de novo</italic> read assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These assemblies were used to find transcripts preferentially expressed in the trichomes (referred to as &#x201C;trichome-high transcripts&#x201D;) and to develop hypotheses regarding their functions based on homology.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Overall, 1888-3547 trichome-high transcripts (22-37&#x0025; of all differentially expressed transcripts) were identified across all four species (False Discovery Rate adjusted p&#x003C;0.05, fold change&#x2265;2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These transcripts were subjected to a detailed analysis including coding sequence prediction, binning into 25,838 orthologous groups, assignment of putative functions based on tomato gene annotation and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (see Methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Analysis of the enriched categories (Fisher exact test corrected p&#x003C;0.05) revealed that only 20 of 70 well-supported categories (&#x2265;10 transcripts) were enriched in at least three species <bold>(Table 1-File Supplement 1)</bold>, suggesting existence of diverse transcriptional programs in the trichomes at the time of their sampling. Almost all enriched categories were related to metabolism, protein modification or transport, with metabolism-related categories being dominant <bold>(Table 1-File Supplement 1)</bold>. These results support the notion of trichomes as &#x201C;chemical factories&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schilmiller et al., 2008</xref>) and point to the metabolic diversity that might exist in trichomes across the Solanaceae.</p>
<p>A major goal of this study was to define the organization of the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway at the origin of the Solanaceae, prompting us to focus on Salpiglossis, whose phylogenetic position is of special interest in inferring the ancestral state of the biosynthetic pathway. We first validated the plant under study as Salpiglossis using a phylogeny based on <italic>ndhF</italic> and <italic>trnLF</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1A,B</xref>). A previously published maximum likelihood tree of 1075 Solanaceae species suggested <italic>Salpiglossis</italic> as an extant species of the earliest diverging lineage in Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">S&#x00E4;rkinen et al., 2013</xref>). However, some tree reconstruction approaches show <italic>Duckeodendron</italic> and <italic>Schwenckia</italic> as emerging from the earliest diverging lineages, and Salpiglossis and Petunioideae closely related to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Olmstead et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">S&#x00E4;rkinen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, our further interpretations are restricted to the last common ancestor of Salpiglossis-Petunia-Tomato (hereafter referred to as the Last Common Ancestor [LCA]) that existed &#x223C;22-28 mya. To infer the ancestral state of the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway in the LCA, we characterized the pathway in Salpiglossis using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic> approaches.</p>

<p>The acylsugar structural diversity and phylogenetic position of Salpiglossis led us to characterize the biosynthetic pathway of this species. NMR analysis of Salpiglossis acylsugars revealed acylation at the R2, R3, R4 positions on the pyranose ring and R1&#x2032;, R3&#x2032;, R6&#x2032; positions on the furanose ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2TS1">Figure 2A-Table Supplement 1</xref>) (For review only &#x2013; Additional File 1). The acylation positions are reminiscent of <italic>Petunia axillaris</italic> (Pa) acylsucroses where PaASAT1, PaASAT2, PaASAT3 and PaASAT4 acylate with aliphatic precursors at R2, R4, R3 and R6 on the six-carbon pyranose ring, respectively <bold>(For review only &#x2013; Additional File 2)</bold>. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that PaASAT1,2,3 orthologs in Salpiglossis function as SsASAT1,2,3 respectively.</p>

<p>Thirteen Salpiglossis trichome-high BAHD family members were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2- Figure Supplement 1C</xref>), with nine expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2TS2">Figure 2-Table Supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2F1">Figure 2-File Supplements 1,2</xref>). Activities of the purified enzymes were tested using sucrose or partially acylated sucroses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2016b</xref>) as acceptor substrates. Donor C2, aiC5 and aiC6 acyl CoA substrates were tested based on the common occurrence of these ester groups in a set of 16 Salpiglossis acylsucroses purified for NMR <bold>(For review only &#x2013; Additional File 1)</bold>. Representative NMR structures that illustrate the SsASAT positional selectivity described in the results below are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Four of the tested candidates catalyzed ASAT reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">E</xref>). In the following description, we name the enzymes based on their order of acylation in the Salpiglossis acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. A description is provided in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 2</xref></bold> to assist in understanding the chromatograms.</p>
<p><italic><underline>S</underline>alpiglossis <underline>s</underline>inuata</italic> ASAT1 (SsASAT1) generated mono-acylsugars from sucrose using multiple acyl CoAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Figure 2-Figure Supplements 2,3), similar to the donor substrate diversity of SlASAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). We infer that SsASAT1 primarily acylates the R2 position on the pyranose ring. This is based on (a) the S1:6(6) negative mode CID fragmentation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 3A</xref>) and (b) comparisons of chromatographic migration of the mono-acylsucroses produced by SsASAT1, PaASAT1, which acylates sucrose at R2 and matches the major SsASAT1 product, and SlASAT1, which acylates sucrose at R4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 3A,B</xref>) (<bold>For review only - Additional File 2)</bold>. This activity is similar to <italic>P. axillaris</italic> PaASAT1 and unlike <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> SlASAT1.</p>
<p>SsASAT2 was identified by testing the ability of each of the other eight cloned enzymes to acylate the mono-acylated product of SsASAT1 (S1:5 or S1:6) as acyl acceptor and using aiC5 CoA as acyl donor. SsASAT2 catalyzed the formation of di-acylated sugars, which co-eluted with the PaASAT2 product but not with the SlASAT2 product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 3C,D</xref>). Positive mode fragmentation suggested that the acylation occurs on the same ring as SsASAT1 acylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 3C</xref>). This enzyme failed to acylate sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S4"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S4">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 4</xref></xref>), supporting its assignment as SsASAT2.</p>
<p>SsASAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red chromatogram) added aiC6 to the pyranose ring of the di-acylated sugar acceptor. This aiC6 acylation reaction is in concordance with the observed <italic>in planta</italic> acylation pattern at the R3 position &#x2014; aiC6 is present at this position in the majority of <italic>S. sinuata</italic> acylsugars <bold>(For review only &#x2013; Additional File 1)</bold>. Surprisingly, the enzyme did not use aiC5 CoA, despite the identification of S3:15(5,5,5) and likely its acylated derivates [S4:20(5,5,5,5), S4:17(2,5,5,5), S5:22(2,5,5,5,5) and S5:19(2,2,5,5,5)] from <italic>S. sinuata</italic> extracts <bold>(For review only &#x2013; Additional File 1)</bold>. SsASAT3-dependent R3 position acylation was further confirmed by testing the tri-acylated product with PaASAT4, which acylates at the R6 position of the pyranose ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S5"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S5">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 5</xref></xref>) (For review only &#x2013; Additional File 2). The successful R6 acylation by PaASAT4 is consistent with the hypothesis that SsASAT3 acylates the R3 position. Taken together, these results suggest that the first three enzymes generate acylsugars with aiC5/aiC6 at the R2 position (SsASAT1), aiC6 at the R3 position (SsASAT3) and aiC5/aiC6 at the R4 position (SsASAT2).</p>
<p>We could not identify the SsASAT4 enzyme(s) that performs aiC5 and C2 acylations on the R1&#x2032; and R3&#x2032; positions of tri-acylsucroses, respectively. However, we identified another enzyme, which we designate SsASAT5, that showed three activities acetylating tri-, tetra- and penta-acylsucroses (see Methods). SsASAT5 can perform furanose ring acetylation on tri- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S6">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 6A,B</xref>) and tetra-acylsucroses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), and both furanose as well as pyranose ring acetylation on penta-acylsucroses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S6">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 6C-F</xref>). All of the products produced by SsASAT5 <italic>in vitro</italic> co-migrate with acylsugars found in plant extracts, suggesting the SsASAT5 acceptor promiscuity also occurs <italic>in planta</italic>. Our observation that SsASAT5 can perform pyranose ring acetylation &#x2014; albeit weakly <bold>(Figure 2-Figure Supplements 6D,F)</bold> &#x2014; is at odds with NMR-characterized structures of a set of 16 purified Salpiglossis acylsugars, which show all acetyl groups on the furanose ring. However, a previous study described one pyranose R6-acylated penta-acyl sugar S5:22(2,2,6,6,6) in Salpiglossis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Castillo et al., 1989</xref>), suggesting the presence of accession-specific variation in enzyme function. Despite showing SsASAT4-, SsASAT5- and SsASAT6-like activities, we designate this enzyme SsASAT5 because its products have both acylation patterns and co-migration characteristics consistent with the most abundant penta-acylsugars from the plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis revealed four enzymes that could catalyze ASAT reactions and produce compounds also detected in plant extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We further verified that these enzymes are involved in acylsugar biosynthesis by testing the effects of perturbing their transcript levels using Virus Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS).</p>

The Salpiglossis ortholog of the tomato phytoene desaturase (PDS) carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme was used as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with transcript level decreases confirmed for each candidate using qRT-PCR in one of the VIGS replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

<p>SsASAT1 VIGS revealed statistically significant reductions in acylsugar levels in at least one construct across two experimental replicates (Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test, p-value &#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-Figure Supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with its predicted role in catalyzing the first step in acylsugar biosynthesis. <italic>SsASAT2</italic> expression reduction also produced plants with an overall decrease in acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-Figure Supplement 1B</xref>). However, these plants also showed some additional unexpected acylsugar phenotypes, namely increases in lower molecular weight acylsugars (<italic>m/z</italic> ratio: 651-700, 701-750; KS test p&#x003C;0.05), decreases in levels of higher molecular weight products (<italic>m/z</italic> ratio: 751-800, 801-850) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) as well as changes in levels of some individual acylsugars as described in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3-Figure Supplement 2</xref></bold>. These results provide <italic>in planta</italic> support for the involvement of SsASAT2 in acylsugar biosynthesis, and suggest the possibility of discovering additional complexity in the future.</p>
<p>Silencing the <italic>SsASAT3</italic> transcript also led to an unexpected result - significantly higher accumulation of the normally very low abundance tri-acylsugars [S3:13(2,5,6); S3:14(2,6,6); S3:15(5,5,5); S3:16(5,5,6); S3:18(6,6,6)] and their acetylated tetra-acylsugar derivatives (KS test p&#x003C;0.05), compared to empty vector control infiltrated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4-Figure Supplement 1</xref>). The tetra-acylsugars contained C2 or C5 acylation on the furanose ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S2">Figure 4-Figure Supplement 2</xref>). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that di-acylated sugars accumulate upon SsASAT3 knockdown and then serve as substrate for one or more other enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3">Figure 4-Figure Supplement 3</xref></xref>). Our working hypothesis is that this inferred activity is the as-yet-unidentified SsASAT4 activity; this is based on comparisons of <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assay products and <italic>in vivo</italic> purified acylsugars from Salpiglossis plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (For review only &#x2013; Additional File 1).

<p>SsASAT5, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis, was proposed to catalyze acetylation of tetra- to penta-acylsugars. As expected, its knockdown led to accumulation of tri- and tetra-acylsugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3">Figure 4-Figure Supplement 3B</xref>). The accumulating tetra-acylsugars were C2/C5 furanose ring-acylated derivatives of the tri-acylsugars, suggesting presence of a functional SsASAT4 enzyme and further validating the annotation of the knocked down enzyme as SsASAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S3">Figure 4-Figure Supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, in summary, we identified four ASAT enzymes and validated their impact on acylsugar biosynthesis in Salpiglossis trichomes using VIGS.</p>
<p>Taken together, the Salpiglossis metabolites produced <italic>in vivo</italic>, combined with <italic>in vitro</italic> and RNAi results, lead to the model of the Salpiglossis acylsugar biosynthetic network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. SsASAT1 &#x2013; the first enzyme in the network &#x2013; adds aiC5 or aiC6 to the sucrose R2 position. SsASAT2 then converts this mono-acylated sucrose to a di-acylated product, via addition of aiC5 or aiC6 at the R4 position. Four possible products are thus generated by the first two enzymes alone. Next, the SsASAT3 activity adds aiC6 at the R3 position, followed by one or more uncharacterized enzyme(s) that adds either C2 or aiC5 at the furanose ring R1&#x2032; or R3&#x2032; positions, respectively. SsASAT5 next performs acetylation at the R6&#x2032; position to produce penta-acylsugars, which can then be further converted by an uncharacterized SsASAT6 to hexa-acylsugars via C2 addition at the R3&#x2032; position.</p>

<p>Our results are consistent with the existence of at least two additional activities &#x2013; SsASAT4 and SsASAT6. These enzymes may be included in the five BAHD family candidates highly expressed in both the trichome and stem (average number of reads &#x003E; 500), and thus not selected for our study because they did not meet the differential expression criterion. Also, the fact that there are &#x003E;400 detectable acylsugar-like peaks in the Salpiglossis trichome extracts suggests the existence of additional ASAT activities, either promiscuous activities of characterized ASATs or of other uncharacterized enzymes. Nonetheless, identification of the four primary ASAT activities can help us to investigate the origins and evolution of the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway over time.</p>

<p>Three major subclades in the gene tree &#x2013; highlighted in blue, red and pink &#x2013; are relevant to understanding the origins of the ASATs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A majority of characterized ASATs (<bold>blue squares in the blue subclade</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) are clustered with <italic>Capsicum</italic> PUN1 &#x2014; an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the alkaloid capsaicin &#x2014; in a monophyletic group with high bootstrap support (Group #1, red and blue subclades <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Two of the most closely related non-Solanales enzymes in the tree &#x2014; <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> minovincinine-19-O-acetyltransferase (MAT) and deacetylvindoline-4-O-acetyltransferase (DAT) &#x2014; are also involved in alkaloid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Magnotta et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that the blue ASAT subclade emerged from an alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme ancestor.</p>
<p>A second insight from the gene tree involves Salpiglossis SsASAT5 and tomato SlASAT4, which reside outside of the blue subclade. Both enzymes catalyze C2 addition on acylated sugar substrates in downstream reactions of their respective networks. Multiple enzymes in this region of the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1C</xref>; light blue clade) are involved in <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of diverse substrates e.g. indole alkaloid 16-epivellosimine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bayer et al., 2004</xref>), the phenylpropanoid benzyl alcohol (D&#x2019;Auria et al., 2002) and the terpene geraniol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shalit et al., 2003</xref>).

We used historical dates as described by S&#x00E4;rkinen and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">S&#x00E4;rkinen et al., 2013</xref>) in our interpretations, as opposed to a recent study that described a much earlier origination time for the Solanaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wilf et al., 2017</xref>). Based on known relationships, Convolvulaceae is the closest sister family to Solanaceae; however, we found no putative ASAT orthologs in any searched Convolvulaceae species. The closest Convolvulaceae homologs were found in the <italic>Ipomoea trifida</italic> genome (Hirakawa et al., 2015) in the red subclade. This suggests that the blue and red subclades arose via a duplication event before the Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae split, estimated to be &#x223C;50-65 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">S&#x00E4;rkinen et al., 2013</xref>). The lack of ASAT orthologs in Convolvulaceae could indicate that Convolvulaceae species with an orthologous acylsugar biosynthetic pathway were not sampled in our analysis. Alternatively, the absence of orthologs of the blue subclade enzymes in the Convolvulaceae, coupled with the lack of acylsugars in the sampled Convolvulaceae species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), leads us to hypothesize that ASAT orthologs were likely lost early in Convolvulaceae evolution.</p>
<p>The known phylogenetic relationships between species can help assign a maximum age for the duplication event leading to the blue and red subclades. Database searches identified homologs from species in the Boraginales (<italic>Ehretia</italic>, <italic>Heliotropium</italic>) and Gentianales (<italic>Coffea, Catharanthus</italic>) orders that clustered outside Group #1, in a monophyletic group with high bootstrap support (Group #2, pink branches, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Boraginales is sister to the Lamiales order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and although Boraginales putative orthologs were identified through BLAST searches, no orthologs from Lamiales species were detected. The closest Lamiales (<italic>Sesamum, Lavandula, Mimulus</italic>) homologs were more closely related to SsASAT5 than to the ASATs in the blue subclade (<bold>purple squares</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation for these observations is that the duplication event that gave rise to the blue and red subclades occurred before the Solanaceae-Convolvulaceae split 50-65 mya but after the Solanales-Boraginales/Lamiales orders diverged 75-100 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hedges et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these observations support a view of the origins of the ASAT1,2,3 blue subclade from an alkaloid biosynthetic ancestor via a single duplication event &#x003E;50mya, prior to the establishment of the Solanaceae. This duplicate would have undergone further rounds of duplication to generate the multiple ASATs found in the blue subclade. Thus, a logical next question is &#x2018;what was the structure of the acylsugar biosynthetic network early in the Solanaceae family evolution?&#x2019; To address this, we focused on ASAT evolution across the Solanaceae family.</p>

<title>Evolution of acylsugar biosynthesis in the Solanaceae</title>
<p>ASAT enzymes in the blue subclade represent the first three steps in the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. The likely status of these three steps in the Salpiglossis-Petunia-Tomato last common ancestor (LCA) was investigated using the gene tree displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Mapping the pathway enzymes on the gene tree suggests that the LCA likely had at least three enzymatic activities, which we refer to as ancestral ASAT1 (aASAT1), ASAT2 (aASAT2) and ASAT3 (aASAT3); these are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> as red, dark blue and yellow squares, respectively. We further traced the evolution of the aASAT1,2,3 orthologs in the Solanaceae using existing functional data and BLAST-based searches. These results reveal that the aASAT1 ortholog (red squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) was present until the <italic>Capsicum</italic>-<italic>Solanum</italic> split &#x223C;17 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">S&#x00E4;rkinen et al., 2013</xref>) and was lost in the lineage leading to <italic>Solanum</italic>. This loss is evident both in similarity searches and in comparisons of syntenic regions between genomes of Petunia, <italic>Capsicum</italic> and tomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). On the other hand, the aASAT2 (dark blue squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and aASAT3 orthologs (yellow squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) have been present in the Solanaceae species genomes at least since the last common ancestor of Salpiglossis-Petunia-Tomato &#x223C;25 mya, and perhaps even in the last common ancestor of the Solanaceae family.</p>

<p>One inference from this analysis is that aASAT2 orthologs switched their activity from ASAT2-like acylation of mono-acylsucroses in Salpiglossis/Petunia to ASAT1-like acylation of unsubstituted sucrose in cultivated tomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, despite the switch, both aASAT2 and aASAT3 orthologs in tomato continue to acylate the same pyranose-ring R4 and R3 positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, cultivated tomato has two &#x2018;new&#x2019; enzymes &#x2014; SlASAT3 and SlASAT4 &#x2014; which were not described in Petunia or Salpiglossis acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

<p>The functional transitions of aASAT2 and aASAT3 could have occurred via (i) functional divergence between orthologs or (ii) duplication, neo-functionalization and loss of the ancestral enzyme. Counter to the second hypothesis, we found no evidence of aASAT2 ortholog duplication in the genomic datasets; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of recent polyploidy in extant species producing duplicate genes with divergent functions. We explored the more parsimonious hypothesis that functional divergence between orthologs led to the aASAT2 functional switch.</p>
<p>Functional divergence between aASAT2 orthologs may have occurred by one of two mechanisms. One, it is possible that aASAT2 orthologs had weak/strong sucrose acylation activity prior to aASAT1 loss. Alternatively, sucrose acylation activity arose completely anew after the loss of aASAT1. We sought evidence for acceptor substrate promiscuity in extant species by characterizing the activity of additional orthologous aASAT2 enzymes from <italic>H. niger</italic> and <italic>S. nigrum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) using aiC6 and nC12 as acyl CoA donors. HnASAT2 &#x2014; like SsASAT2 &#x2014; only performed the ASAT2 reaction (acylation of mono-acylsucrose), without any evidence for sucrose acylation under standard testing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7S1">Figure 7-Figure Supplement 1A-D</xref>). However, both SnASAT1 and SlASAT1 could produce S1:6(6) and S1:12(12) from sucrose.</p>
<p>Overall, these results suggest that up until Atropina-Solaneae common ancestor, the aASAT2 ortholog still primarily conducted the ASAT2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, at some point, the aASAT2 ortholog moved in reaction space towards being ASAT1. This activity shift was likely complete by the time the <italic>S.nigrum</italic>-<italic>S.lycopersicum</italic> lineage diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), given that aASAT2 orthologs in both species utilize sucrose. Future detailed characterization of aASAT2 orthologs from phylogenetically intermediate, pre-and post-aASAT1 loss species can help pinpoint the route taken by the aASAT2 ortholog in its functional diversification as well as determine whether positive selection played a role.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We performed experimental and computational analysis of BAHD enzymes from several lineages spanning &#x223C;100 million years, and characterized the emergence and evolution of the acylsugar metabolic network. We identified four biosynthetic enzymes in <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic>, the extant species of an early emerging Solanaceae lineage, characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> activities, validated <italic>in planta</italic> roles of these ASATs and studied their emergence over 100 million years of plant evolution. These results demonstrate the value of leveraging genomics, phylogenetics, analytical chemistry and enzymology with a mix of model and non-model organisms to understand the evolution of biological complexity.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, the acylsugar phenotype across the Solanaceae is &#x201C;hyper-diverse&#x201D;, meaning there is large diversity within and between closely related species. Previous studies indicate that all eight hydroxyls on the sucrose core are subject to acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fan et al., 2016a</xref>). A simple calculation (see Supplemental Methods) considering only 12 aliphatic CoA donors suggests &#x003E;6000 theoretical possible structures for tetra-acylsugars alone. This estimate does not even include estimates of tri-, penta-, hexa-acylsugars nor does it consider non-aliphatic CoAs such as malonyl CoA, esters of other sugars such as glucose or positional isomers. Although the theoretical possibilities are restricted by availability of CoAs in trichome tip cells and existing ASAT activities, we still observe hundreds of acylsugars across the Solanaceae, with &#x003E;400 detectable acylsugar-like chromatographic peaks in single plants of Salpiglossis and <italic>N. alata</italic>, including very low abundance hepta-acylsugars and acylsugars containing phenylacetyl and tigloyl chains <bold>(For review only &#x2013; Additional File 1)</bold>. This diversity may be less than among some terpenoid classes e.g. &#x003E;850 diterpenes have been described in different members of the <italic>Euphorbia</italic> genus alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Vasas and Hohmann, 2014</xref>). However, the diversity is significantly greater than other specialized metabolite classes restricted to a single clade such as glucosinolates in Brassicales (&#x223C;150 across the order) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Olsen et al., 2016</xref>), betalains in Caryophyllales (&#x223C;75 non-glycosylated betalains across the order) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Khan and Giridhar, 2015</xref>) and acridone alkaloids in Rutaceae (&#x223C;100 in the family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>). Acylsugar diversity may be higher than, or at least comparable to, resin glycosides in Convolvulaceae (&#x003E;250 structures across the family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pereda-Miranda et al., 2010</xref>) and pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Boraginaceae (&#x003E;225 structures across the family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Shazly and Wink, 2014</xref>). Much of the observed acylsugar phenotypic complexity arises due to the diversity in acyl chains &#x2014; their types, lengths, isomeric forms and positions on the sucrose molecule.</p>
<p>Does such immense diversity within the same metabolite class serve a purpose? Glucosinolate diversity was shown to influence fitness in the wild (Prasad et al., 2012) but pyrrolizidine alkaloid diversity may not be so relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Macel et al., 2002</xref>). While acylsugar diversity is ecologically relevant to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weinhold and Baldwin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Leckie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luu et al., 2017</xref>), it is unlikely that each novel acylsugar has a specific function. The diversity &#x2014; perhaps occurring as an unintended consequence of ASAT promiscuity &#x2014; may, in some cases, also provide benefit in the form of physical defense (e.g. stickiness).</p>
<p>We studied the question of how acylsugar biosynthesis originated. The results provide evidence for repeated cycles of innovation involving potentiation, actualization and refinement that contributed to the origin and diversification of the acylsugar biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blount et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We propose that the ASAT enzymes catalyzing sucrose acylation first emerged (or actualized) between 30-80 mya. Events prior to the emergence of this activity &#x2014; including existence of alkaloid biosynthetic BAHDs and the duplication event 60-80 mya that gave rise to the blue and the red subclades &#x2014; potentiated the emergence of the ASAT activities. Presumably, acylsugars provided a fitness advantage to the ancestral plants, leading to the refinement of ASAT activities over the next few million years. For acylsugar production to emerge, these steps in enzyme evolution would have been accompanied by parallel innovations in ASAT transcriptional regulation leading to gland cell expression as well as production of precursors (i.e., acyl CoA donors and sucrose) in Type I/IV trichomes.</p>
<p>Since the origin of the Solanaceae, this pathway experienced another round of major innovation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) leading to the aASAT2 functional switch. We propose that this cycle of innovation was made possible by the potentiation provided by the similarity in activities of aASAT1,2 and 3, conducive to the emergence of promiscuity. Thus, the sucrose acylation activity may have already emerged in aASAT2 before the aASAT1 ortholog loss. It is unclear whether the loss of aASAT1 was a result of it being rendered redundant by the emergence of the aASAT2 promiscuous activity or an unrelated loss event. Regardless, this loss event was associated with the reorganization of acylsugar biosynthesis, and perhaps was followed by a refinement in the actualized aASAT2 sucrose acylation activity. Additional sampling of intermediate species can help test this model and determine the dynamics that played out between aASAT1,2,3 orthologs between 20-15 my. We cannot rule out the possibility of aASAT2 switching to ASAT1 after the aASAT1 ortholog loss. However, this model is less parsimonious, because it needs the emergence of the ASAT1 activity to occur &#x201C;just in time&#x201D; before the entire downstream pathway decayed or diversified through drift. In addition to this second cycle of innovation, previous results from closely related <italic>Solanum</italic> species also revealed more recent cycles involving gene duplication, regulatory divergence of ASATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schilmiller et al., 2015</xref>) and neo-functionalization of duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ning et al., 2015</xref>) in influencing the phenotypes produced by this pathway. These findings highlight the striking plasticity of the acylsugar biosynthetic network and illustrate the many ways by which chemical novelty emerges in specialized metabolism.</p>
<p>In this study, we used an integrative strategy combining high-throughput technologies and traditional biochemistry. <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> is the flagship species of the Solanaceae family, and we were able to apply the insights derived with this crop as a foundation to discover novel enzymes in related species. Our investigations in Salpiglossis were also aided by the availability of ASATs and NMR structures of their products in Petunia, which is more closely related to Salpiglossis than tomato. &#x201C;Anchor species&#x201D; such as Petunia, which are phylogenetically distant from flagship/model species, can enable study of a different region of the phylogenetic tree of the clade of interest. Development of limited genomic and functional resources in such anchor species, coupled with integrative, comparative approaches can offer more efficient routes for the exploration of biochemical complexity in the &#x223C;300,000 plant species estimated to exist on our planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mora et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterizing the SsASAT5 activity</title>
<p>Identification of SsASAT5 activity required a significant amount of the starting substrate, however, standard sequential reactions used to isolate SsASAT1,2,3 activities do not produce enough starting substrate for SsASAT5. Hence, we used S3:15(5,5,5) purified from a back-crossed inbred line (BIL6180, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ofner et al., 2016</xref>)) whose NMR resolved structure shows R2, R3, R4 positions acylated by C5 chains (unpublished data) &#x2014; same as Salpiglossis tri-acylsugars. SsASAT5 could use this substrate to acylate the furanose ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S6">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 6A,B</xref>), however, the tetra-acylsugar thus produced is not further acetylated to penta-acylsugar, suggesting the C2 acylation by SsASAT5 is not the same as the C2 acylation on tetra-acylsugars <italic>in vivo</italic>. SsASAT5 also acetylated the acceptors S4:21(5,5,5,6) and S4:19(2,5,6,6) purified from Salpiglossis trichome extracts on the furanose ring to penta-acylsugars that co-migrated with the most abundant penta-acylsugars purified from the plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Finally, S5:23(2,5,5,5,6) and S5:21(2,2,5,6,6) purified from plant extracts were enzymatically acetylated to hexa-acylsugars, which co-migrated with two low abundance hexa-acylsugars from the plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S6">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 6C,D</xref>).

Agroinfiltration of Salpiglossis plants was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vel&#x00E1;squez et al., 2009</xref>) using the prick inoculation method. Salpiglossis phytoene desaturase was used as the positive control for silencing. Empty pTRV2-LIC or pTRV2 vectors were used as negative controls. Each VIGS trial was done slightly differently while modifying the growth, transformation and maintenance conditions of this non-model species. The experimental details, including the optimal growth and VIGS conditions that give the fastest results, are noted in <bold>Figure 3-Table Supplement 1</bold>.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic inference</title>
<p>All steps in the phylogenetic reconstruction were carried out using MEGA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>). Amino acid sequences were aligned using Muscle with default parameters. Maximum likelihood and/or neighbor joining (NJ) were used to generate phylogenetic trees. For maximum likelihood, the best evolutionary model (JTT[Jones-Taylor-Thornton]&#x002B;G&#x002B;I with 5 rate categories) was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion after screening several models available in the MEGA6 software, while for NJ, the default JTT model was used. Support values were obtained using 1000 bootstrap replicates, however trees obtained using 100 bootstrap replicates also showed similar overall topologies. Trees were generated either using &#x201C;complete deletion&#x201D; or &#x201C;partial deletion with maximum 30&#x0025; gaps/missing data&#x201D; options for tree reconstruction. Sequences &#x003C;350aa (eg: Solyc10g079570) were excluded from this analysis.</p>

The inset shows positive mode data suggesting all four chains are on the same ring. Given R6 is the only free hydroxyl group available on the pyranose ring in S3:17(5,6,6), and since SsASAT1 and SsASAT2 acylate R2 and R4 positions, the only position SsASAT3 can acylate without inhibiting PaASAT4 is R3.

One possible explanation for this result is that another transcript was silenced in addition to SsASAT2. However, the single Salpiglossis transcript with 100&#x0025; identity to the silencing fragment over 18 nucleotides is not preferentially expressed in the trichomes of uninfected Salpiglossis (&#x223C;360 reads in trichome; &#x223C;550 reads in shaved stem) and is annotated as an ion channel.

<p>Total RNA was extracted from 4-5 week old (<italic>S. nigrum, S. quitoense</italic>) or 7-8 week old plants (<italic>H. niger,</italic> Salpiglossis) using Qiagen RNEasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) with on-column DNA digestion. In addition to trichome RNA, total RNA was extracted from shaved stems of <italic>S. nigrum</italic> and Salpiglossis, and shaved petioles of <italic>S. quitoense</italic> and <italic>H. niger</italic>. The quality of extracted RNA was determined using Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, California). Total RNA from all 16 samples (4 species x 2 tissues x 2 biological replicates) was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, USA) in two lanes (8X multiplexing per lane). Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library preparation kit LT, sequencing carried out using Rapid SBS Reagents in a 2x100bp paired end format, base calling done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.18.61 and the output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format by Illumina Bcl2fastq v1.8.4.</p>

<title>Confirmation of <italic>Salpiglossis sinuata</italic></title>
<p>We confirmed the plant to be Salpiglossis using the chloroplast <italic>ndhF</italic> and <italic>trnLF</italic> marker based phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1A,B</xref>). Specifically, we amplified these regions using locus-specific primers, sequenced the amplicons and assembled the contigs using Muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc3">Edgar, 2004</xref>). A neighbor joining tree including <italic>ndhF</italic> and <italic>trnLF</italic> sequences from NCBI Genbank was used to confirm the identity of the plant under investigation.</p>

<title>Prediction of protein sequences and orthologous group assignments</title>
<p>The protein sequences corresponding to the longest isoform of all expressed transcripts (read count&#x003E;10 in at least one dataset in a given species) were obtained using TransDecoder (Haas et al., 2013) and GeneWise v2.1.20c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">Birney et al., 2004</xref>). Only the protein sequences of transcripts with &#x2265;10 reads as defined by RSEM were used for constructing orthologous groups using OrthoMCL v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">Li et al., 2003</xref>). We defined orthologous relationships between <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, <italic>S. quitoense</italic>, <italic>H. niger</italic>, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, Salpiglossis and <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> (outgroup) using an inflation index of 1.5.</p>

<title>Gene Ontology enrichment analyses</title>
<p>We transferred the tomato gene ontology assignments to the homologs from other species in the same orthologous group. GO enrichment analysis was performed using a custom R script, and enriched categories were obtained using Fisher Exact Test and correction for multiple testing based on Q-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">Storey, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p>Primers to specific regions of the targeted transcript were designed with amplicons between 100- 200 bp using Primer3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc9">Untergasser et al., 2012</xref>). The regions selected for amplification did not overlap with the region targeted in the VIGS analysis. Primer sets for Salpiglossis orthologs of PDS and elongation factor alpha (EF1a) were used as controls. We used 1 &#x03BC;g of total RNA from a single VIGS plant with an acylsugar phenotype to generate cDNA using the Thermo Fisher Superscript II RT kit. An initial amplification and visualization on a 1&#x0025; agarose gel was performed to ensure that the primers yielded an amplicon with the predicted size and did not show visible levels of primer dimers. We first tested multiple primer sets per gene and selected primers within 85-115&#x0025; efficiency range using a dilution series of cDNA from uninoculated plants. These primers were used for the final qRT-PCR reaction. The Ct values for the transcripts (on 1x template) were measured in triplicate, which were averaged for the analysis. Both uninoculated and empty vector controls were measured with all primer sets for &#x0394;&#x0394;Ct calculations.</p>

<title>Similarity searches using BLAST</title>
<p>Similarity searches against the 1kp and NCBI nr databases were performed using TBLASTN, using SlASAT1, SlASAT3, SsASAT1 and SsASAT2 protein sequences as queries. For the 1kp database, TBLASTN was performed against all Asterid sequences, and the best non-Solanaceae sequences were analyzed using phylogenetic tree reconstruction (see below; Figure 6-Source Data 1). The BLAST at NCBI was performed against several specific groups of species, namely (i) orders Gentianales&#x002B;Boraginales&#x002B;Lamiales&#x002B;Solanales-(family Solanaceae), (ii) Only Convolvulaceae, (iii) Solanaceae-(sub-family Solanoideae), (iv) Solanoideae-(genera Solanum&#x002B;Capsicum), (v) Solanoideae-(genus Solanum), (vi) Solanum-(section Lycopersicon&#x002B;species tuberosum). The top 10 hits from each search were manually curated and analyzed in a phylogenetic context with SlASATs and SsASATs (Figure 6-Figure Supplement 2,3). We used a similar approach to search the annotated peptide sequences in <italic>C. canephora</italic> (Denoeud et al., 2014) and <italic>Ipomoea trifida</italic> (Hirakawa et al., 2015) sequence databases. Sequences that provided additional insights into the evolution of the ASAT clade were integrated into the final gene tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p>

<title>Estimating the number of acylsugars</title>
<p>This and previous studies provide evidence for a number of acyl chains esterified to sucrose, classified into short (C2, C3, C4, iC5, aiC5, iC6, aiC6, C8), long (nC10, iC10, nC11, nC12) and non-aliphatic (malonyl). We only focused on aliphatic chains for this estimate. We typically see one long chain and 3-4 short chains on the sugar molecule across different Solanaceae species. In our calculation, we assumed that each acyl chain has the same probability of being incorporated into the acylsugar, with the core being a sucrose core. Under these assumptions, there are 8 acyl chains that could be incorporated at three positions on a tetra-acylsugar and 12 acyl chains on the fourth position. This gives a theoretical estimate of 8&#x002A;8&#x002A;8&#x002A;12=6144 acylsucroses that could be produced with the above acyl chains.</p>
