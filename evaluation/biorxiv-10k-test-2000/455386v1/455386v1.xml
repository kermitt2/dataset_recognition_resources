<abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>In bone, sclerostin is mainly osteocyte-derived and plays an important local role in adaptive responses to mechanical loading. Sclerostin is also present at detectable concentrations within the circulation. Our genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 10,584 European-descent individuals identified two novel serum sclerostin loci, <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> (standard deviation (SD) change in sclerostin per A allele &#x03B2;=0.20, P=4.6x10<sup>-49</sup>), and <italic>GALNT1</italic> (&#x03B2;=0.11 per G allele, P=4.4x10<sup>-11</sup>), of which the former is a known locus for BMD estimated by heel ultrasound (eBMD). Common variants across the genome explained 16&#x0025; of the phenotypic variation of serum sclerostin. Mendelian randomization revealed an inverse causal relationship between serum sclerostin and femoral neck BMD and eBMD, and a positive relationship with fracture risk. Colocalization analysis demonstrated common genetic signals within the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> locus for higher sclerostin, lower BMD, and greater <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> expression in arterial tissue (Probability&#x003E;99&#x0025;). Renal and cortical bone tissue, and osteoblast cultures, were found to express high levels of B4GALNT3, an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase which adds a terminal LacdiNAc disaccharide to target glycocoproteins. Together, these findings raise the possibility that sclerostin is a substrate for B4GALNT3, such that its modification leads to higher levels, possibly through greater stability. <italic>GALNT1</italic>, an enzyme causing mucin-type O-linked glycosylation, may act in a similar capacity. We conclude that genetic variation in glycosylation enzymes represents a novel determinant of BMD and fracture risk, acting via alterations in levels of circulating sclerostin.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sclerostin is a glycoprotein produced by osteocytes, which is thought to play an important role in bone&#x2019;s adaptive response to mechanical loading, acting within the local bone microenvironment to suppress bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The sclerostin antibody romosozumab has recently been found to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), establishing sclerostin as an important drug target for osteoporosis. Sclerostin is also detectable in the systemic circulation, the functional role of which remains unclear. Serum sclerostin exchanges with the bone micro-environment, and may simply mirror the prevalent conditions within bone. Consistent with this suggestion, serum sclerostin has been found to respond to physiological stimuli such as estrogen in parallel to alterations in local bone expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies suggest that serum sclerostin exerts other roles outside the skeleton. For example, serum sclerostin has been reported to increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may contribute to the pathogenesis of Chronic Kidney Disease&#x2013;Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Serum sclerostin levels are also higher in patients with cardiovascular disease and may predict cardiovascular mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). A relationship with glucose metabolism has been suggested in light by reports of higher sclerostin levels in association with type I and type II diabetes mellitus in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) respectively. While these changes may represent &#x2018;off target&#x2019; effects of sclerostin originating from bone, alternatively, sclerostin might act as an endocrine hormone, subject to regulation by as yet unidentified additional factors. Adding to this complexity, several extra skeletal tissues have been found to express sclerostin, including the liver, chondrocytes, kidney and vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Aside from extra skeletal target tissues, perturbations in serum sclerostin could conceivably affect the bone itself through consequent alterations of sclerostin levels within the local bone environment.</p>
<p>In order to identify novel factors affecting bone metabolism and other systems through altered sclerostin levels, we performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of serum sclerostin. We then applied our results in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) to explore putative causal relationships between serum sclerostin and bone metabolism (as reflected by BMD).</p>

<sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Genome-wide association study meta-analysis of serum sclerostin</title>
<p>GWAS results were available in 10,584 participants across four cohorts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 show the Manhattan plot and QQ plot of association results from the fixed-effect meta-analysis of sclerostin in Europeans, respectively (see Supplementary Figure 3 for the QQ plots for each study). There was little evidence of inflation of the association results as the genomic inflation factors &#x03BB; is 1.051 and the LD score regression intercept is 1.015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Therefore, genomic control correction was not applied to any of the meta-analysis results. LD score regression revealed that all common variants we included in the meta-analysis explained 16.3&#x0025; of the phenotypic variance of sclerostin (H<sup>2</sup>=0.163, S.E.=0.052, P=0.0017)</p>

<p>Two loci were identified to be associated with serum sclerostin at a genome-wide level. 69 SNPs in the <italic>B4GLANT3</italic> gene region were associated with sclerostin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The top hit rs215226 at this locus (&#x03B2; = 0.205 SD change in serum sclerostin per A allele, SE = 0.014, P = 4.60 x 10<sup>-49</sup>, variance explained = 1.99&#x0025;) was previously reported to be associated with BMD estimated by heel ultrasound (eBMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The second locus was in the <italic>GALNT1</italic> gene region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with the top hit rs7241221 (&#x03B2; = 0.109 SD per G allele, SE = 0.017, P = 4.40 x 10<sup>-11</sup>, variance explained = 0.39&#x0025;). In addition, one SNP near the <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> region encoding OPG, rs1485303, was marginally associated with sclerostin (&#x03B2; = 0.074 SD per G allele, SE = 0.014, P = 7.70 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>, variance explained = 0.26&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The latter SNP is in moderate LD with a previously reported BMD associated SNP rs1353171 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.277 in the 1000 Genome Europeans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The association signals of the GWAS meta-analysis can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and Supplementary Table 1. Results of the random effects meta-analysis were identical to those of the fixed effects meta-analysis (results not shown). The degree of heterogeneity was low across studies for the <italic>GALNT1</italic> signal (I<sup>2</sup>=0) and <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> signal (I<sup>2</sup>=0.53) but relatively high for <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> signal (I<sup>2</sup>=0.78) (Supplementary Table 2). The latter appeared to reflect a relatively strong association in 4D, suggesting as possible interaction with the presence of CKD. Conditional analyses on the lead SNP in each association locus yielded no additional independent signals reaching genome-wide significance.</p>

<p>Only minor genetic influences on serum sclerostin were observed within the <italic>SOST</italic> gene (Chromosome 17, 41731099 to 41936156), which produces sclerostin. In total, four <italic>SOST</italic> SNPs have previously been reported in association with BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), and one with fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, proxy SNPs for these SNPs showed little or no association with serum sclerostin (Supplementary Table 3). We used the GWAS results to estimate the genetic correlation between sclerostin and 11 bone phenotypes using LD score regression via LD Hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We observed no strong evidence of genetic correlation between sclerostin SNPs and the bone phenotypes we tested. (Supplementary Table 4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis of sclerostin and bone phenotypes</title>
<p>Using two sample Mendelian Randomization (MR), we applied our GWAS results to larger datasets in order to examine putative causal relationship between sclerostin and bone phenotypes. The two SNPs robustly associated with sclerostin (rs215226 in <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> region and rs7241221 in <italic>GALNT1</italic> region) were used as genetic instruments of the exposure. DXA-derived BMD and eBMD results from the GEFOS consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) respectively, and fracture from UK Biobank, were used as outcomes. Contrasting with the genetic correlation results, based on inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis, we observed that higher level of serum sclerostin was causally related to lower femoral neck BMD (&#x03B2;= -0.123 SD change in BMD per SD increase in sclerostin, 95&#x0025;CI= -0.195 to -0.051, P=0.00074), lower eBMD (&#x03B2;= -0.122 SD change in BMD per SD increase in sclerostin, 95&#x0025;CI= -0.140 to -0.104, P= 1.29x10<sup>-38</sup>) and higher fracture risk (&#x03B2;=1.117 SD change in odds ratio (OR) per SD increase in sclerostin, 95&#x0025;CI= 1.009 to 1.237, P= 0.034) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There was also weak evidence of an inverse relationship between sclerostin level and lumbar spine BMD. The single SNP MR results suggested that both instruments contributed to the overall causal effects we observed (Supplementary Table 5). Heterogeneity analysis of the instruments suggested that causal estimates were consistent across both SNPs (P values of Cochran Q test &#x003E; 0.05), with the exception of estimates for lumbar spine BMD and fracture risk, likely reflecting the lower power in these instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Colocalization analysis between sclerostin and eBMD suggested that both instruments colocalized with eBMD independently (PP=99.7&#x0025; for the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> locus and 99.8&#x0025; for the <italic>GALNT1</italic> locus) (Supplementary Table 6), further strengthening the evidence of the putative causal relationship between sclerostin and eBMD.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="455386_fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>We also undertook bidirectional MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) to evaluate the possibility of reverse causality between femoral neck BMD (or lumbar spine BMD) and serum sclerostin level, based on SNPs identified in GEFOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We modelled femoral neck BMD and lumbar spine BMD as our exposure and serum sclerostin level as our outcome. The Steiger filtering analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) suggested that 28 of the 32 femoral neck BMD SNPs and all 27 lumbar spine BMD SNPs exerted their primary effect on BMD as opposed to sclerostin (Supplementary Table 7). IVW results using 28 femoral neck BMD SNPs suggested a positive relationship between femoral neck BMD and sclerostin (&#x03B2;=0.157 SD change in sclerostin per SD change in BMD, 95&#x0025;CI= 0.039 to 0.274, P=0.009) while IVW results using 27 lumbar spine BMD SNPs suggested a positive relationship between lumbar spine BMD and sclerostin (&#x03B2;=0.210 SD change in sclerostin per SD change in BMD, 95&#x0025;CI=0.084 to 0.335, P=0.001). Sensitivity analyses using MR Egger and Weighted Median methods showed similar albeit weaker causal effects (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B). There was no strong evidence of horizontal pleitropy for femoral neck BMD (Egger regression intercept = -0.0082, P = 0.406) or lumbar spine BMD (Egger regression intercept = -0.0082, P = 0.511). The heterogeneity test suggested no strong heterogeneity across instruments for femoral neck (Cochrane Q = 34.397, P = 0.155), but suggested some heterogeneric effects across instruments for lumbar spine BMD (Cochrane Q = 40.132, P = 0.038). We further detected one outlier SNP for lumbar spine BMD using Cochrane test implemented in &#x201C;RadialMR&#x201D; R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The radial plot can be found in Supplementary Figure 5. As a sensitivity analysis, we removed the outlier SNP and IVW results using the remaining 26 lumbar spine BMD SNPs still suggested a positive relationship between lumbar spine BMD and sclerostin (&#x03B2;=0.244, 95&#x0025;CI=0.123 to 0.365, P=8.02x10<sup>-5</sup>) (Supplementary Table 8).</p>

<sec id="s2c1"><title>Predicted regulatory elements of the top association signals</title>
<p>We identified DNA features and regulatory elements of SNPs in high LD with the top association signals (r<sup>2</sup>&#x003E;0.8), using Regulomedb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Among the 24 tested SNPs, we found three proxy SNPs showing high Regulomedb score (Supplementary Table 9): rs1872426 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.87 with the leading SNP rs1485303 in the <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> region) had a score of 1f (eQTL &#x002B; TF binding / DNase peak); rs215224 and rs4980826 (r<sup>2</sup>=1 and 0.85 with the leading SNP rs215226 respectively in the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> region) had a score of 2b (TF binding &#x002B; any motif &#x002B; DNase Footprint &#x002B; DNase peak) (see Supplementary Figure 6 for rs215224). We also intersected variants with ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) generated from the proximal and distal femur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). In the <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> locus, one SNP, rs2073618, overlapped with an ATAC-seq peak, while in the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> locus, four SNPs (rs12318530, rs215223, rs215224 and rs215225) fell in the same ATAC-Seq and Chip-Seq peak (Supplementary Figure 7 and Supplementary Table 10).</p>

<sec id="s2c2"><title>Expression QTLs lookups for sclerostin signals</title>
<p>To evaluate if the sclerostin association signals influence transcription of cis genes, we cross-referenced the sclerostin SNPs with <italic>cis</italic>-expression data in tissues measured in the GTEx consortium v7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), primary osteoblast cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and iliac crest bone biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The top association signal within the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> region, rs215226, showed a strong positive association with <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> gene expression in arterial and ovarian tissue (Supplementary Table 11). In contrast, a weaker inverse association with <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> expression was observed in nervous tissue. Colocalization analysis yielded strong evidence that sclerostin levels share the same causal variant at this locus with arterial and ovarian <italic>B4GLANT3</italic> expression (probability &#x003E; 99&#x0025;), whereas there was no evidence of co-localisation in the case of nervous tissue (Supplementary Table 12). The association signal in the <italic>GALNT1</italic> region was positively associated with <italic>GALNT1</italic> expression in adipose tissue, and that of the neighbouring gene, <italic>INO80C</italic>, in adipose and heart tissue. In contrast, sclerostin association signals in <italic>B4GALNT3</italic>, <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> and <italic>GALNT1</italic> were not associated with <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of mRNA expression in osteoblast cells (Supplementary Table 13) or iliac crest bone biopsies (Supplementary Table 14). In <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL analyses, the <italic>GALNT1</italic> signal was related to lower <italic>SOST</italic> mRNA levels in iliac crest bone biopsies, particularly in Affymetrix chip analyses, whereas no association was observed for <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> or <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> (Supplementary Table 15).</p>

<sec id="s2c3"><title>Methylation QTLs lookups for sclerostin signals</title>
<p>To evaluate if our top association signals have the potential to influence DNA methylation, we cross-referenced the sclerostin SNPs with <italic>cis</italic>-methylation data from blood cells obtained at five different time points (ALSPAC children at Birth, Childhood and Adolescence; ALSPAC mothers during Pregnancy and at Middle age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)).

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Having performed a GWAS meta-analysis of serum sclerostin, we identified two genomewide significant loci (<italic>B4GALNT3</italic> and <italic>GALNT1</italic>), and a further locus close to genome wide significance (<italic>TNFRSF11B</italic>). Together, common HapMap3 variants explained 16&#x0025; of the variance of serum sclerostin. By using rs215226 in <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> and rs7241221 in <italic>GALNT1</italic> to examine causal relationships between serum sclerostin and BMD, we found evidence of an inverse relationship between sclerostin and BMD, and a positive relationship with fracture risk, in line with randomized control trial findings that the sclerostin inhibitor romosozumab increases BMD and reduces fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Moreover, association signals with sclerostin at these two loci colocalized with those for eBMD, consistent with the possibility that genetic variation in <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> and <italic>GALNT1</italic> alters BMD via changes in serum sclerostin. Although our analyses were primarily intended to identify loci associated with serum sclerostin, there is some evidence to suggest that rs215224 was responsible for the underlying genetic signal at the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> locus. This SNP is in perfect LD with our top <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> hit, rs215226. Rs215224 shows strong evidence of alteration of transcriptional activity from RegulomeDB, supported by the finding that this SNP falls within an ATAC-seq site of E15.5 mouse femurs. That said, though rs215224was also associated with differential methylation at two distinct CPG sites within <italic>B4GALNT3</italic>, one of which coincided with an ATAC-seq site, these were at distinct locations within the gene.</p>
<p>The <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> locus that we observed to be strongly related to serum sclerostin expresses a Golgi enzyme, beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase, which transfers a GalNac residue to a nonreducing terminal GlcNAc-&#x03B2;, producing the disaccharide structure LacdiNAc. <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> has previously been reported to be expressed in multiple human tissues, including arterial, gastrointestinal tract and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In the present study, in mice, <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> mRNA was expressed at highest levels in kidney and cortical bone. This finding is consistent with high levels of <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> mRNA expression in renal tissue from human fetal samples in the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/</ext-link>, data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/data/">http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/data/</ext-link>). The <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> locus we identified showed strong <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity in eQTL studies in arterial tissue, which was confirmed by the colocalization analysis. The effect allele associated with higher sclerostin levels was associated with considerably greater <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> mRNA levels in arterial tissue, suggesting that B4GALNT3 acts to increase sclerostin levels.</p>
<p>Sclerostin is a glycoprotein which, like <italic>B4GALNT3</italic>, is also expressed at a number of sites outside the skeleton including arterial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Whereas sclerostin protein is detected in multiple tissues, extra-skeletal sclerostin mRNA is mainly expressed in the kidney, reflecting renal tubular expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>), suggesting this may be the predominant extra-skeletal source of circulating sclerostin. It&#x2019;s tempting to speculate that sclerostin acts as a substrate for <italic>B4GALNT3</italic>, such that formation of a terminal LacdiNAc moiety protects sclerostin from degradation and clearance from the circulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This interpretation is analogous to the role of <italic>GALNT3</italic>, a Golgi enzyme which acts to Oglycosylate another osteocyte-derived protein, FGF23, protecting it from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Given our finding that B4GALNT3 is expressed at high levels in the kidney, a major source of extra-skeletal sclerostin, the kidney may represent the principle source of glycosylated sclerostin. To the extent that activity of renal sclerostin glycosylation influences BMD via changes in circulating sclerostin levels, rather than the latter simply reflecting &#x2018;spill over&#x2019; from sclerostin within the bone micro environment, a two-way exchange may exist whereby perturbations in circulating sclerostin levels alter concentrations within bone. The <italic>GALNT1</italic> locus, which was also associated with serum sclerostin, expresses an enzyme that initiates Oglycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), and may act similarly to alter sclerostin levels by reducing sclerostin clearance.</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 4</label>
<caption><p>Proposed exchange of sclerostin between skeletal and systemic compartments. Sclerostin, synthesized by osteocytes, is present within the bone micro-environment, but also exchanges with the systemic circulation, where it is produced by several extra-skeletal tissues including the kidney. Whereas locally produced sclerostin is largely responsible for actions of sclerostin on bone, factors which influence circulating levels may also play a role, including variation in activity of B4GALNT3, which we propose protects sclerostin from degradation through generation of a terminal LacdiNAc.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="455386_fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>In addition, we found that <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> is expressed at relatively high levels in bone, particularly cortical bone, where sclerostin is also preferentially expressed, reflecting its production by osteocytes. Specifically, <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> mRNA expression was detected in osteoblast cultures derived from mouse calvariae, but not in bone marrow macrophage cultures induced to form osteoclasts. Further studies are required to establish whether B4GALNT3 is expressed in osteocytes as well as osteoblasts. However, to the extent that B4GALNT3 and sclerostin expression overlap within bone, theoretically, B4GALNT3-dependent glycosylation might influence local sclerostin activity in a variety of ways, including altered production. Although genetic variation in <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> might conceivably influence circulating sclerostin via a primary action in bone, against this suggestion, there was little evidence of <italic>B4GALNT3 cis</italic>-regulatory activity in osteoblasts and bone tissue. Furthermore, the <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> SNP did not appear to act as a trans-eQTL signal for <italic>SOST</italic> in bone. However, eQTL studies in bone had considerably less power than those in other tissues analysed (285 and 78 individuals for tibial artery and bone biopsy studies respectively).</p>
<p>Genetic variation within the <italic>SOST</italic> gene appeared to have relatively weak associations with serum sclerostin, including <italic>SOST</italic> SNPs previously reported to be associated with BMD or hip fracture. This suggests that previously identified <italic>SOST</italic> SNPs influence BMD and hip fracture by altering local sclerostin activity in bone, independently of circulating sclerostin levels. That said, further studies with a larger sample size are needed to establish the contribution of genetic variation within the <italic>SOST</italic> locus to serum sclerostin. In terms of other genetic influences on serum sclerostin, the association between <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> and serum sclerostin was just below our threshold. The latter contains a well-established BMD locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and the protein product, OPG, plays a major role in regulating bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). However, against the suggestion that altered OPG production mediates this genetic association, eQTL studies in heart tissue revealed that rs1485303 (the most strongly associated SNP at this locus) is strongly associated with expression of the adjacent gene, <italic>COLEC10</italic>.</p>
<p>Whereas MR analyses using <italic>B4GLANT3</italic> and <italic>GALNT1</italic> as genetic instruments supported a causal influence of higher sclerostin levels in reducing BMD, bidirectional MR analysis suggested that if anything, higher BMD leads to greater sclerostin levels. This apparent positive influence of BMD on sclerostin levels is in line with previous reports of elevated sclerostin levels in individuals with extreme elevations in BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and of positive associations between serum sclerostin levels and lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). One explanation for this latter relationship is that individuals with higher BMD have a relatively large amount of bone tissue, and therefore, produce more sclerostin as result of having greater numbers of osteocytes. Additionally, these causal relationships may represent components of a regulatory feedback pathway, such that greater bone formation leading to increased BMD stimulates sclerostin production, which then feed backs to reduce bone formation and hence limit BMD gains.</p>
<sec id="s3a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
<p>This study represents the first GWAS of serum sclerostin. We identified two loci, and one further suggestive locus, which were previously unknown to be related to serum sclerostin, including <italic>B4GALNT3,</italic> encoding a galactosaminyl transferase, which had a relatively strong association for a common variant (i.e. 0.2SD change in serum sclerostin per allele). In terms of weaknesses, the total study sample of around 11,000 was relatively small. In addition, different methods were used to measure sclerostin in the participating cohorts; as well as different ELISAs, the MANOLIS cohort used the OLINK proteomics platform. Nonetheless, similar genetic associations were observed across all four cohorts, suggesting different sclerostin measurement methods are unlikely to have importantly impacted on our results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Having performed a GWAS meta-analysis for serum sclerostin, we identified two genome wide significant loci encoding glycosylation enzymes, namely <italic>B4GALNT3</italic> and <italic>GALNT1</italic>. Genetic association signals for sclerostin at both loci co-localised with BMD, raising the possibility that variation in sclerostin glycosylation represents a hitherto unrecognised determinant of osteoporosis risk. Given the interest in sclerostin as a target for new osteoporosis treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and as a genetic basis for skeletal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), understanding the contribution of glycosylation to sclerostin activity may yield new opportunities for medical application.</p>

According to the manufacture&#x2019;s protocol, the standard range for the array kit was 0 &#x2013; 240 pmol/l and the lower detection limit was 3.2 pmol/l. Each kit was run with an internal quality control. All samples were run in duplicate and if the sclerostin measurement differed more than 20&#x0025; between the duplicates, we removed the individual from further analysis. Outliers four SDs away from the mean value were excluded. After these exclusions, 8772 individuals with linked genetic and demographic data were available for analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Variant calling was performed using the GATK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) best practices and association was performed using GEMMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), using an empirical relatedness matrix calculated on a LD-pruned set of common variants (MAF&#x003E;5&#x0025;) filtered for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium p&#x003C;1x10-5. At the association stage, variants were not filtered for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Full details of the sequencing, variant calling and association protocol have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). After sequencing and phenotype QC, 1,316 samples had both genotype and phenotype data available in the MANOLIS cohort.</p>

<sec id="s4e"><title>GWAS Meta-analysis of sclerostin</title>
<p>Sclerostin measures in the four cohorts were standardized to SD units. Each cohort ran a GWAS across all imputed or sequenced variants. Age, sex and the first 10 principal components (PCs) were included as covariates in all models. Linear mixed models BOLTLMM and GEMMA were applied to ALSPAC and MONOLIS cohort, respectively, to adjust for cryptic population structure and relatedness. We standardized the genomic coordinates to be reported on the NCBI build 37 (hg19), and alleles on the forward strand. Summary level quality control was conducted for Europeans only in EasyQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Meta-analysis (using a fixed-effects model implemented in EasyQC) was restricted to variants common to all four studies (n=5,245,208 variants), MAF &#x003E;1&#x0025;, and high imputation quality score (Rsq &#x003E;0.8 for variants imputed in MACH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) and info &#x003E;0.8 for variants imputed in IMPUTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>)). P &#x003C; 5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> in the meta-analysis was used to define genome-wide significant associations. Each locus is represented in the corresponding results table by the variant with the strongest evidence for association. A random effects model meta-analysis was also conducted using GWAMA version 2.2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and Cochrane&#x0027;s Q test.</p>
<sec id="s4e1"><title>Conditional analysis</title>
<p>To detect multiple independent association signals at each of the genome-wide significant sclerostin loci, we carried out an approximate conditional and joint genome-wide association analysis using the software package GCTA-COJO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). SNPs with high collinearity (Correlation R2 &#x003E; 0.9) were ignored, and those situated more than 10 Mb away were assumed to be in complete linkage equilibrium. A reference sample of 8890 unrelated individuals of from ALSPAC mothers was used to model patterns of LD between variants. The reference genotyping data set consisted of the same 5 million variants assessed in our GWAS. Conditionally independent variants that reached GWAS significance were annotated to the physically closest gene with the Hg19 Gene range list available in dbSNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="s4e2"><title>Estimation of SNP heritability using Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression</title>
<p>To estimate the amount of genomic inflation in the data due to residual population stratification, cryptic relatedness and other latent sources of bias, we used LD score regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). LD scores were calculated for all high-quality SNPs (i.e., INFO score &#x003E; 0.9 and MAF &#x003E; 0.1&#x0025;) from the meta-analysis data set consisting of 10,584 individuals from the 4 cohorts. We further quantified the overall SNP-based heritability&#x2019;s with LD score regression using a subset of 1.2 million HapMap SNPs.</p>

<sec id="s5"><title>Genetic analysis between sclerostin and bone phenotypes</title>
<sec id="s5a"><title>Estimation of genetic correlations using LD Hub</title>
<p>To estimate the genetic correlation between sclerostin and bone phenotypes related to osteoporosis, we used a recent method based on LD score regression as implemented in the online web utility LD Hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This method uses the cross-products of summary test statistics from two GWASs and regresses them against a measure of how much variation each SNP tags (its LD score). Variants with high LD scores are more likely to contain more true signals and thus provide a greater chance of overlap with genuine signals between GWASs. The LD score regression method uses summary statistics from the GWAS meta-analysis of sclerostin and the bone phenotypes, calculates the cross-product of test statistics at each SNP, and then regresses the cross-product on the LD score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b"><title>Mendelian randomization of sclerostin on bone phenotypes</title>
<p>We undertook two sample MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) to evaluate evidence of a causal relationship between sclerostin measured in plasma and bone phenotypes. In this initial analysis, sclerostin was treated as the exposure and bone traits as the outcomes, using sclerostin associated SNPs as the instrumental variables. The multiple testing p-value threshold was calculated as p = 0.05 divided by the derived number of independent tests. We used the random effect inverse variance weighted (IVW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) and Wald ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) methods to obtain MR effect estimates. Heterogeneity analysis of the instruments were conducted using Cochran Q test. Results were plotted as forest plots using code derived from the ggplot2 package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). All MR analysis were conducted using the MR-Base TwoSampleMR R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR">github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5c"><title>Genetic colocalization analysis between sclerostin and bone phenotypes</title>
<p>We used a stringent Bayesian model (coloc) to estimate the posterior probability (PP) of each genomic locus containing a single variant affecting both serum sclerostin level and bone phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). A lack of evidence (i.e. PP &#x003C; 80&#x0025;) in this analysis would suggest that one of the causal variants for protein is simply in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the putative causal variant for the trait (thus introducing genomic confounding into the association between sclerostin level and bone phenotypes). We treated colocalised findings (PP&#x003E;=80&#x0025;) as &#x201C;Colocalised&#x201D;, and other findings that did not pass colocalization as &#x201C;Not colocalised&#x201D;.</p>

<sec id="s5d"><title>Bidirectional MR</title>
<p>To investigate the possibility that BMD causally affects levels of serum sclerostin, we used summary results data from 49 conditionally independent autosomal variants reported in a femoral neck BMD GWAS using 32,744 GEFOS individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We looked up these variants in summary results GWAS data on sclerostin from our meta-analysis and found 32 instruments for femoral neck BMD and 27 instruments for lumbar spine BMD. When applying bidirectional MR, we assume that SNPs used to proxy BMD exert their primary association on BMD, and that any correlation with sclerostin levels is a consequence of a causal effect of BMD on sclerostin. However, if in reality sclerostin levels exert a causal effect on BMD, then it is possible that some sclerostin SNPs might also reach genome-wide significance in a large GWAS of BMD. These sclerostin SNPs could then mistakenly be used as instruments for BMD, when in fact they should be used as instruments for sclerostin levels. This was the case in the GEFOS and UKBB studies as some of the BMD associated SNPs were also strongly associated with sclerostin (i.e. at genome-wide levels of significance). We therefore applied MR Steiger filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) as implemented in the TwoSampleMR R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) to test the causal direction of each BMD associated SNP on the hypothesized exposures (BMD) and outcome (sclerostin). We removed those sclerostin SNPs and performed inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR to identify the causal estimates of femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD on sclerostin. We further performed weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods that are more robust to the presence of genetic pleiotropy (which means BMD associated SNPs may influence sclerostin via additional pleiotropic paths that do not pass through BMD levels). We then performed pleitropy test using MR Egger intercept and heterogeneity test using Cochrane Q test. To identify outlier instruments of the exposures (FN-BMD and LS-BMD), we applied RadialMR R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) to estimate the individual contribution of each instruments to overall heterogeneity (in another word, the Cochrane Q of each SNP with 1 degree of freedom) and used the corresponding Cochrane p-value to detect outliers (P&#x003C;0.05). As a sensitivity analysis, we removed outliers and conducted the bidirectional MR again. All bidirectional MR were conducted using the TwoSampleMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) package.</p>

<sec id="s6a"><title>Predicted regulatory elements of the top association signals</title>
<p>For each locus associated with sclerostin, we identified all SNPs with high linkage disequilibrium (LD) from the top signal (LD r<sup>2</sup>&#x003E;0.8) and identify their DNA features and regulatory elements in non-coding regions of the human genome using Regulomedb v1.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.regulomedb.org/">http://www.regulomedb.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s6b"><title>ATAC-seq lookup in the top association regions</title>
<p>The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATACseq) is a method for mapping chromatin accessibility genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We intersected the sclerostin associated SNPs (or proxy SNPs with LD r<sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.8) with ATAC-seq data generated from the proximal and distal femur of an E15.5 mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) lifted over to the orthologous positions in human genome build hg19).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6c"><title>Gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) lookups for sclerostin signals</title>
<p>We investigated whether the SNPs influencing serum sclerostin level were driven by cisacting effects on transcription by evaluating the overlap between the sclerostin associated SNPs and eQTLs within 500kb of the gene identified, using data derived from all tissue types from the GTEx consortium v7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Evidence of eQTL association was defined as P &#x003C; 1x10<sup>-4</sup> and evidence of overlap of signal was defined as high LD (r2 0.8) between eQTL and sclerostin associated SNPs in the region. Where eQTLs overlapped with sclerostin associated SNPs, we used the colocalization analysis to estimate the posterior probability (PP) of each genomic locus containing a single variant affecting both serum sclerostin level and gene expression level in different tissues. Equivalent analyses were performed in human primary osteoblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), and cells derived from iliac crest bone from 78 postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In the latter, mRNA was quantified both by Affymetrix RNA chip and RNA-seq. RNASeq analyses were evaluating using a pipeline previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and publicly available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/eQTL-mapping-analysis-cookbook-for-RNA-seq-data">https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/eQTL-mapping-analysis-cookbook-for-RNA-seq-data</ext-link>). Briefly, gene expression data was TMM (trimmed mean of M values), normalized [18] and log2-transformed. Then, expression of each gene was centred and scaled. To reduce the effect of non-genetic sources of variability, we applied principal component analysis on the sample correlation matrix and the first five components were used as covariates. cis-eQTL analysis was performed on transcript-SNP combinations for which the distance from the centre of the transcript to the genomic location of the SNP was &#x2264;250 kb, whereas eQTLs with a distance greater than 5 Mb were defined as trans-eQTLs. Associations were tested by non-parametric Spearman&#x0027;s rank correlation and a threshold of false discovery rate (FDR&#x003C;0.05) applied. Analyses were adjusted for age, BMI and four genomic principle components.</p>

<sec id="s6d"><title>Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) lookups for sclerostin signals</title>
<p>We also investigated whether the SNPs influencing serum sclerostin level were mediated by cis-acting effects on DNA methylation by evaluating the overlap between the sclerostin associated SNPs and mQTLs within 500kb of the gene identified, using data measured in blood cells. We queried data from mQTLdb, which contained mQTL information at 5 different time points, ALSPAC children at Birth, Childhood and Adolescence and ALSPAC mothers during Pregnancy and at Middle age. This data is from the ARIES resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Evidence of mQTL association was defined as P &#x003C; 1x10<sup>-4</sup> and evidence of overlap of signal was defined as high LD (r2 0.8) between mQTL and sclerostin associated SNPs in the region.</p>

Primary calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from 3-5 days old C57Bl/6 mice by sequential digestion as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) Cells were cultured in complete &#x03B1;- MEM medium (MEM alpha medium (Gibco, 22561-021)) supplemented with 10&#x0025; heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma, F7524), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050-038), 50 &#x03BC;g/ml gentamicin (Gibco, 15750-037), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x03BC;g/ml streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-148) for 4-6 days before subculture in 48-well plates at 40,000 cells cm<sup>-2</sup> and induction of osteogenic differentiation in complete &#x03B1;-MEM supplemented with 10 mM &#x03B2;-glycerophosphate disodium salt hydrate (BGP; Sigma, G9422) and 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (Asc-2P; Sigma, A8960) for 2, 4 and 7 days. Bone marrow macrophages were isolated and amplified by culturing bone marrow cells from 8-12 weeks old C57Bl/6 in suspension culture discs (Corning Costar Ins., NY) in complete &#x03B1;-MEM with 30 ng/ml M-CSF (R&#x0026;D, 416-ML-050) for two days. Thereafter, the adherent macrophages were detached, and spot seeded in 24-well plates (40,000 cells/well). Macrophages were cultured for additional 3 days in complete &#x03B1;-MEM with 30 ng/ml M-CSF before gene expression analysis. For osteoclast generation, macrophages were cultured in 30 ng/ml MCSF and 4 ng/ml RANKL (R&#x0026;D, 462-TEC) for 3 days. RNA was isolated from cell cultures after cell lysis in RLT buffer using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen), and gene expression was analysed as above. Cell culture experiments were performed in quadruplicates and repeated twice with similar results.</p>
