<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>The ongoing activity of the left and right cortical hemispheres shows strong bilateral fluctuations. Here we show that these fluctuations are largely responsible for the variability observed in cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Using widefield imaging of voltage and calcium signals, we measured activity in the cortex of mice performing a visual detection task. Bilateral fluctuations invested all areas, particularly those closest to the midline. Activity was less bilateral in the monocular region of primary visual cortex and, especially during task engagement, in secondary motor cortex. Ongoing bilateral fluctuations dominated unilateral visual responses, and interacted additively with them, explaining much of the variance in trial-by-trial activity. Even though these fluctuations occurred in regions necessary for the task, they did not impact detection behavior. We conclude that bilateral ongoing activity continues during sensory stimulation and has a powerful additive impact on sensory processing.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Even in the absence of overt behavior, the patterns of ongoing activity exhibited by the awake cerebral cortex can display a striking degree of bilateral symmetry. When one region of cortex becomes active, this activity is often accompanied by activity in the symmetrical region in the opposite hemisphere. This bilateral symmetry has been documented both in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>) and in awake humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>). The degree of symmetry varies across cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>), but the rules behind the differences across areas remain unknown.</p>
<p>Bilateral ongoing activity coexists with event-related activity, which is not necessarily bilateral. For instance, when human subjects move their right hand, the movement-related BOLD response in left motor cortex coexists with bilateral ongoing fluctuations in both left and right motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fox et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not clear, however, to what extent this bilateral ongoing activity can influence sensory-evoked activity. Similar to the activity associated with movements, the activity evoked by visual stimuli in cortex is not generally bilateral. For instance, a visual stimulus presented to the side of the animal would evoke unilateral responses in the contralateral visual cortex. It is not known whether the bilateral ongoing activity coexists with the visually-evoked activity, or whether it is quenched by the onset of visual responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>If bilateral ongoing activity persists during sensory responses, it could contribute to the large trial-by-trial variability seen in these responses. Even in response to an identical visual stimulus, neural responses in primary visual cortex are well-known to vary strongly from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tolhurst et al., 1983</xref>). This variability has been observed not only in the spike trains but also in intracellular recordings from single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carandini, 2004</xref>) and in voltage imaging of neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>). How much of this trial-by-trial variability is explained by bilateral ongoing activity?</p>
<p>If much of trial by trial variability is explained by bilateral ongoing activity, then bilateral measurements may become necessary to estimate true sensory responses. How would such a procedure compare to the standard method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>) of measuring activity before a stimulus and removing it from the subsequent activity? Moreover, it is not known how bilateral ongoing activity interacts with visual responses, e.g. whether the interaction can be described as simply additive or multiplicative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Scholvinck et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, it is not known whether the bilateral fluctuations impair stimulus coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore impact perception.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we performed widefield optical imaging from both cortical hemispheres of mice performing a visual detection task. Widefield imaging allowed us to monitor bilateral ongoing activity and visually-evoked response across hemispheres. To observe these forms of activity both in membrane potential and in spiking activity, we measured both from mice expressing a voltage sensor and from mice expressing a calcium sensor. These measurements revealed that bilateral ongoing activity has a prominent impact on visually-evoked responses. An additive model for the interaction of ongoing and evoked activities provided excellent fits to the data, explaining up to 60&#x0025; of trial-by-trial variance in the observed imaging signal. On the other hand, bilateral ongoing activity did not seem to affect perceptual decisions, suggesting that it does not impact stimulus coding.</p>

<sec id="s2"><title>Results</title>
<p>We performed widefield imaging in the cerebral cortex of transgenic mice expressing voltage indicator VSFPB1.2 or calcium indicator GCaMP6 in excitatory neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The imaging window covered the dorsal part of both cortical hemispheres. We defined the location of sensory and motor areas by aligning the images to the Common Coordinate Framework of the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed the outlines of the visual areas based on functional mapping (visual field sign, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then measured activity while the mice performed a visual two-alternative task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). In the task, mice reported the location of a grating stimulus presented on the left or right visual field. Before the stimulus application, the mice were required to hold the wheel still for at least 500 ms. We begin by examining the ongoing activity measured in this pre-stimulus interval, focusing on trials when mice held the wheel without making eye movements.</p>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Ongoing cortical activity is largely bilateral</title>
<p>During the pre-stimulus interval we observed strong bilateral voltage activity over the entire dorsal cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>-D). This activity involved multiple cortical areas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and as reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shimaoka et al., 2017</xref>), it was largely symmetric between the left and right hemispheres. Indeed, this symmetric, bilateral activity accounted for most of the power of the measured voltage signals, and seemed to do so at all measured frequencies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>): we did not observe significant difference in coherence across frequencies (2-7Hz, p &#x003E; 0.05, one-way ANOVA).</p>
<p>These phenomena were not limited to voltage fluctuations, which might in principle be entirely subthreshold: they were also seen in calcium signals, which reflect neuronal spiking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). Calcium activity during the pre-stimulus interval involved multiple cortical areas, and was also typically symmetric between the hemispheres (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Just as with voltage signals, bilateral calcium activity accounted for most of the power of the measured calcium signals, and seemed to do so at all measured frequencies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Bilateral ongoing fluctuations differ across areas</title>
<p>The bilateral symmetry of ongoing activity, however, was not equal for all cortical areas, and tended to decrease with distance from the midline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). For each cortical area of interest, we computed the temporal correlation of that area (&#x2018;seed area&#x2019;) against all the other pixels. Both in mice expressing voltage indicators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and in mice expressing calcium indicators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), the resulting seed-area maps showed high correlation in the corresponding region in the opposite hemisphere. This bilateral correlation was particularly strong in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and in medial visual areas such as PM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D). Bilateral correlation tended to decrease with a region&#x2019;s distance from the midline, both in mice expressing voltage indicators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, pairwise correlation &#x03C1; &#x003D; &#x2212;0.44) and in mice expressing calcium indicators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, pairwise correlation &#x03C1; &#x003D; &#x2212;0.42).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="476333_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>However, correlation was lower than expected in the monocular region of primary visual cortex, V1m and, when the animal was engaged in the task, in secondary motor cortex (M2, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In area M2, this low bilateral correlation may be related to task engagement, because bilateral correlation seemed to be higher when the animal was in a passive condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, white circle). Indeed, the reduction in bilateral fluctuations seen with task engagement was specific to area M2, where it was significant (Supplementary Figure 1). For each cortical area we compared bilateral correlation in the active task vs. the passive condition using VSFP and GCaMP data. For all areas except M2 there was no significant change in correlations across the two conditions. This included V1m, where correlations were lower than in other areas but not significantly different across the two conditions (p &#x003E; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n &#x003D; 6 mice, Supplementary Figure 1D). In M2, instead, there was a significant reduction during the active task (p&#x003D;0.0013/0.013 before/after Bonferroni correction, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n &#x003D; 6 mice, Supplementary Figure 1H).</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Bilateral ongoing fluctuations continue during unilateral visual responses</title>
<p>Bilateral ongoing fluctuations continued following the onset of the visual stimulus, and were typically larger than the unilateral visual responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). For example, consider the voltage responses to three presentations of a 50&#x0025; contrast stimulus in the right monocular visual field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In all these trials, activity before visual stimulation was largely bilateral and continued to fluctuate after stimulus onset. Only by acquiring a large number of trials could these ongoing fluctuations be averaged out to reveal the underlying unilateral visually-driven activity (258 trials, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar results were obtained with calcium imaging. The bilateral activity seemed to continue unperturbed following presentation of a stimulus in the left monocular visual field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Averaging the calcium activity over 104 trials revealed localized visual responses in area V1 and higher visual areas, which grew between 50 and 150 ms after stimulus onset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Confirming these observations, we measured the activity evoked by our stimuli in areas V1 and PM, and observed that in the first 150 ms following stimulus presentation this activity was exclusively unilateral (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Task stimuli elicited visual activity solely in contralateral cortex, both in area V1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>red traces</italic>) and in area PM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>red traces</italic>). The mean activity rose in the period 50-150 ms after stimulus onset, and increased with contrast as expected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E,F</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Consistent with known variability of neural activity, this increase in mean was accompanied by an increase in standard deviation across trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D</xref>). By contrast, in the unstimulated hemisphere, the stimuli affected neither the mean activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <italic>black traces</italic>) nor the standard deviation of activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, D, <italic>black traces</italic>). These results suggest that bilateral fluctuations are not reduced by the onset of visual stimuli.</p>

<sec id="s2d"><title>Bilateral fluctuations and visually-evoked responses add linearly</title>
<p>We exploited the unilateral nature of visual responses to study their interaction with bilateral fluctuations. We illustrate these analyses with calcium imaging, where we have larger numbers of animals.</p>
<p>Inspection of trial-by-trial calcium signals suggested an additive interaction of stimulus-evoked responses and bilateral ongoing activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Consider, for instance, the trial-by-trial fluorescence measured in left and right area PM following the onset of a 100&#x0025; contrast stimulus on the left (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Activities were highly variable across trials both in the left, unstimulated hemisphere and in the right, stimulated hemisphere (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This variability persisted at the time of the visually-evoked response, 50-150 ms after stimulus onset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and showed strong bilateral correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>dots</italic>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="476333_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To quantify the relationship between left and right PM in the response period we computed a sliding average of right PM activity as a function of left PM activity, separately for 100&#x0025; contrast visual stimulus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> <italic>black curve</italic>), and 0&#x0025; contrast stimulus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> <italic>gray curve</italic>). Consistent with an additive interaction, the effect of the stimulus was to elevate this right-hemisphere activity by a constant amount, irrespective of left-hemisphere activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>black</italic> vs. <italic>gray curves</italic>).</p>
<p>To test whether the interaction between ongoing activity and visually evoked responses is additive, we examined the effects of variations in each factor&#x2019;s amplitude: the contrast of the stimulus, and the simultaneous amplitude of the bilateral fluctuation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>-H). We divided trials into two groups according to fluorescence at the time of the responses (50-150 ms) in the unstimulated hemisphere (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>blue</italic> vs. <italic>cyan</italic>). For all stimulus contrasts, the visual responses obtained when ongoing activity was high (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,D</xref>, <italic>cyan</italic>) appeared additively shifted compared to those obtained when ongoing activity was low (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,D</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>). To quantify this effect, we fitted the contrast responses with a curve with two free parameters: offset and scale. The offset parameter was significantly higher when ongoing activity was high (p &#x003D; 0.0009, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n &#x003D; 7 mice <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The scale parameter was much less affected: it appeared to show a mild increase when bilateral activity was high, but this increase was not significant (p &#x003E; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n &#x003D; 7 mice <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This result held not only for PM but also for all other visual areas: bilateral ongoing activity changed offset but not scale (n &#x003D; 7 in V1, n &#x003D; 5 mice in AL, LM and RL, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G,H</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e"><title>Bilateral fluctuations are rapid and their effect is independent of arousal</title>
<p>These effects of bilateral ongoing activity were due to fast changes in cortical activation, not to slow changes in cortical state (Supplementary Figure 2). Slow state changes might in principle have been able to explain these results; for instance, there may be more opportunities for bilateral ongoing activity to be &#x201C;high&#x201D; when the cortex is in a more synchronized state, and this state might be the fundamental factor that leads to elevated visual responses. To assess slow changes in cortical state, we computed the amplitude of 2-7 Hz fluctuations in bilateral activity before the stimulus, and thus divided trials in four groups, for all combinations of state (more desynchronized vs. more synchronized) and instantaneous activity (low vs. high, Supplementary Figure 2A). The interaction between instantaneous ongoing activity and visually-evoked responses was seen in synchronized and desynchronized states (Supplementary Figure 2B,C). The offset associated with high bilateral activity seemed to be larger in the synchronized state (Supplementary Figure 2C). However, this larger offset was explained by the fact that in the synchronized state, the bilateral ongoing activity tended to reach higher levels (Supplementary Figure 2A,D). Similar results were seen across the other mice (Supplementary Figure 2E-G): fast fluctuations, rather than cortical state, determine the size of the additive interaction on visually-evoked responses.</p>
<p>Similarly, the effects of bilateral ongoing activity were not related to slow changes in level of arousal (Supplementary Figure 3). We gauged the level of arousal by measuring pupil diameter, and we divided the trials according to pupil diameter (small vs. large, Supplementary Figure 3A), and found that the effect of bilateral activity was present in both cases (Supplementary Figure 3B,C,E,F). Once again, responses could be explained based on fast ongoing fluctuations, with no need to include pupil dilation as a predictor (Supplementary Figure 3D,G).</p>
<p>Because ongoing activity changed rapidly and was largely bilateral, its impact could not be estimated through the typical procedure of measuring unilateral activity before stimulus onset (Supplementary Figure 4). Ongoing activity is often estimated from prestimulus measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>), and these estimates are often subtracted from the subsequent measurements. This procedure is likely to be less effective in the face of strong, fast bilateral ongoing activity. Indeed, the cross-correlation between corresponding regions on the two hemispheres typically decreased to 0 in &#x007E;100 ms, and in some mice became negative afterwards (Supplementary Figure 4A). As a result, estimates of bilateral ongoing activity obtained from the unstimulated hemisphere were superior to estimates obtained in the stimulated hemisphere before stimulus onset. This can be seen by dividing all trials into 4 groups, for all combinations of prestimulus activity in the stimulated hemisphere (down vs. up) and poststimulus activity in the unstimulated hemisphere (low vs. high Supplementary Figure 4B). The strong effect of bilateral activity was present in both up and down groups (Supplementary Figure 4C,D,F,G), and responses could be explained based on fast bilateral fluctuations (Supplementary Figure 4E,H).</p>

<sec id="s2f"><title>Bilateral fluctuations do not affect perceptual reports</title>
<p>Do these fast fluctuations in bilateral ongoing activity result in percepts? On the one hand, one might imagine that they do, because they impact cortical areas that are necessary for the performance of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>), Bilateral ongoing fluctuations did not affect the behavior of the mouse in the task (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We divided trials according to whether bilateral ongoing activity in PM was low or high (as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,D</xref>), and computed psychometric curves in each group. The two psychometric curves were essentially identical: there was no effect of bilateral activity on the probability of choosing the correct side (Figure so one might expect that whatever affects their activity will influence the percept of the animal. On the other hand, as the correlation structure of bilateral spontaneous activity differs from that of unilateral sensory responses, it may have little impact on information coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>): interpreted naively, bilateral activations would constitute stimuli with a peculiar mirror symmetry across the vertical midline, which would be unlikely to be confused with actual images. 6A,C), or to choose a no-go response, which would be appropriate when stimulus is zero (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B,D</xref>). We fitted the behavioral responses with a simple probabilistic observer model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>), and measured offset and scale parameters of the perceptual contrast sensitivity function inferred by the model. Neither offset nor scale were significantly affected by bilateral ongoing activity (p &#x003E; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n &#x003D; 7 mice, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E,G</xref>). Similar results were seen when we used other visual areas to measure bilateral activity (p &#x003E; 0.05, n &#x003D; 7 mice in V1, n &#x003D; 5 mice in AL, LM, and RL, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F,H</xref>). These results indicate that the bilateral ongoing activity did not affect perceptual reports.</p>

<p>To estimate the visual component <italic>V</italic>(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic>), we used the average across trials o the activity measured at each stimulus contrast. To estimate the amount of bilateral fluctuation <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) on trial <italic>i</italic>, we measured the activity <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>&#x2032;(<italic>t</italic>) contralateral to the predicted area, subtracting any trial-triggered activity <italic>V</italic>&#x2032;(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic>) that may be seen there:

<p>The weight &#x210E; &#x2264; 1 is a fixed coefficient, and was obtained from trials with no stimulus (0&#x0025; contrast) by linear regression against the contralateral fluorescence.</p>
<p>The additive model provided good estimates of trial-by-trial activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Consider again the activity measured in right area PM in response to 100&#x0025; contrast stimuli presented in the left visual field (as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The bilateral ongoing activity <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) estimated from left area PM showed strong fluctuations across time and trials (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref><sub>1</sub>). These fluctuations were often as large as the visually-evoked response <italic>V</italic>(100, <italic>t</italic>), obtained by averaging activity across trials in right area PM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref><sub>2</sub>). The sum of these two components yields predicted single trial activities in right area PM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref><sub>3</sub>). This predicted activity closely resembles the observed data (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref><sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p>The additive model was most successful when bilateral ongoing fluctuations were measured across symmetrical cortical locations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). We asked whether the model would degrade if bilateral activity <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) was measured not from the contralateral PM but rather from other contralateral areas. Doing so strongly decreased the explained variance: explained variance was highest when the region used to estimate the bilateral activity was contralateral PM or regions near it, and decreased with distance from contralateral PM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the other visual areas (Supplementary Figure 5), confirming that the bilateral ongoing activity contributing to the observed variability is not global, but rather local to individual areas.</p>
<p>This simple additive model worked well in all visual areas, and revealed that bilateral ongoing fluctuations had a much larger effect on cortical activity than evoked visual responses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). In area PM, the additive model explained 58 &#x00B1; 3&#x0025; of the variance (S.E. n &#x003D; 7 mice). This is a very high performance, and the bilateral component is crucial to obtain it. Indeed, the visually evoked responses <italic>V</italic>(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>t</italic>) were only able to account for 12 &#x00B1; 4&#x0025; of the variance. Similar effects were seen in area AM, and to a large extent also in the remaining visual areas (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the model performed well also on the data obtained with voltage imaging (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E,F</xref>). For area PM, for instance, the additive model accounted for up to 34&#x0025; of trial-by-trial variability in the voltage signals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). This value was significantly higher than the variance explained by the visually evoked responses, which is known to be particularly low for voltage signals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Much of the large variability observed across trials when performing widefield imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>), therefore, is not due to imaging noise, but rather to structured ongoing neural activity tightly coordinated across the hemispheres.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>By taking advantage of widefield imaging, we monitored both cortical hemispheres in mice performing a visual detection task, and found that bilateral ongoing activity has a powerful additive impact on sensory processing. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shimaoka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>), voltage and calcium signals exhibited strong bilateral fluctuations in ongoing activity. In both types of signal, the impact of these bilateral fluctuations varied across cortical areas, and was stronger in areas closer to the midline. Two exceptions were the monocular region of area V1, where activity was less bilateral in all conditions, and area M2, where activity was less bilateral during task engagement. Bilateral ongoing fluctuations continued following the onset of the visual stimulus, and typically swamped the resulting unilateral visual responses. Higher bilateral ongoing activity increased visual responses equally at all contrasts, regardless of response amplitude, indicating that the interaction between ongoing activity and visually evoked responses was additive. A simple additive model provided good estimates of trial-by-trial visual response in all visual areas, and revealed that bilateral ongoing fluctuations had a much larger effect on cortical activity than evoked visual responses.</p>
<p>Bilateral fluctuations have been observed in multiple circumstances, but in the absence of overt movements their functional significance is not clear. The cortex exhibits clear bilateral activity during motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Musall et al., 2018</xref>), which is understandable given the symmetry involved in many body movements. It is less clear, however, why there should be bilateral symmetry in sensory responses, and even less clear why there should be symmetry in ongoing activity, both in wakefulness and in anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shimaoka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of their origin, it is likely that bilateral fluctuations are at least partially mediated by callosal connections. A number of brain structures connect the two cerebral hemispheres, including anterior commissure, cingulum, interhemispheric thalamic connections, and corpus callosum. Among these, the corpus callosum is the largest white matter tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres in placental mammalian brains. Ongoing activity is less correlated across hemispheres in mutant mice that lack the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>) and in rats after surgical section of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Magnuson et al., 2014</xref>). However, ongoing bilateral activity is also reported in humans born without a corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that bilateral fluctuations can also be sustained by other brain structures.</p>
<p>Bilateral fluctuation represents shared activity across neurons, which impacts on response variability. Our widefield imaging result conforms to the previous electrophysiological report by Sch&#x00F6;lvinck et al. (2015), that ongoing activity is shared across large proportions of neurons and interacts additively with visually-evoked responses, and that it accounts for a large fraction of trial-by-trial fluctuations in observed visually-evoked activities. The present study extends this idea by demonstrating that such global fluctuation is actually shared across hemispheres, yet in an area-specific manner.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that a full understanding of activity in a population of neurons in one hemisphere may require recordings from the corresponding area of the other hemisphere. Because ongoing activity changed rapidly and was largely bilateral, its impact could not be estimated through the typical procedure of measuring unilateral activity before stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, compared to bilateral activity, activity in the prestimulus period had a smaller impact on evoked responses than simultaneously measured activity in the contralateral hemisphere. Given the specificity that we have observed in bilateral fluctuations, the ideal placement of a sensor in the contralateral hemisphere would be one that monitored the symmetrical populations to the ones of interest. Experiments with this design are emerging in electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rabinowitz et al., 2015</xref>), and a promising strategy would be to pair them with simultaneous widefield imaging.</p>
<p>Even though bilateral fluctuations occurred in regions necessary for the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>), they did not impact detection behavior. Perhaps a downstream readout mechanism removes the bilateral fluctuations by taking the difference of activity on left and right visual cortices. It might thus be easy for the brain to ignore them during perceptual decisions, even though they continue during sensory stimulation and have a powerful additive impact on sensory processing.</p>

<p>The 9 mice (6 males) were implanted with a head post and a thinned or intact skull cranial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Drew et al., 2010</xref>) over the dorsal part of the both cortical hemispheres. An analgesic (Rimadyl) was administered on the day of the surgery (0.05 ml, s.c.), and on subsequent 2 days (in the diet). Anesthesia was obtained with isoflurane at 2-3&#x0025; and kept 1-1.5&#x0025; during surgery. To prevent dehydration during surgery, saline was administered every hour (0.01 ml/g/h, i.p.). Body temperature was maintained at 37&#x00B0;C using a feedback-controlled heating pad, and the eyes were protected with ophthalmic gel. The head was shaved and disinfected with iodine, the cranium was exposed, and the bone was thinned for VSFP animals with a dental drill and a scalpel over the dorsal part of the cortex. A 3D-printed light-isolation cone surrounding the frontal and parietal bones was attached to the skull with cyanoacrylate. Subsequently a metal or 3D-printed head plate was secured with dental cement. After the cement solidified, this opening was filled with transparent cement.</p>

<sec id="s4c"><title>Behavioral task</title>
<p>The general framework of the task and training procedure is found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). The sequence of trial events was as follows. First, the mouse kept the wheel still (quiescent period) to initiate the trial. Second, a visual grating stimulus was presented, and, during an &#x2018;&#x2018;open loop&#x2019;&#x2019; period, wheel movements were ignored. Third, a go tone was played, after which point the wheel turns resulted in movements of the visual stimuli (&#x2018;&#x2018;closed loop&#x2019;&#x2019;). If the mouse turned the wheel such that the stimulus reached the center of the screen, the mouse received water reward (1&#x2013;3 mL). If instead the mouse moved the stimulus by the same distance in the opposite direction, this incorrect decision was penalized with a timeout (typically, 2 s) signaled by auditory noise. In either case, the grating remained locked in its response position for 1 s and then disappeared. In this paper, we added slight modifications to the two-alternative task for GCaMP and VSFP animals. For GCaMP animals, we extended the two-alternative tasks by adding a &#x2018;&#x2018;no-go&#x2019;&#x2019; response option when there was no stimulus. The result is the two-alternative unforced-choice (2AUC) task. Training started on the two-alternative forced-choice task, then we constrained the response window to 1.5 s and added the no-go condition: when the stimulus was absent (zero contrast), mice earned the reward by not turning the wheel (no-go; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) for 1.5 s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). For VSFP animals, we used the 2AFC version of the task, where the mice were trained to hold the wheel after the stimulus presentation at least for 800 ms. If the mice did not respond within 5 s, the trial was aborted. When the stimulus was absent (zero contrast), water reward was randomly assigned to either to the left or right wheel turning.</p>
<p>In subset of mice, we also acquired widefield data during a passive condition, in which the same visual stimuli was applied but the waterspout was retracted. In this condition, the mouse quickly learned to stay still without moving the wheel.</p>
<p>For investigating visually-evoked neural activity and ongoing activity without mice&#x2019;s body movement, we ran custom-made algorithm to detect movement of the wheel, eye blinks and saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Engbert and Kliegl, 2003</xref>). Trials including more than one of these events around the time of the visual stimulus onset (GCaMP: &#x2212;500 &#x007E;200ms; VSFP: - 500&#x007E;800ms) were excluded from the further analysis.</p>

<sec id="s4d"><title>Imaging</title>
<p>We monitored GCaMP/VSFP signals with macroscope based on the tandem lens design and epi-illumination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ratzlaff and Grinvald, 1991</xref>), which we used in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>For GCaMP imaging, excitation light was provided by alternating blue (470 nm) and purple (405 nm) LEDs (Cairn OptoLED, P1110/002/000), through an additional band-pass filter (Semrock FF01-466/40-25 for blue, Chroma ET405/20x for purple). Illumination light passed through a dichroic (425 nm; Chroma T425lpxr), and 3-mm-core optical fiber (Cairn P135/015/003), then reflected off another dichroic (495 nm; Semrock FF495-Di03-50 &#x00D7; 70) to the brain. Emitted light was passed through the second dichroic and emission filter (Edmunds 525/50-55 (86-963)) to single sCMOS camera (PCO Edge 5.5). Imaging was conducted at 35Hz in each purple and blue channel (70 Hz in total) with a nominal spatial resolution of 21.7um/pixel.</p>
<p>For VSFP imaging, excitation light was provided by a blue LED (LEX2-B, Brainvision Inc.), through a band-pass filter at 482nm (FF01-482/35, Semrock Inc.) and a dichroic mirror (FF506-Di03, Semrock Inc.). This blue LED was alternated with red (631 nm) and green (528 nm) LEDs for simultaneous reflectance imaging to estimate blood volume and oxygenation. Fluorescence signals of VSFP FRET chromophores (mKate2 and mCitrine), as well as the reflectance signals were imaged via two of the sCMOS cameras. When the blue LED was turned on, first camera recorded the emitted fluorescence from mCitrine, which was reflected by a second dichroic mirror (FF593-Di03, Semrock Inc.), passed through an emission filter (FF01-543/50-25, Semrock Inc.). The second camera recorded the emitted fluorescence from mKate2, passed through the second dichroic mirror and an emission filter (BLP01-594R-25, Semrock Inc.). When the red and green LEDs were turned on at one time, the first and the second cameras recorded reflectance of cortical surface emitted by the red and green LEDs, respectively. Imaging was conducted at 35 Hz in each blue and red/green channel (total 70Hz), with a nominal spatial resolution of 21.7 &#x03BC;m/pixel.</p>

<sec id="s4e"><title>Signal processing</title>
<p>We used a data compression method by computing the singular value decomposition of the 3D image stack, and reconstructed individual pixel traces for analysis from the top 500 singular values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Steinmetz et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>For GCaMP data, the acquired fluorescence signal was contaminated by signals originating outside of the target fluorophores expressed in neurons. To reduce this artefact, simultaneously measured fluorescence signal excited by the purple LED was scaled by the regression coefficient with the signal excited by the blue LED, and subtracted out from it. Subsequently, to extract timing of firing from relatively slow temporal kinetics of the GCaMP6s, we applied temporal derivative and rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>). Finally the signal was filtered above 7Hz to attenuate signals from heartbeats.</p>
<p>For VSFP data, the red and yellow fluorescence signals were analyzed using the gain-equalization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>), by equalizing the gains at the heart beat frequency between the two cameras. The gain equalization factors were obtained once per recording session at each pixel-basis. To further exclude the hemodynamic signals in the ratiometric signal, simultaneously measured red and green reflectance signals were scaled by the regression coefficient with the ratiometric signal, and subtracted out from the ratiometric signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Finally the signal was filtered below 0.5 Hz and above 7 Hz to eliminate signals from heartbeats.</p>

<sec id="s4f"><title>Identification of sensory areas</title>
<p>Visual stimuli were presented via LCD monitors (ProLite E1980, Iiyama Corp.) placed 19 cm away from the animal. To identify areas 6 visual areas (V1, LM, AL, RL, AM, PM), we used vertical or horizontal bars sweeping across the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</xref>). We built maps of retinotopy then parcellated the activated region into distinct visual areas by identifying changes in the sign of the retinotopic mapping between the screen and the cortical surface. This sign is positive if clockwise circles in the visual field map to clockwise circles on cortex and negative if they map to anti-clockwise circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sereno et al., 1994</xref>). Additionally in VSFP animals, train of auditory or somatosensory stimuli was used to identify these sensory areas. Somatosensory stimuli were air puffs delivered from a pressure injector (Pressure system IIe, Toohey Company) towards the bulk of the whiskers at a pressure of 40 PSI via a silicone tube (0.5 mm open tip diameter). Auditory stimuli were 13 kHz tones at 80 dB SPL via a magnetic speaker (Tucker-Davis Technologies) placed 19 cm away from the animal. We obtained location of the S1 barrel cortex and auditory cortex, by calculating the response amplitude at the stimulation frequency.</p>

<sec id="s4g"><title>Fitting contrast-response curves</title>
<p>To quantify the contrast sensitivity of the recorded signal, we fitted the contrast-response relationship with the Naka-Rushton function:
<disp-formula id="eqn3"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="476333_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic><bold>R</bold></italic> is the neuronal activity, <italic><bold>R<sub>0</sub></bold></italic> is the background discharge, <italic><bold>R<sub>max</sub></bold></italic> is maximal response, <italic><bold>C</bold></italic> is the contrast of grating stimuli, <italic><bold>n</bold></italic> is exponent of the power function, and <italic><bold>C<sub>50</sub></bold></italic> is contrast for half of <italic><bold>R<sub>max</sub></bold></italic>. In each area, we first estimated all the parameters for the curve of grand average. Subsequently we estimated <italic><bold>R<sub>0</sub></bold></italic> and <italic><bold>R<sub>max</sub></bold></italic> for individual curves subdivided by ongoing activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h"><title>Fitting single-trial responses</title>
<p>We fitted single-trial signals with the additive model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref>). To evaluate how much the additive model account for variability in observed activity, we computed explained variance as:
<disp-formula id="eqn4"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="476333_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="476333_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is average across trials and stimulus. We averaged this quantity across trials of >0&#x0025; contrasts to obtain the explained variance in each ROI. Note that the explained variance was measured with cross-validation: weights were estimated based on a training set (0&#x0025; contrast trials) and used to explain the variance of the test set (&#x003E;0&#x0025; contrast trials)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i"><title>Fitting psychometric curves</title>
<p>To quantify the contrast sensitivity of the animal&#x2019;s perceptual report, we fitted the choice probability with multinomial logistic regression (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgess et al. (2017)</xref>). In the model, choices depend on two decision variables, one for choosing L and the one choosing R, depending on the contrast <italic><bold>c<sub>L</sub></bold></italic> and <italic><bold>c<sub>R</sub></bold></italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn5"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="476333_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, <italic><bold>g()</bold></italic> is the function in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>, <italic><bold>b</bold></italic> represent offset toward choosing left or right relative to no-go, and <italic><bold>s</bold></italic> measure the weight assigned to visual evidence. The decision variables, in turn, determine the probabilities <italic>p<sub>L</sub></italic>, <italic>p<sub>R</sub></italic>, <italic>p<sub>0</sub></italic> of choosing L, R, or no-go, and specifically the log odds of choosing correct versus choosing no-go:
<disp-formula id="eqn6"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="476333_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>As the resulting psychometric curves are symmetrical between choosing left and right, we only showed one side in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. We fit the two parameters of the decision variables (<xref rid="eqn6" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 5</xref>) to the data obtained using all trials per animal or all animals through multinomial logistic regression, and optimized the two additional two parameters describing contrast sensitivity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>). After fixing the parameters describing contrast sensitivity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Eq. 3</xref>),we fit the two parameters of the decision variables (<xref rid="eqn5" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 5</xref>) again in each of the two trial groups of high and low bilateral ongoing activity.</p>

<caption><p>Bilateral correlation during the task and during the passive condition. This analysis was performed on 6 mice where we had measured both active and passive condition, and where all 6 visual areas were identified functionally. Two of these mice expressed VSFP (<italic>orange</italic>) and four expressed GCaMP (<italic>green</italic>). The genotypes of the latter was Snap25-GCamp6s (<italic>circles</italic>), or TetO-GCaMP6s;Camk2a-tTA (<italic>diamonds</italic>). For area M2 (<bold>H</bold>), p-value was p &#x003D; 0.0013 before Bonferroni correction, p &#x003D; 0.013 afterwards.</p></caption>

<caption><p>The effects of bilateral ongoing activity were due to fast changes in cortical activation, not to slow changes in cortical state. <bold>A</bold>. Instantaneous amplitude at unstimulated PM (vertical axis) and pre-stimulus fluctuation amplitude between 2-7Hz at stimulated PM (horizontal axis) of single trials in area PM. Each dot represents single trial drawn from one animal. We then set thresholds to divide trials between &#x201C;Synchronized&#x201D; and &#x201C;Desynchronized&#x201D; states (<italic>vertical line</italic>) and between high vs. low instantaneous activity (50-150 ms after stimulus onset, <italic>horizontal line</italic>). <bold>B</bold>. Contrast responses from trials of high (cyan) and low (blue) bilateral ongoing activity in synchronized state in one animal. Black dotted curve indicates grand average across all the trials. Error bars represent median absolute deviation across trials. <bold>C</bold>. Contrast responses from trials of high (magenta) and low (purple) bilateral ongoing activity in desynchronized state in one animal. Black dotted curve indicates grand average across all the trials as in panel B. Error bars represent median absolute deviation across trials. <bold>D</bold>. Offset measured as a vertical distance from the grand average curve, against instantaneous amplitude at unstimulated area PM. Symbol colors indicate trial conditions as in panel A.
