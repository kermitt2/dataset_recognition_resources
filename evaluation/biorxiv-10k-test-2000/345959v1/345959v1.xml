<abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Mitochondrial cristae are critical for efficient oxidative phosphorylation, however, how cristae architecture is precisely organized remains obscure. Here, we discovered that SAM complex directly interacts with MICOS complex to form a supercomplex, SAMICOS, which bridges mitochondrial outer- and inner-membrane by Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis. Mic19, a core component of MICOS, establishes mitochondrial outer- and inner-membrane contact by directly interacting with Sam50 and Mic60, and is required for the assembly of SAMICOS by stabilizing and connecting SAM and MICOS. Interestingly, Mic19 is cleaved by mitochondrial protease OMA1 upon mitochondrial stresses. The cleavage of Mic19 leads to SAMICOS disruption, which causes abnormal mitochondrial morphology, loss of crista junctions, and reduced ATP production even in the presence of SAM and MICOS. Importantly, Sam50 acts as an anchoring point at mitochondrial outer-membrane to guide formation of mitochondrial crista junctions. Therefore, we propose a model that SAM complex integrates with MICOS complex to regulate mitochondrial cristae architecture.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Mitochondria are fully articulated and highly organized organelles which surrounded by two membranes: the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mannella, 2006</xref>). The outer membrane is the first interface and barrier for mitochondria to communicate the substance, energy and information with the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wenz et al., 2014</xref>). The outer membrane possesses a dedicated protein import system, including TOM complex, the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and SAM complex, the mitochondrial sorting and assembly machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hohr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kozjak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wenz et al., 2014</xref>). The inner membrane is consist of the inner boundary membrane (IBM) and the cristae membrane (CM). The IBM is closely apposed to the OMM while the inner membrane protrudes from the IBM into the inner space of the mitochondria formed cristae membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Demongeot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huynen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van der Laan et al., 2016</xref>). Cristae membranes are large tubular invaginations and are thought to increase the local charge density/pH to enhance ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hoppins et al., 2011</xref>). The connections between IBM and the cristae are the crista junctions (CJs) which is relatively uniform narrow, tubular and slot-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cristae and crista junctions are important for mitochondrial organization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). Lots of experimental results revealed that the formation of cristae and crista junctions requires Mgm1 (known as OPA1 in mammals), the dimeric form of the F1FO-ATP synthase (F1FO), the MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) complex, and Prohibitins (PHBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harner et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>). Mgm1, the dynaminlike fusion protein of IMM, mediates the fusion of IMM, it cooperates with dimeric F1FO to stabilize the cristae membranes and to thereby generate the sac-like structure. Assembly of the MICOS complex is proposed to limit the fusion process by forming a crista junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harner et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huynen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). Prohibitins exist as two closely related proteins (PHB1 and PHB2) that localize to the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Merkwirth et al., 2008</xref>). PHBs were reported to assemble into ring-like structures that provide a frame-work to stabilize the structure of crista (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harner et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Merkwirth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Semenzato et al., 2011</xref>). However, So far, how mitochondrial cristae and crista junctions are formed remains an ambiguous question.</p>
<p>Eight subunits of MICOS complex in mammalian are described: Mic60/IMMT, Mic19/CHCHD3, Mic10/MINOS1, Mic23/Mic26/APOO, Mic27/APOOL, Mic13/QIL1, Mic25/CHCHD6 and Mic14/CHCHD10. Mic19 and Mic25 are peripheral membrane protein whereas others are transmembrane protein containing at least one transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Genin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Guarani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Koob et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rampelt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). In this complex, Mic60, Mic19, and Mic10 play a dominant role in cristae membrane structure. That is mainly because of missing any one of these subunits, especially Mic60 and Mic10, will generate more severe cristae phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bohnert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Not only in maintaining cristae architecture, MICOS subunits also possess other capacity: Mic60 and Mic10, two mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, show the ability in bending the liposome membrane in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hessenberger et al., 2017</xref>), Mic60 and Mic19 ablation can affect the mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Mediating mitochondrial contact sites formation is another feature of MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). Mic60, Mic19, and Mic25 which are responsible for the formation of OMM and IMM contact sites are reported in mammalian system and all of them have the potential to bind to the outer membrane protein Sam50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Darshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sastri et al., 2017</xref>). Existing study showed that Sam50, the central component of SAM complex, was also a specific MICOS interaction partner and also play important role in the maintenance of the structure of cristae. Cells missing Sam50 display severe mitochondrial morphology and cristae phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capala et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>). However, it remains not fully understood how the synergistic interactions between SAM and MICOS complex play role in the formation of contact sites and the biogenesis of mitochondrial cristae structure.</p>
<p>In this study, we reported that SAM complex directly interacts with MICOS complex to form a supercomplex, SAMICOS. Mic19 dominantly mediates the interaction between SAM and MICOS, and is required for the assembly and stabilization of SAMICOS. We find that Mic19 can be cleaved at N-terminal by mitochondrial metalloprotease OMA1 after Sam50 depletion or Mic19 overexpression. The cleaved short form of Mic19 (S-Mic19) disrupts the contact between SAM and MICOS and then causes the abnormal mitochondrial morphology and loss of mitochondrial crista junctions, moreover, impairs ATP production. We also put forward the notion that SAM complex can serve as an anchoring point in OMM for the formation of mitochondrial cristae junction. Moreover, Mic25, an important paralog of Mic19, can act as reserves to rescue the interaction between Sam50 and Mic60. In addition, overexpressed Mic25 in Mic19 knockout cells can reconstruct the mitochondrial morphology and crista junctions. Overall, we provide a new mode that OMM and IMM contact regulates the formation of cristae junction.</p>

<sec id="s2a"><title>Mic19 stabilizes SAM and MICOS complexes and bridges SAM and MICOS to form a supercomplex SAMICOS</title>
<p>Mic19, one central subunit of MICOS complex, plays an essential role in maintaining cristae architecture integrity and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">van der Laan et al., 2012</xref>). To further investigate the comprehensive role of Mic19, we used 293T cells transiently expressing Mic19-Flag to perform co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments and identify Mic19 binding proteins by Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MS/MS data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>) showed a number of proteins that may exist in the same complex. In order to confirm the MS/MS data, the co-IP assay and followed immunoblotting revealed that Mic19 interacted with Sam50 (the key component of SAM complex), Mic60 (the core subunit of MICOS), and Mic25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also performed GST-pull down assay to check whether these interactions are direct. Mic19 indeed directly interacted with Sam50 or Mic60 but not Mic25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1A</xref>). Because Mic19 is a core component of MICOS and directly interacts with Mic60 and Sam50, we then examine whether Mic19 depletion affects the integrity of MICOS and SAM complex. We generated Mic19 knockout (KO) HeLa cell line by using CRISPR/Cas9 system mediated genome editing. Immunoblotting revealed that Mic19 knockout not only resulted in a remarkable decrease of Sam50, Metaxin 1 (MTX1), and Metaxin 2 (MTX2) (the subunits of SAM complex), but also markedly reduced Mic60 and Mic10 (the subunits of MICOS complex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but did not affect the level of Mic25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results hinted that Mic19 could simultaneously stabilize SAM and MICOS complexes. To rule out the off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 system, we reintroduced Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag intoMic19-KO HeLa cells (&#x0394;gRNA represents mutated in gRNA targeting site, without altering the amino acid sequence, in order to prevent gRNA binding to the exogenous Mic19). Immunoblotting revealed that the levels of a series of proteins, which are reduced by Mic19 KO, were recovered to the normal levels in Mic19-Flag expressed Mic19-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, Mic10 or Mic25 knockout had no effect on SAM complex subunits (Sam50, Metaxin 1, and Metaxin2) and the other MICOS complex components (Mic60, Mic19 etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figures S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1C</xref>). Furthermore, Sam50 knockdown (short-hairpin mediated RNA interference, shSam50) caused depletion of Metaxin 1 and Metaxin 2, which are its partner in SAM complex, but did not affect Mic60, Mic10, and Mic25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1D</xref>). These results suggested that only Mic19 play a key role in concurrently protecting SAM and MICOS complexes.

Mitochondrial protein samples from HeLa WT cells, Mic19 KO cells and Mic19 knockout recovering Mic19-Flag cells (F) or protein samples from WT and cardiac-specific Mic19 KO mice (G). All the protein samples were subjected to BN-PAGE, and the related complexes were analyzed by western blot analysis with antibody against Mic19, Mic60 and Sam50 respectively. The bands of the complexes are labeled with corresponding boxes. The SAMICOS complex is approximately 2000kDa and the MICOS is approximately 700kDa. The complex, approximately 250kDa, is SAM complexes and &#x223C;125kDa is unidentified complex containing Sam50 accordingly. SDHA, identifying the size of complex II, served as loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="345959_fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To further illustrate the role of Mic19 in connecting SAM and MICOS complexes, we analyzed mitochondria from WT cells (lane 1), Mic19-KO cells (lane 2), and Mic19-KO regained Mic19-Flag cells (lane 3) by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BNPAGE). Antibodies against Mic19 or Mic60 specifically recognized two protein complexes in lane 1 and lane 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). One complex showed a pronounced maximum at around 700kDa, referencing to existing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huynen et al., 2016</xref>), this complex is MICOS because it could not be detected by anti-Sam50 antibody. The other is at about 2000kDa and contains MICOS and SAM complex because it could be detected by anti-Mic19, anti-Mic60, or anti-Sam50 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), thus, we named this supercomplex &#x2018;SAMICOS&#x2019;. SAMICOS may contain 2 SAM and MICOS complexes or some other proteins according to its molecular weight. In addition, the bottom complexes (&#x223C;250kDa or 125kDa) recognized by anti-Sam50 antibody are SAM complex or unidentified complex containing Sam50. However, MICOS, SAM, or SAMICOS complex was not detected after Mic19 depletion (lane 2). In order to verify the credibility of the results, we performed BN-PAGE assay using heart- or liver-specific deficiency of Mic19 mouse mitochondria. Similarly, SAM, MICOS, or SAMICOS complex was depolymerized upon Mic19 deficiency in heart or liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1E</xref>). These results indicate that Mic19 depletion results in the dissociation of the SAM complex and MICOS complex, and constituent subunits also are degraded after dissociating from the complex. Therefore, Mic19 bridges SAM and MICOS to form a supercomplex SAMICOS and is responsible for the stabilization of SAM, MICOS, and SAMICOS complexes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b"><title>Mic19 detached from SAMICOS complexes can be cleaved at N-terminal by mitochondrial protease OMA1</title>
<p>Most of the mitochondrial proteins dissociated from the complex are degraded by mitochondrial proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Quiros et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ruan et al., 2013</xref>). Our previous works have shown that Mic60 degradation, caused by down-regulation of Mic19, is mediated by the mitochondrial protease Yme1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Mic19 depletion also leads to the degradation of Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), therefore, we test whether Sam50 degradation is mediated by Yme1L. Yme1L knockdown inhibited Mic19 knockdown-induced degradation of Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2A</xref>), furthermore, Yme1L physically interacted with Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2B</xref>). These data demonstrate that Yme1L regulates Sam50 degradation. Because Sam50 directly binds to Mic19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>), we examine whether Sam50 is related to Mic19 degradation. To our surprise, instead of causing degradation of Mic19, Sam50 knockdown (shSam50) resulted in the cleavage of Mic19, and formed a short form of Mic19 (S-Mic19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the depletion of Mic60 or Mic25 did not induce Mic19 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figures S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2D</xref>). Next, considering that Mic19 is a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, we investigated whether mitochondrial inner membrane protease Yme1L or OMA1 is responsible for the cleavage of Mic19. Mic19 was cleaved in Yme1L knockout but not in OMA1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), suggesting that OMA1 regulates Mic19 cleavage.

Western blot was performed using indicated antibodies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="345959_fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To determine whether the Mic19 cleavage locates at the N-terminus or C-terminus, Mic19- Flag (Flag tag at the C-terminus) was transiently overexpressed in 293T cells. Unexpectedly, the cleavage of Mic19-Flag was also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2E</xref>). Due to little endogenous Mic19 cleavage in wild-type cells, we speculate that excessive Mic19-Flag, caused by transient expression, may not be completely assembled to SAMICOS complex, and leaving unassembled Mic19 or Mic19-Flag is then cleaved by OMA1. To examine our hypothesis, we built the Mic19-Flag stably overexpressed HeLa cells and treated cells with CCCP (an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, capable of reducing mitochondrial membrane potential and activating OMA1 metalloprotease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>)). As we expected, both endogenous S-Mic19 and exogenous S-Mic19-Flag were detected in CCCP-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), implying unassembled Mic19 can be cleaved at N-terminal. In contrast, in response to OMA1 knockdown (in HeLa cells) or OMA1 knockout (in MEFs), overexpressed Mic19- Flag failed to be cleaved even after CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2F</xref>). In addition, coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that Mic19 interacted with OMA1<sup>E324Q</sup>, a mutation that only blocks the OMA1 protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baker et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results demonstrated that Mic19 is cleaved at N-terminal by mitochondrial protease OMA1 in response to Sam50 downregulation or CCCP treatment.</p>
<p>To ascertain the cutting site of Mic19, we first compared the molecular weight of proteins being displayed in SDS-PAGE, and got an around 3kD size difference that is equivalent to 36 amino acids on average. We then picked up the adjacent 20 amino acids, residues26-39aa in human Mic19, to examine the evolutional conservation. Alignment of this short amino acid sequence from different species showed that this region (26&#x2013;39aa) of Mic19 is highly evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2G</xref>). We then deleted 31-40aa of Mic19 and found the N-terminal processing of Mic19 is terminated after CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, through the alignment, Mic25, another MICOS subunit, is about 90 percent homologous with Mic19 in this twenty amino acid sequence, and only two amino acids &#x2018;VN&#x2019; of Mic25 is different from that in Mic19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Meanwhile, we searched the downstream sequence right after the site number 39 and found that Mic19 protein sequence in some species (like Equus caballus) starts from site 36 of human Mic19 right behind the two un-conserved amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2G</xref>). The un-conserved character within this sequence indicates that these two amino acids may be critical for cleavage of Mic19. Importantly, exogenous Mic25-Flag is un-cleavable upon CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), so we mutated &#x2018;ID&#x2019; in Mic19 to &#x2018;VN&#x2019; (Mic19<sup>ID33-34VN</sup>) and implemented in a manner similar as control did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). No cleavage at the N-terminal of Mic19<sup>ID33-34VN</sup> was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that amino acids &#x2018;ID&#x2019; of Mic19 is the site of cleavage. To eliminate the possibility that this two amino acids are important for OMA1 binding but not cleavage, we co-expressed Mic19-Flag or Mic19<sup>ID33-34VN</sup>-Flag with OMA1<sup>E324Q</sup>-Myc in 293T cells, co-immunoprecipitation assay and followed immunoblotting revealed that both Mic19-Flag and Mic19<sup>ID33-34VN</sup>-Flag interacted with OMA1<sup>E324Q</sup>-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figures S2H</xref>), demonstrating that &#x2018;ID&#x2019; is OMA1 cleavage site but not binding site. To further test whether two amino acids are indispensable for the OMA1 cleavage, we replaced the &#x2018;VN&#x2019; in Mic25 with &#x2018;ID&#x2019; (Mic25<sup>VN35-36ID</sup>) and examined the processing of Mic25<sup>VN35-36ID</sup>. OMA1-cleavable form of Mic25<sup>VN35-36ID</sup> was displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2J</xref>). Therefore, the inter-paralog replacement of two amino acids endows Mic19 obvious resistance and Mic25 more susceptible to OMA1 cleavage. Overall, the processing site of Mic19 by OMA1 is right after the &#x2018;ID&#x2019; at its N terminal.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>The interaction between Mic19 and Sam50 is required for the integrity of SAMICOS complex</title>
<p>To explore the function of Mic19 cleavage, we firstly investigated whether Mic19 cleavage affects the interactions between Mic19 and other proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay and GST-pull down assay revealed that S-Mic19-Flag but not Mic19 (1-35aa)-Flag (N-terminal 35 amino acids of Mic19) directly interacted with Mic60, and Mic19 (1-35aa)-Flag but not S-Mic19-Flag specifically binds to Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). These results demonstrated that Mic19 stretches out its N-terminal to physically interact with Sam50, leaving its CHCH domain directly binding to the Mic60. Thus, the interaction between Mic19 and Sam50 was disrupted after Mic19 cleavage by OMA1. We then examined the effect of disrupted interaction between Mic19 and Sam50 on SAMICOS complex. We reintroduced the Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag, SMic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag or Mic19 <sup>(ID33-34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag in Mic19 KO HeLa cells. Mitochondria from WT cells, Mic19 KO cells, Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag cells or S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells were then analyzed by BN-PAGE. SAMICOS complex was detected in WT (lane 1) or Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells (lane 3) but not in Mic19 KO (lane 2) or S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells (lane 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, MICOS complex (&#x223C;700kDa) were still maintained in S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that S-Mic19 is enough for assembly of MICOS complex. In addition, immunoblotting revealed that MICOS subunits Mic60 and Mic10 were recovered in Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag, Mic19 <sup>(ID33-34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag and S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed-Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, Sam50 was only recovered in Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag and Mic19 <sup>(ID33- 34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag but not in S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that SAMICOS is disrupted in S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed-Mic19 KO cells because of the disappearance of Sam50. Therefore, the interaction between Mic19 and Sam50 is required for the integrity of SAMICOS complex.

<p>To investigate the role of SAMICOS in mitochondrial morphology and structure, Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag, S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag or Mic19 <sup>(ID33-34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag was expressed in Mic19 KO HeLa cells. Mitochondrial morphology of cells stably expressing mitochondrial matrix-targeted GFP (Mito-GFP) was visualized by confocal microscopy. Remarkably, almost all the Mic19 KO HeLa cells showed the &#x2018;Expanded and spherical&#x2019;, but not fragmented, mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): thicker mitochondria form the &#x2018;head&#x2019; and the rest normal mitochondria are the &#x2018;tail&#x2019;. After re-expression of Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag or Mic19 <sup>(ID33-34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag in Mic19 KO cells, which results in restoration of SAMICOS complex, the normal tubular mitochondria morphology were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Surprisingly, some &#x2018;large spherical mitochondria&#x2019; appeared in S- Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>- Flag expressed-Mic19 KO cells in which MICOS is restored but SAMICOS is not recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), indicating that SAMICOS regulates mitochondrial morphology.

The appearance of large spherical mitochondria in shMic60, shSam50, or S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag cells indicates that this specific mitochondrial morphology is probably due to the disrupted interaction between Mic19 and Sam50.

<p>We and others have shown that MICOS complex key subunits, especially Mic60 and Mic10, can affect mitochondrial cristae conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alkhaja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Since Mic60 and Mic10 expression were recovered in S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells, we speculated that cristae phenotype should be normal. However, the crista junctions, analyzed by TEM, were disappeared in S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells compared with WT or Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further rule out the possibility that the decrease of Sam50 resulted in the disappearance of crista junctions (CJs) in S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells, we next reintroduced Sam50 into S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells to directly confirm the role of interaction between Mic19 and Sam50 in cristae patterning. Compared with S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag alone, S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag and Myc-Sam50 co-expressed Mic19 KO cells maintained Sam50, Mic60 and Mic10 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>), but still could not restore crista junctions (CJs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>); in addition, mitochondrial morphology in the co-expressed cells still showed &#x2018;large sphere&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figures S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3C</xref>). Furthermore, BN-PAGE assays revealed that S-Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag and Myc-Sam50 co-expressed Mic19 KO cells still loss SAMICOS complex although they maintained SAM and MICOS complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We also investigate the role of SAMICOS complex in energy metabolism. Disrupted SAMICOS, even in the presence of SAM and MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), resulted in significantly reduced ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Therefore, SAMICOS assembled by interaction of Mic19 and Sam50 is indispensable for regulation of mitochondrial morphology, crista junctions (CJs) formation, and ATP production.</p>

<sec id="s2e"><title>Sam50 acting as an anchoring point in mitochondrial outer membrane is required for formation of mitochondrial crista junctions</title>
<p>Sam50 acting as the N-terminal binding protein of Mic19, just like a cap, protects the N-terminus of Mic19 from mitochondrial proteases in order to maintain the intact of Sam50- Mic19-Mic60 axis. So as the representative of the outer membrane protein, what is the role of Sam50 in the formation of crista junctions? We take short-time depleted Sam50 strategies, and to rule out the possibility that the cleavage of Mic19 is the primary effect leading to cristae deformation, we performed Sam50 knockdown (shSam50) in WT cells, Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag or Mic19 <sup>(ID33-34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells, respectively. In response to shSam50, Mic60 and Mic10 were unaltered no matter whether Mic19 is cleaved or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Mitochondrial morphology in above cell lines was also measured by confocal microscopy. All the cell lines depleting Sam50 (shSam50, 5days) showed remarkably fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). These results suggest that Sam50 directly regulates mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondrial cristae remodeling was then examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Most of cristae in WT mitochondria connected with inner membrane and presented regularly arranged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); however, almost all cristae of shSam50 mitochondria pinched off from the inner membrane, leading to crista junctions collapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The similar crista were also found in shSam50 plus Mic19<sup>&#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag or Mic19 <sup>(ID33-34VN) &#x0394;gRNA</sup>-Flag expressed Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). These results indicate that Sam50 may act as an anchoring point in mitochondria outer membrane for crista junctions. To further verified this hypothesis, Flag-Sam50 stably expressed in COS7 cells were analyzed by using stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) techniques. Distribution of Flag-Sam50 on the mitochondrial outer membrane are dotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), importantly, the location of about 30&#x0025; Sam50 are over against to crista junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).Therefore, Sam50 may serve as an anchoring point for MICOS complex, and SAM connect MICOS through the sam50-Mic19- Mic60 axis to anchor the crista junctions at a specific site of mitochondrial inner membrane.

<sec id="s2f"><title>Restoration of Sam50-X-Mic60 axis by overexpression of Mic25 in Mic19 KO cells can reconstruct mitochondrial crista junctions and recover ATP production</title>
<p>Since the Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis plays a decisive role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and structure. Destroying either of three subunits can disrupt the axis, however, only Mic60 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>) or Sam50 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jian et al., 2018</xref>), but not Mic19 knockout, induced large spherical mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4B</xref>), suggesting that there may be another component (called X) which can replace Mic19 to form Sam50-X-Mic60 axis after Mic19 knockout. Of all the subunits in the MICOS complex, only Mic25 has this possibility as a candidate, because Mic25 is the only MICOS subunit that exhibits 36&#x0025; overall sequence identity and 80&#x0025; similarity to Mic19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zerbes et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Mic60 depletion reduced Mic25, while Mic19 knockout just decreased Mic60 but not altering Mic25 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, Mic25 is also capable of forming direct interaction with Sam50 and Mic60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). Therefore, we investigate whether there is functional overlap between Mic19 and Mic25. We firstly depleted Mic25 in WT or Mic19 KO cells to examine the functional overlap in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. Mic25 knockout did not affect the level of other MICOS subunits and mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4C</xref>). However, the depletion of Mic25 (shMic25) in Mic19 KO cells caused mitochondria shape converting to &#x2018;large spherical&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>), and led to an obvious further reduction of Mic60, Mic10 and Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4C</xref>). Similar phenotype was recurrence when we disrupted Mic19 (shMic19) in Mic25 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6F, 6G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4C</xref>). These results demonstrate that Mic25 functionally overlap with Mic19, but Mic19 play a dominant role in mediating Sam50-X-Mic60 axis. Because Mic19 dominant Sam50-X-Mic60 axis, we then investigated whether Mic19 protein abundance is much higher than that of Mic25. We compared the relative protein levels of Mic19 and Mic25 in cells by comparing normalized Mic19-Flag with normalized Mic25-Flag. The level of endogenous Mic19 and Mic25 are comparable, and Mic25 only slightly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figures S4D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4G</xref>), which further confirmed that Mic19 dominants Sam50-X-Mic60 axis. In addition, Mic25 KO cells display normal mitochondrial cristae architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4I</xref>), suggesting that Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis plays a key role in mitochondrial cristae organization. Therefore, under normal conditions, Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis mainly exist; after Mic19 knockout, the unaffected Mic25 works together with the rest Mic60 and Sam50, and forms Sam50-Mic25-Mic60 axis to partially maintain the function of Sam50-X-Mic60 axis.

<p>Since Mic25 can act as &#x2018;spare bearing&#x2019;, we investigated whether overexpressed Mic25 in Mic19 KO cells can form dominant axis to restore the mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contact. Overexpressed Mic25-Flag (about 10 fold of endogenous Mic25) in Mic19 KO cells recovered normal mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6H</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6J</xref>). In addition, the level of other MICOS subunits was also recovered in Mic19 KO cells overexpressing Mic25-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). These results suggested that overexpressed Mic25 can fill the position of Mic19 to form a new dominant axis with Sam50 and Mic60, and the new formed Sam50-Mic25-Mic60 axis can also reconnected the SAMICOS complex depolymerized by Mic19 depletion. Then, we examined whether overexpression of Mic25 can reshape the ultrastructure of mitochondria. Mitochondrial crista junctions reconstructed in Mic25 overexpressed Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6L</xref>). Moreover, Mic19 KO resulted in reduced ATP level, but ATP were recovered to normal level in Mic25 overexpressed Mic19 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). Therefore, our data indicate that Mic25 is a compensatory factor for assembling SAMICOS complex, which bridges mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contact and regulates mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure.</p>

<sec id="s2g"><title>The model of mitochondrial cristae organization</title>
<p>Based on previous reports and our findings, we formulate a theoretical model to illustrate mitochondrial cristae organization and the de novo formation of crista junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>):
<fig id="fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Theoretical model of SAM-MICOS complex functions on the formation of the CJs structure.</bold></p><p>In this schematic, the mitochondrial outer membranes and inner membrane form an arc. In the arc, we simulated the formation of mitochondrial cristae and CJ structures. In the inside of the arc, the large arrow represents the direction of the formation or disappearance for mitochondrial cristae and CJ structures. If the tail of the large arrow changes from &#x2018;thin&#x2019; to &#x2018;thick&#x2019;, it indicates the formation process. If the tail of the large arrow changes from &#x2018;thick&#x2019; to &#x2018;thin&#x2019;, it indicates the disappearance process. In the innermost of the arc, simulated mitochondria represent the final mitochondrial cristae and CJs structure in each model &#x3010;CJs, cristae junction site; Blue lines, the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM); Red lines, the mitochondrial inner boundary membrane (IBM) and cristae membrane (CM)&#x3011;.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="345959_fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><bold>A.</bold> When de novo cristae formed, monomeric F1FO assembled into dimeric F1FO providing positive curvature to crista membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harner et al., 2016a</xref>). At the same time, Mic60 targets to inner membrane forming an anchor site, which is called nucleation, to recruit other MICOS subunits including Mic19, Mic10, and Mic25. Mic10 oligomerization can bend mitochondrial inner membranes and then stretch the mitochondrial inner membrane toward the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbot et al., 2015</xref>). Mic19 directly binding to Mic60, stretches out its N-terminal to physically interact with Sam50, and then close the distance between MICOS and SAM complex to form the contact site of mitochondrial outer- and inner-membrane. OPA1 oligomerization can be used to regulate the contraction of the cristae junction (CJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harner et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hering et al., 2017</xref>). In the end, curvature and fusion of inner membranes is halted when integrated SAMICOS complex is formed, meanwhile, CJ is generated.</p>
<p><bold>B.</bold> upon Mic19 depletion, the Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis was disrupted, and then the associated subunits Sam50, MTXs, Mic60, and Mic10 were degraded by the corresponding proteases, resulting in SAMICOS complex was interrupted and depolymerized. Although there is still the Sam50-Mic25-Mic60 axis, it is not enough to maintain the contact between mitochondrial inner- and outer- membranes. Therefore, as there is no &#x2018;blocking effect&#x2019; of the SAMICOS complex, the CJs structure continues to shrink under the regulation of OPA1 and other factors and finally falls off from the inner membrane.</p>
<p>At the same time, the nascent cristae membrane continues produce in the absence of the SAMICOS super-complex, and the membrane fusion proceeds as that in WT cells, but cannot halt. Thus, the final cristae forms are the stacked closed membrane sheets lacking connection with the IBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harner et al., 2016b</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>C.</bold> Expression of S-Mic19-Flag in Mic19 KO cells restores the MICOS complex, but without restoring Sam50, the Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis cannot be formed. Although, when we simultaneously recover S-Mic19-Flag and exogenous Myc-sam50, the Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis still cannot be formed due to the defect of Mic19 N-terminal. Therefore, although all the elements, dimeric F1FO, OPA1, MICOS complex and SAM complex, are available, the CJ structure cannot be formed in the absence of interaction of SAM and MICOS complex.</p>
<p><bold>D.</bold> Mic25, which is not affected in the absence of Mic19, could form a Sam50-Mic25- Mic60 axis with the &#x2018;residua&#x2019; Sam50 and Mic60. However, this axis is not sufficient to maintain CJ due to loss of the dominant Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis. When Mic25 is overexpressed, plentiful Mic25 will recruit more Sam50 and Mic60 to generate more Sam50-Mic25-Mic60 axis. When a sufficient number of axes work together, it will reshape the SAMICOS super-complex. As a result, the inner mitochondrial membrane structure CJ can be reconstructed.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) complex is necessary for the formation of cristae organization and contact site between mitochondrial outer membrane and the inner boundary membrane. In the mammal, multiple subunits of MICOS complex were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van der Laan et al., 2016</xref>). However, how the contact between mitochondrial outer and inner membrane and crista structure are formed remain elusive. In this study, we report that Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis serves as a dominate &#x2018;bridge&#x2019; to connect mitochondrial outer and inner membrane; moreover, Mic19 actually acts as a dominant bearing to link SAM and MICOS complex and form a supercomplex SAMICOS. SAMICOS regulates mitochondrial morphology and determines mitochondrial cristae architecture.</p>
<p>Mic19 can be cleaved at N-terminal by mitochondrial metalloprotease OMA1 when Mic19 detached from Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis either by depleting Sam50 or overexpressing Mic19. Why was little Mic19 cleaved under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>)? It is probably because the MICOS complex is assembled efficiently and precisely in proportion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>), the expression of Mic19 is strictly regulated and there is no &#x2018;dissociative&#x2019; Mic19; additionally, Sam50 bound to its N-terminus of Mic19 may make the cut site to be hidden. Thus, Mic19 cannot be cut under normal condition. However, the stresses, which cause Sam50 downregulation, should induce Mic19 cleavage.</p>
<p>In the last dozen years, MICOS and its subunits have been identified to be critical for mitochondrial membranes contact and cristae organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Darshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">John et al., 2005</xref>). However, Mic60 or Mic19 deletion always accompanies with the disruption of whole MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). So it is hard to verify whether Mic60 or Mic19 alone is sufficient to regulate the cristae structure. Recently, Mic60 was reported to have the ability to bend liposomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hessenberger et al., 2017</xref>), making Mic60 being a dominant player in stabilizing and promoting cristae formation. In addition, in vitro assay also revealed that Mic10 oligomerization can efficiently bend liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbot et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that Mic60 and Mic10 are cristae organization regulating effectors, and MICOS complex itself is supposed to be sufficient for cristae formation and organization. However, in our study, mitochondrial outer membrane protein Sam50, a core component of SAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kozjak et al., 2003</xref>), are severely involved in cristae organization. Sam50 knockdown led to abnormal cristae and disappearance of crista junctions, without affecting MICOS complex integrity and its core subunits Mic60 and Mic10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which gives us a hint that outer membrane SAM complex is also indispensable for crista junctions formation and we put forward a new viewpoint that Sam50 acted as an anchoring point in mitochondrial outer membrane for the structure of mitochondrial crista junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>). These data suggest that mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contact, linked by a supercomplex SAMICOS, play a critical role in cristae organization.</p>
<p>Mic19 depletion resulted in degradation of Sam50, Mic60, and Mic10, subsequently failed assembly of both MICOS and SAM complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1G</xref>). The short form of Mic19 after cleavage (S-Mic19) maintained the ability to assemble and stabilize MICOS complex by interacting with Mic60, but failed to bind to Sam50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The feather of S-Mic19 provides a good tool to study the role of individual MICOS complex in mitochondrial morphology and structure. Mic19 KO cells displayed abnormal mitochondrial morphology, loss of crista junctions and reduced ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>), S-Mic19 expression in Mic19 KO cells recovered MICOS complex, but failed to restore mitochondrial morphology, cristae structure and ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>). Therefore, MICOS and SAM complexes cooperate together to form a supercomplex SAMICOS, which ensures mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contact and determine mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure. Additionally, our identified SAMICOS complex is similar with MIB complex, a previous reported supercomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ott et al., 2012</xref>), but the mechanism of MIB complex assembly and the role of MIB complex in mitochondrial morphology and structure are largely unknown.</p>
<p>Mic19 is highly conserved from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to human. However, Mic25, an important paralog of Mic19, only exists in Metazoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rampelt et al., 2017</xref>), and the role of Mic25 in the MICOS complex is still unclear since Mic25 depletion does not affect mitochondrial ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4I</xref>). In this study, we revealed that there is a functional overlap between Mic19 and Mic25. Mic19 possesses dominant position to form Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis, which directly links SAM and MICOS complex to form SAMICOS supercomplex for mediating mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contact. While Mic25 function as a back-up component, which can substitute for Mic19 to form Sam50-Mic25-Mic60 axis with the residual Sam50 and Mic60 when Mic19 is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). Importantly, Mic19 could be cleaved by OMA1 under some stresses such as CCCP treatment, which results in disruption of Sam50-Mic19-Mic60 axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>), but Mic25 could not be cleaved and remain stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Therefore, the Sam50-Mic25-Mic60 axis will protect the mitochondria to suffer some serious stresses. Mic19 plays a dominant role, whereas, Mic25 plays &#x2018;Emergency Protective&#x2019; role when Mic19 was deleted. It is likely not only to be a more economical, but also a more secure mechanism for the survival of multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Taken together, the main function of Mic19 or Mic25 is linking protein to connect and stabilize SAMICOS super-complex. The synergistic contact of mitochondrial outer and inner membrane mediated by SAMICOS is critical for the establishment and maintenance of mitochondrial cristae architecture.</p>

<sec id="s8a2"><title>Isolation of mitochondria and BN-PAGE analysis</title>
<p>Homogenization of cells or tissues and solubilization of mitochondria for BN-PAGE were performed according to the protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wittig et al., 2006</xref>). We optimized the procedure for isolation of HeLa cells mitochondria: a 100-mm dish of &#x223C;90&#x0025; confluent cells was digested and collected in a 2.0ml EP tubes, and the cell pellet re-suspended in cell homogenization buffer (83mM sucrose, 6.6mM imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0), then ultrasonic disrupt cell membranes on ice with the condition(1&#x0025; Power, hit 1s, stop 4s, one minute in total). Centrifuge for 10 min at 700g to clear unbroken cells or cell nucleus, and the supernatant subsequently was centrifuged for 5 min at 10000g to collect the pellet containing the crude mitochondria. The pellet further resuspended and centrifuge for 10 min at 10000g to collect the mitochondria. Isolated mitochondrial were re-suspended in solubilization buffer A (50mM sodium chloride, 50mM Imidazole/HCL, 2mM 6-aminohexanoic acid and 1mM EDTA PH7.0 at 4&#x00B0;C) on ice and lysed by the addition of &#x223C;2&#x0025; digitonin for 30min. The samples were separated on 4&#x2013;14&#x0025; blue native polyacrylamide gels. The gel was transferred to PVDF and immunoblotted with the anti-Mic60, anti-Mic19, anti-Sam50 and anti-SDHA or anti-Ndufb8 antibody respectively.</p>
