<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Rational design and directed evolution have proved to be successful approaches to increase catalytic efficiencies of both natural and artificial enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, a comprehensive understanding of how evolution shapes the energy landscape of catalysis remains a fundamental challenge. Protein dynamics is widely recognized as important, but due to the inherent flexibility of biological macromolecules it is often difficult to distinguish which conformational changes are directly related to function. Here, we used directed evolution on an impaired mutant of the human proline isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) and identify two second-shell mutations that partially restore its catalytic activity. We show both kinetically, using NMR spectroscopy, and structurally, by room-temperature X-ray crystallography, how local perturbations propagate through a large allosteric network to facilitate conformational dynamics. The increased catalysis selected for in the evolutionary screen could be rationalized entirely by accelerated interconversion between the two catalytically essential conformational sub-states, which are both captured in the high-resolution X-ray ensembles at room temperature. Our data provide a glimpse of the evolutionary trajectory of an enzyme&#x2019;s energy landscape and shows how subtle changes can fine-tune its function.</p>

<sec>
<p>The importance of protein dynamics in enzyme function has been under extensive investigation by experimental and computational methods and has become more widely accepted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, because proteins are inherently flexible, assigning a direct functional role to specific conformational changes has proved challenging. For human peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase CypA, a combination of biophysical experimental techniques has elucidated general principles of the energy landscape during catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Since evolutionary selection acts on function, a new challenge is to understand how evolution shapes these energy landscapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This challenge is best exemplified by the common implication of protein dynamics as speculative explanation for the impressive functional improvements achieved via directed evolution where often only minimal structural changes are observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Here, we experimentally characterize changes in the energy landscape that emerge from directed evolution of CypA for enhanced catalytic activity. We find a direct correspondence of increased protein dynamics and faster catalysis along an evolutionary trajectory.</p>
<p>To directly observe the changes in an enzyme&#x2019;s energy landscape upon directed evolution, we turned to a previously designed second-shell mutation, S99T, in CypA that had three effects: inverting the equilibrium between two states that are essential for catalysis, decreasing their interconversion rate, and causing a parallel reduction in catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Can we restore the catalytic function via directed evolution and discern how the acquired mutations compensate for the impaired conformational dynamics of the S99T mutant at the molecular level&#x003F; To enable directed evolution on S99T CypA, first a 96-well plate screen was developed that reports on the enzymatic activity of CypA. Proline isomerase activity is difficult to screen because of its high thermal background rate (2&#x2013;9 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Additionally, there are several proline isomerases in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which complicates screening in cell lysate. To overcome these limitations, we took advantage of the <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> phytopathogenic protease AvrRpt2, which is activated by eukaryotic, but not prokaryotic, cyclophilin homologs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We expressed a library of CypA S99T variants created by random mutagenesis, added inactive AvrRpt2 to cell lysate and monitored the cleavage of an AvrRpt2 substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Besides revertants to wild-type CypA (Ser99), we identified a variant (S99T/C115S) with increased activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). A second round of screening of S99T/C115S CypA identified an additional mutation (I97V) with a further increase in activity. Extensive efforts to further improve enzymatic activity by many more rounds of evolution were unsuccessful. Both gain-of-function mutations are in proximity of Thr99, but not in direct contact with the peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Each mutation contributes additively to the increase in activity, measured as k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and is consistent across two substrate peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Substrate binding affinities are only slightly changed relative to the S99T mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) suggesting that the two mutations function by modulating the turnover rate rather than substrate binding.</p>

<p>To determine whether the rescue in catalysis is due to faster protein motion, we performed NMR dynamics experiments on the S99T, S99T/C115S and S99T/C115S/I97V mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">6</xref>). Previous NMR CPMG dispersion experiments suggested a direct link between the speed of a conformational change in a dynamic network, labeled group-I, for both wild-type (WT) and S99T CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, red)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, a second dynamic process, group-II, comprised of loops adjacent to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>, blue), is insensitive to mutation and displayed faster dynamics. Despite the lack of correlation between the dynamics and catalysis in the group-II residues in S99T, these residues have recently been proposed to be directly linked to catalysis in CypA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To understand the changes in the energy landscape during the directed evolution that led to faster enzymes, we first turned to well-established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>N-CMPG experiments. Interestingly, the exchange contribution, R<sub>ex</sub>, for group-I residues gets bigger with consecutive rescue mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that these mutations increase the slow interconversion rate from the major to minor state (i.e., R<sub>ex</sub> &#x003D; <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="185009_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>). We note that the fast loop motion of group-II (residues 65-80) is observed in all enzyme forms and remains essentially unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a-c,e,g</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">3</xref>).</p>

<p>For a quantitative understanding of the mechanism underlying the increased catalysis along the directed evolution trajectory, we applied a powerful NMR method for studying systems in slow exchange, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>N-CEST experiments identified a large number of residues in slow exchange in all mutant forms of CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c-h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">6</xref>) and delivered two key results. First, for the rescue mutants we observe two distinct slow dynamic clusters that differ in kinetics and populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5</xref>). The exchange profiles of 46 residues for the double-, and 55 residues for the triple-mutant were globally fit to a linear, three-state exchange model (see Online Methods). Second, we discover a gradual increase in the interconversion rate from the major to the minor conformation for the slow process centered around group-I residues (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="185009_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> 2.3 &#x00B1; 0.1 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for S99T, 8.2 &#x00B1; 0.4 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for S99T/C115S and 11.5 &#x00B1; 0.5 s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for S99T/C115S/I97V, respectively).</p>
<p>NMR relaxation experiments enable us to &#x201C;see&#x201D; the prevalence of exchange on different time scales and to unravel their importance in biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The remarkable correspondence between <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="185009_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>) corroborates our hypothesis that the increased dynamics of group-I residues is indeed responsible for the rescue in enzymatic activity. The good correlation between the chemical shift differences, &#x0394;&#x03B4;<sub>AB</sub> and &#x0394;&#x03B4;<sub>AC</sub>, in the two rescue mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>) indicates that the exchange processes are the same by nature. The newly identified second slow exchange process is located on the opposite side of the protein and partially overlaps with the faster loop motion detected by CPMG experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e,g</xref>). The rather large chemical shift differences observed for this exchange process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>, green squares) agree well with the predicted values of going to a more extended/unfolded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>) and are, therefore, unlikely to be relevant for catalysis.</p>

<p>Since overall turnover in WT is dictated by <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="185009_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and occurs on similar timescales in both the apo enzyme and during turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, we needed to confirm that such a correspondence between the measured dynamics in the apo and turnover protein holds true for the mutants. Therefore, CPMG and CEST experiments were performed on S99T during enzymatic turnover of a substrate peptide. These experiments on the mutants proved to be difficult and only possible for S99T due to stability, and the weak affinity for the peptides allowed for a maximum of &#x007E;70&#x0025; saturation. For S99T during catalysis, we indeed observe both fast loop movement, and slow conformational dynamics in the group-I residues, very similar to the apo protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c-e</xref>). Together these data show that the intrinsic dynamics in the group-I residues in the mutants are rate-limiting for the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p>To reveal the structural basis of the increased dynamics in the group-I residues and hence increased catalysis along the evolutionary trajectory, we collected room-temperature X-ray data for S99T/C115S/I97V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Alternate conformations were identified using qFit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and the final multiconformer model was obtained after subsequent manual adjustments and occupancy refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). A swap of the major/minor states from WT to S99T/C115S/I97V is observed for the group-I residues, thereby directly delivering the atomic structures of the conformations for which we measured their interconversion rate by NMR. Both the C115S and I97V mutations subtly reduce the amino acid size, and combined partially restore the &#x201C;Phe113-in&#x201D; conformation as a minor conformation that can now be directly observed in the electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>,d-f). The interpretation of increased conformational heterogeneity of Phe113 and Thr99 was additionally confirmed by an alternative ensemble refinement method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). The size reduction by the C115S mutation could contribute to the faster transition between the major and minor conformation due to the relief of a clash between the larger sulfur atom and Thr99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The connection between these alternate conformations and the collective fitting of the NMR dynamics is further buttressed by analysis of contacts between alternative conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, which identifies a network across the protein that coincides with the group-I residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4g</xref>). While the detection of alternate conformations by X-ray diffraction does not per se deliver information about correlated motions, a detailed analysis of the steric constraints of group-I residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d-f</xref>) exposes how motions from the active site are propagated in a correlated manner. These structural results, together with the characterization of collective dynamics by NMR, reveal how the mutations selected by directed evolution have rewired the internal packing to increase the dynamics of Phe113 correlated with surrounding group-I residues during the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p>Why did additional rounds of directed evolution fail to yield further improvement in the catalytic rate&#x003F; We speculate that the enzyme may be in a local minimum in the fitness landscape, and that a specific combination of mutations is needed for further improvement, including mutations that are neutral or mildly deleterious mutations on their own, in agreement with the dominance of epistasis in protein evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Characterizing how directed evolution shaped the energy landscape for enhanced catalytic activity by solely increasing the conformational interconversion rates in a specific dynamic network has broad implications for resolving controversies about the role of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis of modern enzymes, and in discovering the mechanism of improved catalysis via directed evolution. We briefly discuss both points in respect to pertinent current views in these fields. Fueled by a strong dispute about protein dynamics impact on catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, the field has focused on characterizing several enzymes mechanistically in great detail using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, including CypA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. A two-state ensemble calculation using exact NOEs as constraints revealed an open- and closed-state of free CypA with respect to the position of the 64-74 loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The authors postulate that this loop dynamics is directly linked to catalysis via long-range concerted motions extending to the active site. This model is incompatible with the loop dynamics measured here, which remains fast for all CypA forms and is not correlated to catalytic turnover. In contrast, the group-I residues could be directly linked to catalysis via concurring changes in dynamics between WT, S99T, and the evolved enzyme forms, and catalytic turnover rates. This highlights the importance of NMR dynamics measurements and their quantitative comparison to corresponding changes in catalytic rates, which cannot be extracted from an ensemble-averaged NOE-based structure calculation.</p>
<p>The slowness of conformational interconversion in CypA requires enhanced computational sampling methods for MD simulations. Transitions between the experimentally determined conformational states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> were calculated using parallel-tempering metadynamics resulting in a free energy difference for S99T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> that is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of &#x2212;2.5 kcal/mol obtained here from the CEST data. A two-state ensemble for the cis- and trans-peptide bound CypA calculated by replica-exchange MD simulations in combination with NMR constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> show only minimal protein conformational differences compared to the starting crystal structures (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). This is in sharp contrast to our NMR dynamics for WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and S99T during catalysis measured here, which clearly shows that conformational sub-states interconvert across the core catalytic network and that this rate is correlated to catalysis.</p>
<p>It is notable that the function of CypA was modulated by mutations that do not directly contact the substrate. While the results of numerous &#x201C;second shell&#x201D; mutations emerging from directed evolution experiments have been interpreted based on speculative links between protein dynamics and changes in activity, experimental evidence of alterations of populations or kinetics of alternative conformations has been sparse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Here, the increased dynamics can be rationalized by the ability of Phe113, which directly abuts the substrate, to transition between different rotameric states. This transition is controlled by the repacking of alternative conformations of core residues, such as Thr99, and is enabled by the decreased bulk of the mutated residues (Cys&#x003E;Ser; Ile&#x003E;Val). NMR spectroscopy directly reveals how the kinetics of these transitions between alternative internal packing arrangements controls the increased catalytic activity accumulated during directed evolution. The slow dynamics associated with the catalytic cycle of CypA, and likely for many other enzymes, are only now becoming accessible to molecular simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, the lessons of how non-active site mutations can alter conformational dynamics, derived from our integrated analysis of room-temperature X-ray data and NMR dynamics measurements, could be applied more broadly to aid the long-term goal of rationally improving directed evolution.</p>

<title>Library Screen</title>
<p>Mutant libraries were created using error prone PCR as in Rockah-Shmuel <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc31">31</xref></sup>. For the initial library used to isolate S99T/C115S and subsequent screening efforts, the mutation rate was tuned to &#x003C;3 new mutations per gene. Over 1,000 individual clones were screened in the initial screen that identified S99T/C115S and an additional 1,500 clones were screened in a second library to identify S99T/C115S/I97V. Subsequent screens of more than 5,000 variants, including random mutations and focused libraries randomizing contacting residues, to identify additional mutations did not yield any new mutations with gains of function.</p>
<p>From transformations of &#x003E;10,000 individual colonies, individual isolates were picked into 96 well blocks and grown overnight at 37 &#x00B0;C. For induction, 4 &#x03BC;l of the overnight culture was diluted into a fresh 96 well block containing 1 mL of LB and grown for 3 hours prior to addition of 100 &#x03BC;M IPTG. The induced culture was then grown overnight at room temperature and harvested by centrifugation at 3000xg for 15 minutes. The media was decanted from the 96 well block and 125 &#x03BC;L of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1&#x0025; Triton S100) was added. The block was shaken for 30 minutes at room temperature and then frozen at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>Prior to assaying the AvrRpt2 activity, the 96 well block was thawed. To remove the membrane and unlysed cells, the thawed lysate was centrifuged at 3000xg for 15 minutes. 30 &#x03BC;L of the extract was transferred carefully to a 96 well plate. A master mix of inactive 0.25 mg/mL AvrRpt2 and 1 mM substrate peptide (Abz-IEAPAFGGWy-NH2, where y &#x003D; 3-nitro-Tyrosine) were mixed in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by mixing 10 &#x03BC;L of lysate with 30 &#x03BC;L of master mix in a Costar Black Flat bottom 96 well plate (Corning, product #3694) and measured in a Safire microplate reader monitoring fluorescence at 418 nm (excitation at 340 nm).</p></sec>

<p>S99T/C115S/I97V CypA was produced and crystallized similarly to previous studies of wild-type CypA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.

To collect the room-temperature synchrotron dataset, paratone oil was applied to cover a 2 &#x03BC;L hanging drop containing a single large crystal of S99T/C115S/I97V CypA. The crystal was harvested through the paratone and excess mother liquor was removed using a fine paper wick. Attenuated data were collected at ALS beamline 8.3.1 with a collection wavelength of 1.115 &#x00C5; at 273 K controlled by the cryojet using an ADSC Q315r detector.

<p>The clustering of k<sub>ex</sub>/p<sub>B</sub> values for this initial subset indicated a single exchange process for CypA S99T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>), and a global fit was performed after updating the initial k<sub>ex</sub>, p<sub>B</sub> and residue-specific &#x0394;&#x0277; values. As a third step, we fixed the global exchange parameters, (k<sub>ex</sub> and p<sub>B</sub>) and re-fitted all residues. Residues that had a fitted value of &#x007C;&#x0394;&#x0277;&#x007C; &#x2265; 1 ppm, an improved &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub> and consistent fitting parameters in Monte-Carlo runs (not fixing k<sub>ex</sub> and p<sub>B</sub>), were included in the list of probes experiencing exchange. Finally, a global fit and 500 Monte-Carlo runs were performed with every exchanging residue and now allowing all parameters [k<sub>ex</sub>/p<sub>B</sub> (global) and &#x0394;&#x0277;, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, DR<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>0</sub> (residue-specific)] to float. The results of this Monte-Carlo analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref> for k<sub>ex</sub>/p<sub>B</sub> and chemical shift differences are plotted on the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). Furthermore, assuming a two-state exchange model, the &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub> and fitted R<sub>2</sub> values for exchanging residues went down to their expected values, with the exception of the loop region undergoing exchange on the millisecond timescale that still exhibits high R<sub>2</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, for CypA S99T/C115S and S99T/C115S/I97V the clustering of k<sub>ex</sub>/p<sub>B</sub> values for the initial subset suggested the presence of two different processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5a</xref>). Residues that seemingly fitted well to a two-site exchange model were grouped into two clusters and separately fitted to a global process, yielding two different rates of interconversion and populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5b</xref>). In a similar manner as for CypA S99T we separately fixed the two combinations of global exchange parameters and re-fitted all data. Residues that had a fitted value of &#x007C;&#x0394;&#x0277;&#x007C; &#x2265; 1 ppm, an improved &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub> and consistent fitting parameters in Monte-Carlo runs (not fixing k<sub>ex</sub> and p<sub>B</sub>), were included in the appropriate cluster of probes experiencing exchange. The two clusters were obtained consistently even when k<sub>ex</sub>/p<sub>B</sub> values from the other one were used as starting points of the minimization. The residues present in the clusters are found in two different parts of the protein (<italic>cf.</italic> green and red spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e,g</xref>) and also have different Rex contributions in the CPMG relaxation dispersion profiles (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">2</xref>). Furthermore, CEST data for several residues, including F88 and N102, could not be fit to a two-site exchange model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5c</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these observations show that the CEST data for the double- and triple-mutant require a three-state exchange model to explain the data. We note that for some residues (<italic>cf.</italic> orange spheres in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e,g</xref>), the fast loop motion and slow processes give rise to convoluted exchange data. However, this does not automatically mean that any (or all) of these processes are correlated; it can simply be that a probe participating in one exchange process &#x201C;feels&#x201D; the fluctuating field of another, nearby exchange phenomena.</p>
<p>There are several possibilities to connect three different states (A=ground state, B=minor state 1, and C=minor state 2): one triangular model, where all states are connected, and three linear models (A&#x21D4;B&#x21D4;C, A&#x21D4;C&#x21D4;B, and B&#x21D4;A&#x21D4;C) as described earlier by Sekhar <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc57">57</xref></sup>. We did not consider the triangular model as it requires one additional fitting parameter and our NMR data is not of high enough quality to warrant this. From fitting the individual residues, we already obtained two values for k<sub>ex</sub>/population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5b</xref>) and &#x0394;&#x03C9; values, and those were used as starting values in the linear models. The combination with highest population was used as k<sub>ex,AB</sub>/p<sub>B</sub>/&#x0394;&#x03C9;<sub>AB</sub> and the other as k<sub>ex,AC</sub>/p<sub>C</sub>/&#x0394;&#x03C9;<sub>AC</sub>. The ACB-model, where the least populated minor state is the intermediate, did not fit the data; whereas the other two models gave very similar results and seem to describe the data equally well. Based on our current NMR and crystallography experiments and earlier data on CypA S99T<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, we favor the B&#x21D4;A&#x21D4;C model, where both processes are independent and this model has been used for further analysis.</p>
<p>For a number of CEST profiles, including F88 and N102, we do see two dips/asymmetry in the CEST traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5d</xref>) and can, therefore, determine the chemical shift of all three states. The CEST data for these residues could be fitted to the BAC-model, with rate constants and populations very similar obtained for the &#x201C;pure&#x201D; two-state exchange models, indicating that the observed profiles are caused by these two, independent, slow-exchange processes. For others only one dip was visible, and there we determined the best initial value for Dw&#xF020;of the second minor state by starting from the two possible options (i.e., the chemical shift of the other minor state is either close to the major state or to observable minor state) and comparing the &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub> value.</p>
<p>Finally, a global fit and 400-500 Monte-Carlo runs were performed with every exchanging residue and now allowing all parameters [kex,AB/p<sub>B</sub>; k<sub>ex,AC</sub>/p<sub>C</sub> (global) and &#x0394;&#x03C9;<sub>AB</sub>,&#x0394;&#x03C9;<sub>AC</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, &#x0394;R<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>0</sub> (residue-specific)] to float. The results of this Monte-Carlo analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5e</xref> for k<sub>ex</sub>/population and chemical shift differences are plotted on the CypA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Extended Data Figs. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">5f</xref>).

Curiously, their cis- and trans-peptide complexes show only minimal protein conformational differences compared to the starting crystal structures, while the free CypA showed multiple substates in their simulations. This is reflected in the dihedral angle distribution for Ser99 and Phe113 for apo wild-type CypA <bold>(d)</bold> versus the cis- <bold>(e)</bold> and trans- <bold>(f)</bold> substrate bound ensembles. The two alternative (major and minor) conformations seen in the room-temperature X-ray structure of wild-type CypA (PDB 3k0n) are shown in as red and orange dots for reference. Their result is in sharp contrast with our NMR dynamics for WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and S99T during catalysis measured here, which clearly shows that conformational substates interconvert across the core catalytic network and that this rate is correlated to catalysis.
