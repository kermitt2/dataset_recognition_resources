<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The mechanisms underlying spatial and temporal control of cortical neurogenesis of the brain are largely elusive. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as essential cell fate regulators. Here we found <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (also known as <italic>Kancr</italic>), a lncRNA divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter of <italic>Kdm2b</italic>, is transiently expressed during early differentiation of cortical projection neurons. Interestingly, <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcription is positively regulated <italic>in cis</italic> by <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>, which has intrinsic-activating function and facilitates a permissive chromatin environment at the <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter by associating with hnRNPAB. Lineage tracing experiments and phenotypic analyses indicated <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> are crucial in proper differentiation and migration of cortical projection neurons. Moreover, KDM2B exerts its role relying on its leucine-rich repeats (LRR) but independent of its PRC1-related function. These observations unveiled a lncRNA-dependent machinery in regulating cortical neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian cerebral cortex, also known as the neocortex, is a six-layered structure and responsible for performing the most sophisticated cognitive and perceptual functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, conscious thought and language. The adult neocortex comprises a plethora of projection neurons, interneurons and glial cells. Projection neurons (PNs) are the main functional units, expressing excitatory neurotransmitters, with their long axons projecting into subcortical regions or contralateral cortex of the brain. In mice, cortical PNs are largely generated between embryonic (E) day 11.5 to E17.5 indirectly from radial glial progenitor cells (RGPCs), whose nuclei lie in the region close to the lateral ventricles, ventricular zone (VZ). RGPCs usually divide asymmetrically to self-renew and simultaneously give rise to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), which are multipolar and reside basally to RGPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ). IPCs divide symmetrically to generate either two IPCs or two postmitotic PNs. PNs then migrate radially along the basal processes of RGPCs to propagate the cortical plate (CP) in the basal part of the cortex, which eventually forms cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). Many cellular and molecular aspects governing cortical neurogenesis have been extensively studied, including cell-autonomous and non-autonomous regulation of RGPCs&#x2019; asymmetric cell division, neuronal fate commitment, as well as PNs&#x2019; radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ayala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Imayoshi and Kageyama, 2014</xref>). However, mechanisms that control the initial numbers and proliferation rates of RGPCs, as well as the proliferative or neurogenic choices of IPCs, are largely elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Homem et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate a few long non-coding RNAs could be essential cell fate regulators in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grote et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Klattenhoff et al., 2013</xref>). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides but lacking protein-coding potentials, are abundant in brain and display cell-type-, and developmental stage-specific expression patterns compared to protein-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aprea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Belgard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mercer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>). LncRNAs may regulate gene transcription by recruiting transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins and chromatin-remodeling machineries to the site of transcription and creating a locus-specific environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). LncRNAs are often derived from bidirectional promoters, such that initiating Pol II can generate divergently-oriented transcripts simultaneously, the sense (protein-coding mRNA) direction or the upstream-antisense (divergent non-coding) direction, with these mRNA/divergent lncRNA pairs having coordinated expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lepoivre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scruggs and Adelman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sigova et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the transcription of divergent lncRNAs could affect the expression of their neighboring protein-coding transcripts <italic>in cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">&#x00F8;rom et al., 2010</xref>). Anti-sense promoters could serve as platforms for transcription factor (TF) binding and facilitate establishment of proper chromatin architecture to regulate sensestrand mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scruggs and Adelman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scruggs et al., 2015</xref>). Although divergent lncRNAs are prevalent in both embryonic and adult nervous system, only a few functional divergent lncRNAs have been characterized, including roles of <italic>Emx2OS</italic> and in regulating the expressions of their neighboring protein-coding transcripts <italic>Emx2</italic>, an essential cortical RGPC gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Noonan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Spigoni et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, these are largely in <italic>vitro</italic> studies and it&#x2019;s still lack of in <italic>vivo</italic> evidence showing the significance of divergent lncRNAs in cortical neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we characterized <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (also known as <italic>Kancr - <bold><underline>K</underline></bold>dm2b</italic> upstream-<bold><underline>a</underline></bold>ntisense <bold><underline>n</underline></bold>on-<bold><underline>c</underline></bold>oding <bold><underline>R</underline></bold>NA), a divergent lncRNA that can positively regulate the transcription of <italic>Kdm2b in cis</italic>. Both <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> are transiently expressed in committed neuronal precursors and newborn cortical PNs and essential for their proper differentiation. <italic>LncKdm2b cis</italic>-regulates <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression and facilitates a permissive chromatin environment by binding to hnRNPAB. Our findings advance understandings of molecular events that govern cortical neuronal differentiation and might have general implications in regulation of cell differentiation.</p>

<title><italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> are Transiently Expressed in Committed Neuronal Precursors and Newborn Cortical Projection Neurons</title>
<p>In an effort to identify pairs of divergent lncRNA/protein-coding transcript that exert roles in cortical neurogenesis of the mouse brain, we analyzed a database comprising both in-house and publicized transcriptome data of developing mouse cerebral cortex (dorsal forebrain). In-house data are RNA-seq data from embryonic (E) day 10.5 and E12.5 dorsal forebrain. We also included RNA-seq data of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), mESCs derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and tissues from later stages of cortical development including E14.5 ventricular zone (VZ), subventricular and intermediate zone (SVZ/IZ) and cortical plate (CP), E17.5 and adult cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayoub et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dillman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guttman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, protein-coding genes associated with divergent lncRNAs within 5 kilobase from their transcription start sites (TSS) are highly enriched for signatures including transcription, cell cycle progression and catabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A</xref>, Supplementary file 1 - Table 1), indicating their related roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ponjavic et al., 2009</xref>). One of these pairs is <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and its divergent non-coding transcript <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (also known as <italic>Kancr</italic> and <italic>A930024E05Rik)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diez-Roux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Saba et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> is transcribed at 262 base pair upstream of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS, and is predicted to be a lncRNA according to its low score in coding potential and inability to translate proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1B-1C</xref>). The expression of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> peaks in E14.5 SVZ/IZ, where IPCs and migrating PNs reside. Similarly, the expression of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> in E14.5 SVZ/IZ is slightly higher than that in E14.5 VZ and CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> is expressed at higher levels than <italic>Kdm2b</italic> in E14.5 VZ and SVZ/IZ and at comparable levels in other stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1D</xref>), which is contradictory to the common notion that divergent lncRNAs are expressed at much lower levels than their neighboring protein-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sigova et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting experiments showed expression levels of both KDM2B and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> peak in E12.5 and E14.5 dorsal forebrains, with much lower levels in E10.5 and adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1E-1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1M</xref>). This pattern is quite similar to those of <italic>Tbr2, Dcx, Unc5d</italic> and <italic>Neurodl</italic>, markers for IPCs and immature PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1G-1M</xref>). Northern blot detected a &#x007E;1.8 kb band in poly(A) RNAs extracted from E14.5 and E16.5 cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1N</xref>). Through analyzing the ENCODE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Yue et al., 2014</xref>), we found the genomic region spanning the promoter of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and its immediate upstream region that transcribes <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> is evolutionarily conserved across mammals, and is associated with Pol II (RNA polymerase II) and H3K4me3 in E14.5 mouse brain, indicating active transcription at this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) revealed that both <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> are predominantly expressed in the upper SVZ of the E16.5 dorsal forebrain, with the apical side of ISH signals overlapping with TBR2, an SVZ marker labeling intermediate cortical neural precursors (IPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, S1O-S1P); and basal side overlapping with TUJ1, a marker for fate-determined pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1P</xref>). These data suggest both <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> are transiently expressed in committed IPCs and freshly differentiated projection neurons during the peak of cortical neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Kdm2b-expressing Cortical Cells are Fated to be Cortical Projection Neurons</title>
<p>To further validate <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression and the fate of <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-expressing cells during cortical neurogenesis, we generated a knock-in mouse line, <italic>Kdm2b-F2a-CreERT2-IRES-EGFP</italic> (referred to <italic>Kdm2b<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>), in which the <italic>F2a-CreERT2-IRES-EGFP</italic> cassette was inserted in frame into the third exon of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Southern blotting and genomic PCR validated the predicted genomic modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1Q</xref>). Expressions of CreERT2 and EGFP are driven by the endogenous <italic>Kdm2b</italic> promoter, which would allow us to perform detailed expression analyses and lineage tracing experiments for <italic>Kdm2b</italic>. Brain sections from embryos derived from mating of <italic>Kdm2b<sup>CreERT2/&#x002B;</sup></italic> with wild-type (WT) C57/B6 were subjected to immunofluorescent staining. Consistent with ISH experiments, EGFP&#x002B; cells reside in upper SVZ and lower intermediate zone (IZ), overlapping with both TBR2&#x002B; IPCs and TUJ1&#x002B; projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, S1R). Moreover, a large portion of EGFP&#x002B; cells also overlap with UNC5D, a marker for multipolar cells in embryonic SVZ/IZ and layer IV projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1S</xref>). Notably, EGFP&#x002B; signals extend more basally than <italic>Kdm2b</italic> or <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> ISH signaling, probably because EGFP protein is more stable than transcripts of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> or <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>. We next bred <italic>Kdm2b<sup>CreERT2/&#x002B;</sup></italic> with the <italic>Ai14 (Rosa-CAG-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato-WPRE)</italic> reporter mice. Pregnant female mice were injected with tamoxifen at various stages to enable the excision of the STOP cassette, thus leading to tdTomato expression in the progenies of <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-expressing cells. Cortices were collected from E16.5 and newborn (P0) pups for immunofluorescent staining of SATB2 (a marker for layer 2-4 callosal neurons) and CTIP2 (a marker for layer 5 subcortical neurons). Interestingly, most tdTomato-positive cells express either SATB2 (51.0 &#x00B1; 2.5&#x0025; at E16.5, 63.1 &#x00B1; 2.5&#x0025; at P0) or CTIP2 (20.7 &#x00B1; 5.4&#x0025; at E16.5, 7.0 &#x00B1; 2.3&#x0025; at P0), suggesting the progenies of <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-expressing cells are largely projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A-2D</xref>). Of note, the Cre recombinase could be randomly activated in neural epithelial (NE) cells of <italic>Kdm2b<sup>CreERT2/&#x002B;</sup>;Ai14</italic> mice in the absence of tamoxifen, thus confounding the analysis of lineage-tracing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2E-2F</xref>). Nonetheless, by P7, tdTomato-positive cells largely express SATB2 (63.6 &#x00B1; 4.8&#x0025;) and/or CTIP2 (44.3 &#x00B1; 5.8&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1 - figure supplement 2G-2H</xref>). To overcome the issue, we electroporated the LoxP-STOP-LoxP-DsRed (pCALNL) reporter plasmid into the E12.5 <italic>Kdm2b<sup>CreERT2/&#x002B;</sup></italic> cortices followed by tamoxifen injection six hours after electroporation. In line with genetic lineage-tracing data, the majority DsRed-positive cells express either SATB2 (71.9&#x0025; &#x00B1; 1.5&#x0025;) or CTIP2 (18.2&#x0025; &#x00B1; 7.1&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The above expression and lineage-tracing results suggest <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> are transiently expressed in differentiating IPCs and freshly born PNs and might regulate neuronal differentiation during cortical neurogenesis.</p>

<title><italic>LncKdm2b</italic> Regulates <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> Expression <italic>in cis</italic></title>
<p>The close proximity of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>&#x2019;s TSS and their identical expression patterns in developing cortices prompted us to examine if <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> regulates <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression. Since it&#x2019;s impractical to maintain intermediate progenitor cells or immature projection neurons in <italic>vitro</italic>, we utilized a few primary or immortalized cells that express both <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> to address the issue. First, we transduced Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells with <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which mediate RNA degradation <italic>via</italic> the RNase H-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Vickers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Walder and Walder, 1988</xref>). The levels of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcripts and protein were significantly decreased upon the ASO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-2B</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> by ASO or shRNAs in adherent cultured cortical cells leads to decreased <italic>Kdm2b</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A-1B</xref>). Next, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to delete the genomic region of <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> second exon in NE-4C mouse neural stem cells (<italic>LncKdm2b<sup>exon2-KO</sup></italic>), which results in compromised expression of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, there&#x2019;re significant amounts of transcripts derived from <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> first and third exons in LncKdm2b<sup>exon2-KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the expression levels of <italic>Zfp292</italic>, the downstream target of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> in ILC3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), were not decreased upon <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> depletion, suggesting a cell-type-specific effects by <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1E</xref>).

<p>Cross-talk among neighboring genes could involve <italic>trans-</italic> and/or <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms, the latter including enhancer-like activity of gene promoters, the process of transcription, and the splicing of the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bassett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Engreitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). To discriminate these possibilities, four polyadenylation sequences (pAS) were inserted 1.8 kb downstream of <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS to prematurely terminate its transcription in one allele of mouse C57/B6 embryonic stem cells (<italic>mESC</italic><sup><italic>LncKdm2b-pAS/&#x002B;</italic></sup>), but to keep undisturbed the essential promoter region for <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>&#x2019;s transcription, which is DNase I hypersensitive (HS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistently, the expressions of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> were significantly decreased upon pAS insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcription process and/or transcripts themselves are required for <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression. We next studied if <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> maintains <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcription <italic>in cis</italic>. First, subcellular fractionation followed by RT-qPCR and RNA ISH assays revealed that most <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> resides in the cytosol with a fraction in the nuclei of cortical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1F-1G</xref>). Next, we genetically modified <italic>mESC<sup>LncKdm2b-pAS/</sup>&#x002B;</italic> cells so that indels were created in the second exon of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> in an allele-specific manner. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments of the two clones (1B1 and 2D5) showed it&#x2019;s the allele with pAS insertion has significantly lower <italic>Kdm2b</italic> transcription than the other allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Lastly, nuclear extracts from <italic>LncKdm2b-depleted</italic> Neuro-2a cells were collected and subjected to nuclear run-on assay. Data showed depletion of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> results in significantly lower yield of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

<title><italic>LncKdm2b</italic> Modulates the Configuration of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> C/s-regulatory elements</title>
<p>Specific gene expression is coordinated by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements such as the promoter/enhancer, cell-type-specific transcription factors and chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Heintzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Perino and Veenstra, 2016</xref>). To understand these mechanisms underlying <italic>Kdm2b</italic> transcription, we first analyzed the genomic region both upstream and downstream of the <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS. This genome region contains multiple active and/or repressive epigenetic modifications including DNase I HS, H3K27ac (indicative of active enhancers), H3K4me1 (active or poised enhancers), H3K27me3 (repressive or poised <italic>cis</italic>-elements), and CTCF-association (insulators) in developing mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vierstra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Yue et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting it may contain putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (enhancers) for <italic>Kdm2b</italic> (T1 to T7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since <italic><italic>cis</italic>-</italic> regulatory elements/enhancers can be recruited spatially adjacent to promoters to control gene expression, we performed the chromosome conformation capture (3C) followed by qPCR experiments and identified a peak of high crosslinking frequency at the H3K4me1-enriched T5 locus (5.9 kb upstream of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS) when using a constant EcoR I fragment located close to the <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating the T5 locus is significantly associated with <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter. Interestingly, depletion of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> significantly attenuated the association between T5 and <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS, suggesting transcribed <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> maintains <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression by inducing a local 3D chromatin structure to bring close <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> enhancer and promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, luciferase (Luc) assays revealed that the 1.67 kb-long DNA fragment containing the T5 locus has strong enhancer/promoter activities in Neuro-2a cells when it was reversely placed (opposite of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcription direction) at 5&#x2019; of the firefly Luc cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We further narrowed the T5 locus to an evolutionarily conserved 484 bp-long region (T5-mini) and revealed this fragment can also significantly drive Luc expression if reversely placed at 5&#x2019; of the firefly Luc cassette. In line with the T5 locus being an evolutionarily conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element, both mouse T5 and T5-mini sequences are able to drive reporter gene expression in human HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate if the genomic region embedded with the T5 element is sufficient to initiate spatiotemporal transcription in cortices, we cloned a piece of 8.0 kb genomic DNA (<italic>KUS</italic> &#x2013; <italic>Kdm2b</italic> upstream sequence, &#x2212;0.6 kb to &#x002B;7.3 kb relative to <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS) from the mouse genome. <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation assay revealed that this genomic region alone can efficiently drive the expression of short-lived d2EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999</xref>) in embryonic cortices at either orientation with a pattern reminiscent of endogenous <italic>Kdm2b</italic> or <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, we found the T5 region is essential for <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression, as genomic deletion of T5 leads to compromised <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression in NE-4C cells and in cortical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1B-1D</xref>). Together, these data indicate the <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> upstream region contains evolutionarily conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements essential for expression of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>, and its configuration is modulated by <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>LncKdm2b</italic> Facilitates a Permissive Chromatin Environment for <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> Expression by Associating with hnRNPAB</title>
<p>In order to test whether <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> displays intrinsic ability to promote gene expression, we used the Gal4-&#x03BB;N/BoxB system to tether this lncRNA to a heterologous reporter promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Trimarchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>). The data showed the full-length <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and its evolutionarily conserved 5&#x2019; part (1-908 nt, transcribed from <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> gene&#x2019;s first and second exons) could enhance luciferase activities in a dosage-dependent manner, whereas its less conserved 3&#x2019; part (909-1896 nt) couldn&#x2019;t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1B-1D</xref>). Therefore, the 5&#x2019; conserved part of <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcript bears intrinsic-activating function. <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> intrinsic-activating capability could be due to its association with <italic>trans</italic>-factor(s). We carried out RNA pull-down experiments using biotinylated <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> and <italic>antisense-LncKdm2b</italic> RNAs. RNA pull-down assay was performed using nuclear protein extracts from cortical NPCs followed by mass spectrometry (MS). A number of RNA binding proteins were enriched in <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>-precipitating extracts compared to those precipitated by antisense <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (Supplementary file 1 - Table 2). One of the most enriched protein is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (hnRNPAB), which is validated by RNA pull-down followed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-4B</xref>). Notably, SATB1, the protein partner of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), was not identified to be associated with <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> in this study, probably due to cellular specificity. HnRNPAB is dynamically expressed during brain development and has implications in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sinnamon et al., 2012</xref>). Depletion of <italic>Hnrnpab</italic> in Neuro-2a cells significantly decreased <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1E</xref>).

<p>In line with the fact that the 5&#x2019; conserved part of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> has intrinsic-activating function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1B-1D</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments indicated the two 5&#x2019; conserved regions (1-454 nt and 455-905 nt) of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> could interact with hnRNPAB, with the 455-905 nt region having stronger association with hnRNPAB than the 1-454 nt region.

Moreover, restoration of the P1 hairpin (P1 rescue) would partially rescue the association, but the P2 hairpin or the stem-loop 2 (840-918 nt) is not required for the association of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> with hnRNPAB. The EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) experiment further validated the binding of <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> stem-loop 1 region (463-625nt) to hnRNPAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Together, these analyses revealed that the hairpin P1 of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>&#x2019;s conserved 5&#x2019; part directly interacts with hnRNPAB, which might be responsible for <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> intrinsic-activating function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1B-1D</xref>).</p>
<p>HnRNPAB, also known as CArG box-binding factor-A (CBF-A), is an RNA binding protein with transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Venkov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). We went on to ask if hnRNPAB binds to genomic regions essential for <italic>Kdm2b</italic> expression, and if the binding is regulated by <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>. ChlP-qPCR showed hnRNPAB binds to multiples sites in the <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter and the T5 region, many of which were positively regulated by <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-4L</xref>). The reporter activity driven by <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter (<italic>pKdm2b)</italic> is mediated by the hnRNPAB-binding CArG box. Downregulating hnRNPAB would significantly lower <italic>pKdm2bs</italic> reporter activity, whereas exert no effect on CArG box-deleted <italic>pKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Moreover, the association between the T5 and <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS was significantly compromised upon hnRNPAB depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Finally, the <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter (&#x2212;78 bp to &#x2212;20 bp relative to <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS) was less enriched for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, two histone markers indicative of active transcription, in <italic>LncKdm2b-depleted</italic> Neuro-2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O-4P</xref>). Collectively, <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression correlates positively with the association between <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter and an essential enhancer (T5), which is facilitated by <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcripts and its associated protein hnRNPAB. These findings point a role of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> in regulating transcription locally.</p>

<title>KDM2B Promotes Cortical Neuronal Differentiation</title>
<p>Since <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> regulates the expression of <italic>Kdm2b</italic>, and <italic>Kdm2b</italic> is transiently expressed in freshly born projection neurons, we next explored roles and mechanisms of KDM2B in cortical neurogenesis. We first electroporated E13.5 embryonic cortices with plasmids overexpressing <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and collected brains at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). Significantly more <italic>Kdm2b</italic> transduced cells reside in the cortical plate (CP, future cortices) with fewer cells in the VZ/SVZ, indicating accelerated cortical neurogenesis and radially neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-5B</xref>). In line with this, fewer mCherry&#x002B; <italic>Kdm2b</italic> transduced cells express TBR2 and PAX6, markers for IPCs and RGPCs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-5E</xref>). Embryonic brains of <italic>Kdm2b<sup>CreERT2/CreERT2</sup></italic> mice have significant amount of residual KDM2B protein probably due to inefficient transcriptional termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5 - figure supplement 1B</xref>), which might lead to subsequent use of alternative start codons. We therefore performed <italic>Kdm2b</italic> loss-of-function studies by electroporating plasmids expressing short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against <italic>Kdm2b</italic> into E13.5 embryonic cortices. To minimize nonspecific effects, we chose the shmiRNA system to express long RNA hairpins with shRNAs embedded into endogenous miRNA loop and flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). Significant more <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-shRNA electroporated cells reside in the VZ/SVZ at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F-5G</xref>). Next, E16.5 <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-shRNA transduced cortices were immuno-stained with TBR2 and NEUROD2, a transcriptional factor expressed in cortical PNs. Results showed more transduced cells are co-labeled with TBR2 but fewer cells express NEUROD2, with significantly more NEUROD2&#x002B; transduced cells localized in the VZ/SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5 - figure supplement 1C-1D</xref>). Moreover, more transduced cells are colocalized with PAX6-positive RGPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J-5K</xref>). This phenotype can be fully rescued by simultaneously overexpressing <italic>Kdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F-5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure 5 - figure supplement 1E-1F</xref>).

<title>KDM2B Depends on its Leucine-rich Repeats to Promote Cortical Neuronal Differentiation</title>
<p>KDM2B contains multiple functional domains, including the JmjC histone demethylase domain, a DNA-binding CxxC zinc finger, an F-box domain, a PHD finger, and eight leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The F-box and the LRR domain are required for variant polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) recruitment and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Inagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). To decipher how KDM2B exerts its function in cortical development, we carried out rescue experiments using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-6D</xref>).

Intriguingly, expressing KDM2B with JmjC mutation (lacking methyl-transferase activity), PHD mutation; CxxC, or F-box deletion individually could fully rescue hampered radial migration (judged by relative positions of transduced cells) and enhanced RGPCs self-renewal (determined by PAX6&#x002B; transduced cells) caused by <italic>Kdm2b</italic> depletion, whereas the LRR-deleted KDM2B (KDM2B-&#x0394;LRR) could not rescue the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-6D</xref>). Moreover, overexpressing the <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-&#x0394;LRR alone also leads to delayed neuronal differentiation and radial migration, and enhanced self-renewal of RGPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-6G</xref>), suggesting the LRR domain is indispensable for KDM2B&#x2019;s role in promoting cortical neuronal differentiation and <italic>Kdm2b</italic>-&#x0394;LRR overexpression caused a dominant-negative effect (Supplementary file 1 - Table 3).</p>

<p>It has been reported that the LRR domain is essential for KDM2B to recruit and assemble the PRC1; and depletion of RING1B, the catalytic component of PRC1, in mice leads to prolonged neurogenic phase of NPCs and delaying of the onset of the astrogenic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirabayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Morimoto-Suzki et al., 2014</xref>). To study if KDM2B relies on PRC1 to exert its role, we electroporated plasmids expressing catalytic inactive RING1B (I53A) into the E13.5 cortices. Although this mutation ablates RING1B&#x2019;s ability to act as an E3 ligase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>), it does not perturb the incorporation of RING1B into canonical and variant PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Illingworth et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, the neurogenic process is unaltered by E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1B-1E</xref>). Moreover, whole-body inactivation of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> in mice doesn&#x2019;t lead to reduction of H2AK119Ub1, a histone modification mediated by PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1F-1G</xref>). These results indicate the pro-neurogenic roles exerted by KDM2B is independent of its function in mediating PRC1 activities.</p>

<p>Next, we explored whether <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> regulates cortical neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> through <italic>Kdm2b</italic>. E13.5 embryonic cortices were electroporated with siRNAs or antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting <italic>Kdm2b</italic> or <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> respectively followed by phenotypic analyses at E16.5. Significantly fewer siKdm2b&#x2010; or <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> ASO-transduced cells reside in the CP with more cells in the VZ/SVZ, indicating delayed neuronal differentiation. In line with this, more transduced cells express PAX6. Most importantly, overexpressing <italic>Kdm2b</italic> can mostly rescue the phenotypes caused by <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H-7J</xref>). Finally, we ask if hnRNPAB, the <italic>LncKdm2b-</italic> associated protein, also regulates neuronal differentiation in developing neocortex. To this end, we electroporated E13.5 cortices with siRNAs against <italic>Hnrnpab</italic> and indeed found <italic>Hnrnpab-depleted</italic> cells showed delayed neuronal migration to the CP at E16.5 and hampered differentiation of NSPCs - more sihnRNPAB-transduced cells localized in the VZ/SVZ and co-localized with PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K-7M</xref>). On the other hand, depletion of <italic>Hnrnpa2b1</italic> didn&#x2019;t cause such defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 7 - figure supplement 1A-1C</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> has no effect on neuronal migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure 7 - figure supplement 1D-1E</xref>), which is in line with aforementioned data showing <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> couldn&#x2019;t trans-activate <italic>Kdm2b</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1H</xref>).

<p>In summary, we found the precise balance of self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of NSPCs during cortical neurogenesis is modulated by KDM2B in the LRR-dependent manner. Moreover, the expression of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> is positively regulated by its divergent lncRNA <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>, which facilitates a permissive chromatin configuration locally by bringing together the upstream regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-element T5, <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter and hnRNPAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>).</p>

<p>The generation of layer-specific PNs over developmental time is precisely controlled and largely attributed to cell-intrinsic properties of NSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gaspard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Shen et al., 2006</xref>).

Here we found lncRNA gene <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> shares the same promoter with its bidirectional protein-coding gene <italic>Kdm2b</italic>, and both of them are transiently expressed in committed IPCs and freshly-born PNs. Unlike most bidirectional coding-noncoding transcripts, <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression level is comparable with that of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> at the peak of cortical neurogenesis, strongly indicating <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> regulatory roles. Indeed, <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> maintains <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression <italic>in cis</italic> in neural cells. Mechanistically, the <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> transcripts enhances physical association of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter and a key enhancer T5 <italic>via</italic> binding to hnRNPAB. <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcript, especially its evolutionarily conserved 5&#x2019; part, bears intrinsic-activating function and interacts with hnRNPAB <italic>via</italic> one of its putative stem-loop structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-4H</xref>, S4A-S4D). Similarly, a 5&#x2019; fragment of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (450&#x2013;700 nt) is necessary for its binding to SATB1 or SRCAP in ILC3 and ES cells respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). HnRNPAB, an RNA binding protein with transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Venkov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), was shown to be associated with <italic>Kdm2bs</italic> TSS and the T5 region in neural cells, and the strength of the association depends on the presence of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K-4L</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>cis</italic>-activity of <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter also relies on hnRNPAB&#x2019;s binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). The core T5-region (T5-mini), a conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element embedded in <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> second intron, can drive gene expression in both mouse and human cells when reversely placed upstream of reporters, and its deletion results in decreased expression of <italic>Kdm2b</italic>. In summary, this study indicates a role of LncRNA in coordinating the association of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (<italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> TSS and T5) and <italic>trans</italic>-factor(s) (hnRNPAB) in transcriptional regulation, which probably relies on RNA&#x2019;s specific secondary structures.</p>
<p>A recent study by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. showed <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> activates expression of <italic>Zfp292 in trans via</italic> recruiting the chromatin organizer SATB1 and the nuclear remodeling factor (NURF) complex onto the <italic>Zfp292</italic> promoter in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> activates the expression of <italic>Zbtb3</italic> by promoting the assembly and ATPase activity of the SRCAP complex in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, these studies didn&#x2019;t detect expression alterations of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> in <italic>LncKdm2b-null</italic> ILC3s and mESCs. In our study, <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> was not found to be associated with SATB1. Furthermore, the expression levels of <italic>Zfp292</italic> were not decreased in neural cells depleted with <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1C-1E</xref>). These discrepancies could be due to different cellular context and/or distinct inactivation approaches. <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> second exon was deleted in previous studies to abolish its transcripts, which might not hamper <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcription process <italic>per se</italic> and/or <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> conserved region with intrinsic-activating function could still exist. In fact, a good fraction of <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> transcripts derived from the first and third exons could be detected in NE-4C cells with <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> second exon deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, our study also used siRNAs and ASOs to target <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>, and inserted pAS sites into <italic>LncKdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> first intron in mESCs, thus impeding <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> transcription, ultimately leading to attenuation of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-2G</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> controls <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression at the transcriptional level in cell nuclei, a good fraction of <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> transcripts resides in the cytoplasm. Previous studies also indicated <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> localizes in both nuclei and cytosol in mESCs and innate lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). It remains to be elucidated if <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> functions in cytosol, and if <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>&#x2019;s cytosolic translocation would facilitate its decay to ensure <italic>Kdm2b</italic>&#x2019;s transient expression during neuronal differentiation. This finding is just the beginning to understand how LncRNAs regulate cortical neuronal differentiation by controlling local transcription and might have general implications in cell fate determinations.</p>
<p>KDM2B, also known as JHDM1B, NDY1 and FBXL10, was initially characterized as a Jumonji (JmjC) domain containing histone H3K36 di-demethylase. KDM2B is a multidomain protein that is localized to essentially all CpG-rich promoters <italic>via</italic> its CxxC domain that binds to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. KDM2B is also a constituent of a non-canonical (variant) polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), and KDM2B&#x2019;s leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and the F-box domain are essential for KDM2B to recruit/assemble the PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Boulard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Inagaki et al., 2015</xref>). KDM2B plays pivotal roles in cell senescence and proliferation, DNA repair, embryogenesis, oncogenesis, and somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andricovich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kottakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wang et al., 2011b</xref>). We found KDM2B relies on its LRR domain but not the F-box to regulate neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Leucine-rich repeats are frequently involved in mediating protein&#x2013;protein interactions, but most of human LRR-containing proteins remain functionally uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ng and Xavier, 2011</xref>). In addition, the E3 ligase activity of RING1B, PRC1&#x2019;s core component, seems dispensable for cortical neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1C-1E</xref>), which is in line with findings showing the enzymatic capabilities of RING1B is dispensable for early mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Illingworth et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, inactivation of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> in mice doesn&#x2019;t result in reduction of H2AK119Ub1, a histone modification mediated by PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1F-1G</xref>), suggesting KDM2B relies on signals other than PRC1 to promote neuronal differentiation. The deletion or mutation of JmjC, CxxC, PHD domains individually could rescue hampered neuronal differentiation caused by <italic>Kdm2b</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-6D</xref>), but these domains may still exert scaffold or adaptor roles.</p>
<p>It will be also worthy of exploring how the transient expressions of <italic>Kdm2b</italic> and <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> are initiated and maintained in cortical IPCs and freshly-born PNs. A report showed KDM2B&#x2019;s expression in primary MEFs and cancer cells is induced by FGF-2 via CREB phosphorylation and activation, downstream of DYRK1A kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kottakis et al., 2011</xref>). Since both FGF-2 and DYRK1A have essential roles in cortical development, it remains to be studied if they regulate <italic>KDM2B&#x2019;s</italic> expression in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fotaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ghosh and Greenberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Vescovi et al., 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, we italic <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> novel function in promoting neuronal differentiation, which is PRC1 independent. Moreover, <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> expression is maintained by its divergent lncRNA <italic>LncKdm2b</italic>, which mediates a permissive chromatin environment around <italic>Kdm2b&#x2019;s</italic> promoter. Since normal cortical development is key to neurological functions such as cognition, KDM2B may have implications in neuropsychiatric disorders. In line with this, <italic>KDM2B</italic> is among the most frequently deleted genes in the 12q24.31 microdeletion syndrome, which is characterized by principal clinical features including autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and craniofacial anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Labonne et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, human <italic>LncKDM2B</italic> is also transcribed divergently from the promoter of <italic>KDM2B</italic> with high sequence homology with <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). It remains to be investigated if <italic>LncKDM2B&#x2019;s cis</italic>-regulating roles and KDM2B&#x2019;s function in promoting neuronal differentiation are conserved in human.</p>

<title>RNA-seq Transcriptome Analysis</title>
<p>Dorsal forebrain (cortex) tissues were resected from E10.5 or E12.5 mouse embryos under dissecting microscopes. Total RNAs were extracted twice using Trizol (Thermo Fisher) and were treated with DNase I (NEB Biolabs). The integrity of RNAs was analyzed using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Removal of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and construction of libraries for standard strand-specific RNA-seq were performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000 in BGI Tech. Quality control reads alignment, and gene-expression analysis were also carried out in BGI Tech. Some low-quality RNA reads were present in original data. Thus, four kinds of reads were removed before mapping to the mouse genome. 1) Adaptor sequences; 2) Poor quality reads that Q5 or less mass value bases account for more than 50&#x0025; of the entire reads; 3) Reads that have a proportion of &#x201C;N&#x201D; greater than 10&#x0025;. 4) Reads that align with mouse rRNA.

To make Dig-labeled <italic>LncKdm2b</italic> truncations and loop1 mutations, the 5&#x2019;-overhang of forward PCR primer was modified with a T7 promoter (See Supplementary file 1 - Table 4 for the primers used in RNA pulldown probes). Digoxigenin labeled riboprobes were transcribed using the DIG-RNA Labeling Mix (Roche). 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> HEK293T cells (Two 10-cm dishes) expressing Flag-hnRNPAB were harvested and resuspended in 1 mL lysis buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x0025; NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 mM RVC, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] followed by sonication on ice. After centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C, the supernatant was incubated with 50 &#x03BC;L anti-Flag agarose beads (Biotool). After immunoprecipitation and washing 4 &#x00D7; 5 minutes with TBS buffer, one fifth beads was saved for immunoblotting. The rest was equilibrated in binding buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x0025; NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM RVC, protease inhibitor cocktail (Biotool)] and incubated with 300 ng Dig-labeled RNA (Dig-labeled RNAs were annealed by heating at 65&#x00B0;C for 5 minutes followed with slowly cooling down to room temperature) for at 4&#x00B0;C for 4 hours. After washing 4 &#x00D7; 5 minutes with binding buffer, the bound RNA was extracted with Trizol and analyzed by Northern blotting.</p>

<title>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)</title>
<p>For RNA EMSAs, digoxigenin labeled riboprobes (<italic>LncKdm2b</italic> loop1, 463-625 nt) were transcribed using the DIG-RNA Labeling Mix (Roche). EMSA experiments were conducted according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol with a Light Shift Chemiluminescent RNA EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific). The Dig-labeled RNAs were annealed by heating at 65&#x00B0;C for 5 minutes followed with slowly cooling down to room temperature. One fmol labeled RNAs were used for each EMSA reaction. For detection of dose-dependent binding of protein to RNA, different doses of Flag-hnRNPAB (1 &#x03BC;g, 3 &#x03BC;g or 10 &#x03BC;g) were used. Unlabeled probe was used for competitive reaction. Binding reactions were incubated in binding buffer [10 mM HEPES pH7.5, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT] at room temperature for 25 minutes, then immediately loaded onto a 2&#x0025; nondenaturing agarose 0.5 &#x00D7; TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane, labeled probes were cross-linked by UV, probed with Anti-Digoxigenin-AP antibody, and incubated with detection substrates.</p>

<title>Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)</title>
<p>Total RNAs (0.5 - 1 &#x03BC;g) were reverse-transcribed at 42&#x00B0;C using PrimerScript&#x2122; Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Bio). Then iTaq<sup>TM</sup> Universal SYBR<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Green Supermix (Bio-rad) was employed to perform quantitative PCR on a CFX Connect&#x2122; Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-rad). Gene expressions were determined using the 2<sup>-&#x0394;&#x0394;Ct</sup> method, normalizing to housekeeping genes <italic>Gapdh</italic>. See Supplementary file 1 - Table 4 for qPCR primers.</p>

<title><italic>In Utero</italic> Electroporation of Developing Cerebral Cortices</title>
<p><italic>In utero</italic> microinjection and electroporation were performed essentially at E13.5 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Li et al., 2017b</xref>). In brief, pregnant CD-1 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (70 mg/kg). The uteri were exposed through a 2 cm midline abdominal incision. Embryos were carefully pulled out using ring forceps through the incision and placed on sterile and irrigated drape. Intermittently wet uterine walls with saline to prevent drying. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (prepared using Endo Free plasmid purification kit, Tiangen) mixed with 0.05&#x0025; Fast Green (Sigma) was injected through the uterine wall into the telencephalic vesicle of 3-4 embryos at intervals using pulled borosilicate needles (WPI). Electric pulses (36 V, 50 ms duration at 1 s intervals for 5 times) were generated using CUY21VIVO-SQ (BEX) and delivered across the uterine wall using 5 mm forceps-like electrodes (BEX). The uteri were then carefully put back into the abdominal cavity and incisions were sutured. The whole procedure was completed within 30 minutes. Mice were warmed on a heating pad until they woke up and given analgesia treatment (Ibuprofen) in drinking water until sacrifice.</p>

<title>Primary Culture of Embryonic Cortical Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs)</title>
<p>Primary culture of embryonic cortical NPCs was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Li et al., 2017b</xref>). In brief, E11.5 or E12.5 mouse cortices (dorsal forebrain) tissues were washed with and minced in filter-sterilized hibernation buffer (30 mM KCl; 5 mM NaOH; 5 mM NaH2PO4; 5.5 mM glucose; 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 20 mM Na-pyruvate; 200 mM Sorbitol, pH 7.4) followed by dissociating into single cells using pre-warmed Papain (Worthington Biochemical) enzyme solution (1 &#x00D7; DMEM; 1 mM Na-pyruvate; 1 mM L-Glutamine; 1 mM N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine; 20 U/mL Papain; 12 &#x03BC;g/mL DNase I). Dissociated cells were cultured using serum-free media consisting of DMEM/F12 media (Life Technologies), N2 and B27 supplements (1 &#x00D7;, Life Technologies), 1mM Na-pyruvate, 1 mM N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC), human recombinant FGF2 and EGF (20 ng/mL each; Life Technologies). For adherent cortical cultures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and S3A-S3B, cells were maintained on poly-L-lysine coated plates with the presence of 20 ng/mL FGF2 for 24 hours followed by differentiation (FGF2 withdrawal) for 48 hours. For sphere culture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, cells were cultured with the presence of EGF and FGF2 for 1 week. For clonal culture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-7G</xref>, cells were maintained 72 hours with the presence of 20 ng/mL FGF2 for 72 hours (4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in 24-well plates).</p>
