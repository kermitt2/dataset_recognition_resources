<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Parkinson&#x2019;s disease factors, PINK1 and parkin, are strongly implicated in stress-induced mitophagy in vitro, but little is known about their impact on basal mitophagy <italic>in vivo</italic>. We generated transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> expressing fluorescent mitophagy reporters to evaluate the impact of <italic>Pink1/parkin</italic> mutations on basal mitophagy under physiological conditions. We find that mitophagy is readily detectable and abundant in many tissues including Parkinson&#x2019;s disease relevant dopaminergic neurons. However, we did not detect mitolysosomes in flight muscle. Surprisingly, in <italic>Pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> null flies we did not observe any substantial impact on basal mitophagy. As these flies exhibit locomotor defects and dopaminergic neuron loss, our findings raise questions about current assumptions of the pathogenic mechanism associated with the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Our findings provide evidence that Pink1 and parkin are not essential for bulk basal mitophagy in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They also emphasize that mechanisms underpinning basal mitophagy remain largely obscure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria are essential organelles that perform many critical metabolic functions but are also a major source of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and harbor pro-apoptotic factors. Multiple homeostatic processes operate to maintain mitochondrial integrity, however, terminally damaged organelles are degraded through the process of targeted mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) to prevent potentially catastrophic consequences. Such homeostatic mechanisms are particularly important for post-mitotic, energetically demanding tissues such as nerves and muscles. Two proteins linked to Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (PD), Parkin, a cytosolic ubiquitin E3 ligase, and PINK1, a mitochondrially targeted kinase, have been shown to play key roles in mitophagy.</p>
<p>PINK1-Parkin mediated mitophagy has been intensively investigated and many of the molecular mechanisms have been elucidated (reviewed in (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, upon loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as occurs in damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and initiates the mitophagy signal by phosphorylating both ubiquitin and Parkin, which promotes its activity depositing more ubiquitin for subsequent phosphorylation. This process acts as a feedforward mechanism ultimately decorating the OMM with phospho-ubiquitin chains that are then recognized by ubiquitin adaptor proteins leading to the engulfment of the depolarized mitochondria by autophagosomes.</p>
<p>As a pathogenic mechanism, failure in mitophagy offers an attractive explanation for multiple, long standing observations that implicate mitochondrial defects in the pathogenicity of PD, such as systemic mitochondrial complex I deficits and high levels of mtDNA mutations in PD patients (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Exner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Kraytsberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Schapira et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, the unique physiological characteristics of <italic>substantia nigra</italic> neurons, such as their extensive arborization, myriad synaptic connections and continuous pacemaking activity, place an extreme demand on mitochondrial function to meet their high energy demand and calcium buffering requirements, which may explain the selective vulnerability of these neurons to loss of mitochondrial integrity (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Sulzer and Surmeier, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of the molecular details of PINK1/Parkin-induced mitophagy have been elaborated in cultured cells that over-express Parkin following acute mitochondrial depolarization or toxification (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>). However, relatively little is known about mitophagy under physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Cummins and Gotz, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Rodger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Whitworth and Pallanck, 2017</xref>). One of the limitations to studying mitophagy <italic>in vivo</italic> has been the paucity of suitable reporters. Recently, two <italic>in vivo</italic> mitophagy reporter models have been described in mice (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">McWilliams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). One uses a mitochondrial matrix-targeted pH-sensitive variant of GFP (mt-Keima) while the other uses a tandem GFP-mCherry fusion protein targeted to the OMM (called &#x201C;mito-QC&#x201D;). Both systems exploit pH-sensitive properties of mKeima and GFP respectively to enable the differential labelling of mitochondria in the acidic microenvironment of the lysosome as a proxy end-point readout. Initial reports on these two reporter lines have revealed a surprisingly widespread and heterogeneous distribution of basal mitophagy, however, the involvement of PINK1 and Parkin has not been addressed yet.</p>
<p>We have generated <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines expressing these mitophagy reporters to provide the first global view of the prevalence of mitophagy across the organism and to determine the relative contribution of Pink1 and parkin to basal mitophagy. Analyzing mitophagy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers a valuable opportunity to interrogate the physiological requirement of Pink1-Parkin in this process <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast to mammalian models, loss of <italic>Drosophila Pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> leads to robust phenotypes in locomotor activity and dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>), indicating their critical function in the related neuromuscular tissues. We find that while basal mitophagy is widespread in many tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the incidence of mitolysosomes, and hence, basal mitophagy, is unaffected by loss of Pink1 or parkin. Moreover, flight muscle, which shows the most robust disruption upon <italic>Pink1/parkin</italic> mutation (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>), does not reveal a detectable mitophagy signal. Hence, we propose that Pink1 and parkin are largely dispensable for basal mitophagy have mitophagy-independent functions in neuromuscular tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<title>Validation of mitophagy reporters in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>We first generated GAL4/UAS-inducible transgenic lines to express either mito-QC or mt-Keima. Multiple lines were established and immunoblotting confirmed comparable expression between lines (Figure S1A-B). Expression of these reporters in all lines appeared benign and did not noticeably affect development or viability. To ensure that the expression of these reporters did not overtly interfere with normal cellular functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly in the sensitive neuromuscular systems of interest here, we analyzed locomotor activity in flies expressing high levels of the mito-QC or mt-Keima in all tissues and observed no significant impact (Figure S1C-F).</p>
<p>Previous work has demonstrated the appropriate targeting of mito-QC and mt-Keima to mitochondria <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that &#x2018;spectral shifted&#x2019; puncta of more acidic conditions indeed co-localized with lysosomes. Nevertheless, we also sought to verify these conditions in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines. As expected, we observed substantial co-localization of mito-QC and mt-Keima with the mitochondrial protein ATP5A in two tissues highly amenable for mitochondrial imaging analysis, larval epidermal cells and adult flight muscle (Figure S2A-C). The &#x2018;spectral shift&#x2019; that marks mitolysosomes of mito-QC occurs by the selective quenching of GFP but not mCherry, resulting in &#x2018;red-only&#x2019; puncta (Figure S2D). Similarly, for mt-Keima the fluorescence spectra shifts to reflect an increased signal from excitation at 561 nm when under more acidic conditions (Figure S2E). With both mitophagy reporters we observed a striking co-localization of &#x2018;mitophagy&#x2019; puncta with LysoTracker (Figure S2D, E).</p>
<p>To further validate these puncta as mitolysosomes we assessed their formation in tissue lacking the canonical autophagy pathway generated by knockdown of the key autophagy factor <italic>Atg5</italic>. Mitolysosome signal reported by both mito-QC and mt-Keima were almost entirely absent in <italic>Atg5</italic>-RNAi epidermal cells (Figure S3A), consistent with their appearance reflecting mitophagy. Moreover, it was previously reported that iron chelation by deferiprone induced mitophagy reported by mito-QC (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2013</xref>). We also observed an increase in mitolysosomes reported by mito-QC and mt-Keima by feeding animals deferprione (Figure S3B). Taken together these findings validate the &#x2018;mitophagy&#x2019; signal of mito-QC and mt-Keima as faithful reporters of mitolysosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, similarly to previously characterized mouse models (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">McWilliams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Mitophagy is widespread in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues</title>
<p>We next determined the prevalence of mitolysosomes under basal conditions in multiple tissues. In larvae we analyzed epidermal cells, since they have an elaborate mitochondrial morphology, and the ventral ganglion, a major portion of the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we directly compared the mitolysosome signal reported by mito-QC and mt-Keima. Microscopic analysis revealed that mitolysosomes are abundant under basal conditions in both epidermal cells and CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, mitolysosomes were almost undetectable in larval body wall muscles (data not shown). Importantly, mito-QC and mt-Keima revealed a very similar abundance and distribution of mitolysosomes substantiating their utility as equivalent mitophagy reporters.</p>

<p>During this stage of analysis we found that the mt-Keima signal, which was already markedly weaker than that generated by mito-QC, was rapidly bleached upon extended exposure or repeated scanning. Repeated imaging was necessary to achieve adequate penetration into complex tissue and for z-stack (3D) reconstruction for mitolysosome quantification. For this reason the subsequent analyses mainly focused on analyzing mito-QC.</p>
<p>We next analyzed adult tissues where post-mitotic, highly energetic tissues would be expected to accumulate more mitochondrial damage and therefore likely undergo more mitophagy. Again, we observed abundant mitolysosomes widespread in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). PD is associated with the preferential degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which is reproduced in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of PD, including by cell autonomous loss of <italic>Pink1/parkin</italic> (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt and Whitworth, 2017</xref>). Mito-QC was selectively expressed in dopaminergic neurons via the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) GAL4 driver. Analyzing the PPL1 cluster that has most consistently been shown to be affected in <italic>Pink1/parkin</italic> mutants we observed a substantial mitophagy signal in the DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The amount of mitophagy signal did not markedly increase with ageing.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprising, but consistent with observations in larvae, we did not observe any appreciable mitolysosomes in adult muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is notable for two reasons; first, adult flight muscle in particular has extremely abundant mitochondria necessary to power flight. Second, <italic>Pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> display robust degeneration of flight muscles. It could be reasonably assumed that this degeneration results from a failure in mitophagy induction. We reasoned that analyzing adult tissue could possibly have missed a critical period when mitophagy is active and required for muscle integrity, such as when the tissue is being formed in development. To address this, we analyzed flight muscle of the pupal stage when disruption of muscle integrity first occurs in <italic>Pink1/parkin</italic> mutants (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Greene et al., 2005</xref>). However, we also could not detect mitolysosomes at these earlier time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Taken together, from these observations we surmise that mitophagy is abundant in various tissues during development and in adult flies, especially in neuronal tissue, but is not detectable in muscle tissue at either stage.</p>

<title>Pink1 and parkin are largely dispensable for basal mitophagy in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>Mammalian PINK1 and parkin have been described to play important roles in toxin-induced mitophagy, however, the impact of PINK1 and parkin on basal mitophagy <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been reported. To address this, we combined our mitophagy reporters with well-characterized <italic>Pink1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutants. Analyzing the previously described tissues where mitolysosomes were abundant, we found that mitophagy was not dramatically reduced in genetic null mutants for <italic>Pink1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and <italic>parkin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To quantify the degree of mitophagy we applied a semi-automated quantification analysis to segment 3-dimensional images to identify and quantify <italic>bone fide</italic> mitolysosomes (Figure S4). Surprisingly, quantitative analyses revealed there was no statistical difference in number of mitolysosomes between wild type and <italic>Pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutant animals for most cell types except for larval CNS where the difference in <italic>Pink1</italic> mutants just reached significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, although mitolysosomes were not detectable in WT flight muscle we considered that since profound mitochondrial disruption occurs in flight muscle of <italic>Pink1/parkin</italic> mutants mitophagy may be induced as a homeostatic response. However, we again observed no mitophagy signal in <italic>Pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutants (data not shown). Thus, taken together these data indicate that loss of Pink1 or parkin does not substantially influence basal mitophagy in neuromuscular tissues.</p>
<p>The notion that PINK1 and parkin cooperate to mediate bulk degradation of mitochondria has become a dominant concept in the field of PD pathogenesis. While a large body of work has elucidated the molecular details of PINK1/parkin mediated stress-induced mitophagy <italic>in vitro</italic>, it has been an open question whether PINK1 and parkin perform equivalent functions under physiological conditions (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Cummins and Gotz, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Rodger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Whitworth and Pallanck, 2017</xref>). We have made use of two previously devised mitophagy reporter constructs to visualize mitophagy in fly models for the first time. Our observations reveal that basal mitophagy is highly prevalent in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, however, this mitophagic process is essentially unaffected by null mutations in <italic>Pink1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>.</p>
<p>The simplest interpretation of these results is that PINK1 and parkin do not in fact play an important role in basal mitophagy; however, this seems unlikely given the plethora of evidence supporting PINK1/parkin in some form of mitochondrial degradation. A number of alternative explanations can be proffered. One clear possibility is that another mode of mitophagy can be induced as a compensatory mechanism. Indeed, there is some precedence for this as it was recently reported that MUL1 acts redundantly alongside parkin (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Rojansky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, while germline knockout of murine <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> has been shown to have very mild phenotypes (reviewed in (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>)), conditional post-natal loss of PINK1 or parkin has revealed robust loss of DA neurons (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2011</xref>). The authors propose that in germline knockouts an unknown mechanism is induced during development that compensated for loss of PINK1/parkin. One possibility that would fit this scenario is induction of an alternative mitophagy pathway or upregulation of other mitochondrial quality control processes. Clearly, more needs to be learned about the complex regulatory mechanisms governing mitochondrial turnover under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Another obvious interpretation of the current findings is that basal mitophagy may reflect a distinct homeostatic mechanism from that in which PINK1/parkin function. Indeed, whether the observed basal mitophagy is operating as a quality control mechanism or some other homeostatic process, such as maintenance of mitochondrial levels, is unknown. As previously described, the majority of studies analyzing PINK1/parkin mitophagy have used exogenous stressors and parkin over-expression, leaving it unclear what, if any, physiological stimuli provoke the same PINK1/parkin response. Nevertheless, supporting the requirement for a &#x2018;second hit&#x2019;, DA neurons become selectively vulnerable to loss of parkin when mitochondrial DNA mutations are elevated (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Pickrell et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Growing evidence indicates that PINK1/parkin-mediated turnover of mitochondrial components may occur in a piecemeal fashion. For instance, multiple studies have described the selective targeting of portions of mitochondria for turnover (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Burman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Hamalainen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">McLelland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">McLelland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Yang, 2013</xref>), a process likely occurring via so called mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Sugiura et al., 2014</xref>). That selective degradation of mitochondrial components may also occur <italic>in vivo</italic> is supported by compelling evidence using a mass spectrometric method to analyze isotope labeled mitochondrial protein turnover in flies (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Vincow et al., 2013</xref>). In light of this, it is clear that further work is needed to define the conditions in which PINK1 and parkin promote mitochondrial homeostasis. Notably, it will be important to determine the nature of physiological stressors trigger PINK1/parkin mitochondrial turnover. The mitophagy reporter lines described here provide new model systems for studying physiological mitophagy and can be potentially used for screening for novel regulators. Greater insights into the physiological function of PINK1/parkin-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis will allow a clearer understanding of the pathogenic causes of PD, and thus a better prospect for more rational therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Image analysis and quantification</title>
<p>Confocal images were processed using FIJI (ImageJ) software (RRID:SCR_002285) for figure presentation. For quantification of mitolysosomes, spinning disk microscopy generated images were processed using Imaris (version 9.0.2) analysis software (BitPlane) (RRID:SCR_007370) to identify and count individual &#x2018;red-only&#x2019; puncta. The GFP and mCherry signals were adjusted to reduce background noise and retain only the distinct mitochondria network and red puncta, respectively. A surface rendered 3D structure corresponding to the mitochondria network was generated using the GFP signal. This volume was subtracted from the red channel to retain the mCherry signal that did not co-localize with the GFP-labelled mitochondria network. The mitolysosome puncta were selected according to their intensity and an estimated size of 0.5 &#x03BC;m diameter, previously measured with Imaris. Additionally, the puncta were filtered with a minimum size cutoff of 0.2 &#x03BC;m diameter. The remaining puncta were counted as the number of mitolysosomes.</p>
<p>Epidermal cells and larval CNS soma were analyzed individually where discrete cells could be distinguished. For DA neurons and adult CNS soma, small groups of cells were analyzed together and an average score calculated per cell.</p>
<p>The average number of mitolysosomes per cell was calculated per animal based on several images. Data points in the quantification charts show mean mitolysosomes per cell for individual animals, where n = 6 animals for all conditions except 10 days old DA neurons where n = 3 animals.</p>
