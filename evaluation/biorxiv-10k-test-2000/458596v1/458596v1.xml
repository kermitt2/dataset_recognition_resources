<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The advancements in genotyping have opened new approaches for identification and precise mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in plants, particularly by combining linkage and association mapping (AM) analysis. In this study, a combination of linkage and AM approach was used to precisely identify and authenticate putative QTLs associated with black tea quality traits and &#x0025;RWC. The population structure analysis clustered two parents and their respective 261 F<sub>1</sub> progenies from the two reciprocal crosses into two clusters with 141 tea accessions in cluster one and 122 tea accessions in cluster two. The two clusters were of mixed origin with tea accessions in population TRFK St. 504 clustering together with tea accessions in population TRFK St. 524. A total of 70 putative QTLs linked to black tea quality traits and percent relative water contents (&#x0025;RWC) were detected in interval mapping (IM) method. Cofactors obtained in IM were used in multiple QTL model (MQM) mapping where 40 putative QTLs were detected. The phenotypic variance for each QTL ranged from 2.8-23.3&#x0025; in IM and 4.1-23&#x0025; in MQM mapping. Using Q-model and Q&#x002B;K-model in AM, a total of 49 DArTseq markers were associated with 16 phenotypic traits. Significant marker-trait association results obtained using AM were similar to those obtained in IM, and MQM mapping with six more QTLs detected in AM. The functional annotations of six additional putative QTLs detected in AM were involved in purine/thiamine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, carbon fixation and abiotic stress. The application of a combination of linkage and AM approach appears to have great potential and could reduce the cost and improve the efficacy and accuracy of selection of desirable traits in tea breeding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Linkage mapping has been a key tool for identifying the genetic basis of quantitative traits in plants. However, linkage mapping is usually limited by low polymorphism or small population size, which is required for suitable crosses. Also, the mapping resolution is limited by few recombination events, which are considered to estimate the genetic distances between marker loci causative genomic regions for QTLs. AM also known as LD mapping has extensively been used to circumvent the limitations posed by linkage mapping in plants in the last few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). AM which exploits broader genetic diversity offers more advantages over linkage mapping in terms of mapping resolution, allele number, saves time in establishing a marker-trait association and its application in a breeding program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Although linkage mapping and AM each offer more advantages over the other, they are often applied in conjunction to validate the QTL identified, thus reducing spurious associations.</p>
<p>The integrated approach of linkage-AM has been used in other plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) to dissect quantitatively inherited traits. In tree species, an integrated method of linkage mapping and AM to decipher the nature of genetic architecture of potential QTLs for growth traits has been reported in poplar hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and maritime pine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In grapes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) combined linkage mapping and AM to study the genetic patterns of anthocyanin content, a determinant of berry colour, in grapes. In a study to investigate genetic relationship between tea caffeine synthase gene (TCS1) and the caffeine content in tea plant and its related species, AM was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). In this current study, we combined the high QTL detection power of the linkage mapping with the high-resolution power of AM. The linkage-AM approach will not only accelerate the pace of QTL mapping in tea breeding improvement but will also precisely identify reliable QTLs linked to black tea quality and drought tolerance in tea. The objective of this study was to combine linkage mapping and AM to precisely identify and authenticate putative QTLs linked to caffeine content, catechins fractions, theaflavins fractions, tea tasters&#x2019; scores, and &#x0025;RWC.</p>

<title>Population structure</title>
<p>The population structure was inferred from the 1,421 DArT markers data previously used to construct genetic linkage map using the STRUCTURE software version 2.3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Twenty independent runs were carried out using the following parameters; number of populations (K) from 1 to 10, burn-in time and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) replication number were both set to 100,000 for model of admixture with correlated allele frequencies. The natural logarithms of the probability data (LnP(K)) and the <italic>ad hoc</italic> delta K statistical were calculated using STRUCTURE Harvester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and the optimal K according to the delta K value was then selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Finally, the population structure matrix (Q) was obtained by integrating 20 independent replicate runs and applying CLUMPP software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). STRUCTURE bar plots were plotted using STRUCTURE Plot v 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>

<p>Six thousand five hundred and eighty-eight DArTseq markers derived from <italic>C. sinensis</italic> genomic DNA of the two parents and 261 F<sub>1</sub> progeny were subjected to linkage mapping analyses using JoinMap 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and QTL mapping analyses using MapQTL 6.0 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) as described previously (Koech <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018).</p>

<title>Population structure</title>
<p>A total of 261 tea accessions, 109 for population TRFK St. 504 and 152 for population TRFK St.524 were combined to construct a panel to study their genetic structure. The two tea populations, TRFK St. 504 and TRFK St. 524 are a reciprocal cross of two parents TRFK 303/577 and GW Ejulu. A population structure analysis showed that the value of Evanno&#x2019;s &#x0394;K presented a sharp spike at K &#x003D; 2, which suggested that this population panel was clustered into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). The two groups or clusters are represented by two clades with parental clone TRFK 303/577 clustering with 141 progenies in cluster one (blue) and parental clone GW Ejulu (not shown) clustering with 122 progenies in cluster two (black), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). The two clusters were accession with mixed origin with tea accessions in TRFK St. 504 population clustering together with tea accessions in TRFK St. 524 population. Furthermore, the results from PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>) and a phylogenetic tree-based on Nei&#x2019;s genetic distance was in agreement with the structure analysis results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). The population structure of the two tea populations was examined with the neighbour-joining algorithm using Euclidian distance on the DArTseq marker band intensities.</p>

<title>Interval mapping and allelic effects</title>
<p>The genetic linkage map was constructed using a total of 1,421 DArT markers as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). A total of 70 putative QTLs were identified for the 16 phenotypic traits measured using the interval mapping (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Of all the putative QTLs identified, most QTLs were found in almost all linkage groups, except LG03, LG05 and LG11. For black tea quality traits, 67 putative QTLs were detected and were located on almost all linkage groups, except on LG03, LG05 and LG11. The remaining three putative QTLs which are associated with drought tolerance were identified in LG02, LG06 and LG09. Eight putative QTLs were identified on LG01, seven in LG02 and LG12, 10 in LG04, five in LG06 and LG15, three in LG07, LG08, LG09, two in LG10, 15 in LG13, four in LG15, respectively. The highest number of putative QTLs were associated with catechin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), EGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), tea tasters&#x2019; score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and EGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), respectively. The phenotypic variance for all the identified putative QTLs ranged from 2.8&#x0025; for EGC to 23.3&#x0025; for qECG, respectively. The phenotypic variance for &#x0025;RWC ranged from 5.7 to 7.3&#x0025;, while for the tea tasters&#x2019; score, it ranged from 5.8 to 9.1&#x0025;. Half of the allelic effects identified to be associated with black tea quality and drought tolerance traits had a positive additive effect. There were eight allelic effects associated with female additivity, and 18 were associated with male additive effects, respectively. The highest positive female and male additive effects were qEGC and qECG, respectively. Although, some putative QTLs also exhibited high negative allelic effects, which were from either female or male additive effects or both, such as qEGCG, qCAT, qEC and qCaffeine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All the putative QTLs identified in IM were used as cofactors in MQM mapping.</p>

<title>Multiple QTL model mapping and allelic effects</title>
<p>A total of 40 putative QTLs (LOD &#x003E; 3.0) were identified in 16 phenotypic traits using MQM mapping method from the selected cofactors in IM. Similarly, no putative QTLs in LG03, LG05 and LG11, respectively were associated with any of the phenotypic traits. Most of the putative QTLs previously identified in IM were also identified MQM mapping. Of these 40 putative QTLs identified, 37 putative QTLs that were associated with black tea quality traits while three were associated with qRWC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The three putative QTLs associated with qRWC were similar to those identified in IM. Four putative QTLs were identified in LG01 and LG12, seven in LG02, five in LG04, three in LG06, LG09, LG13, LG14 and LG15, two in LG07 and LG08 and one in LG01, respectively. A similar trend was observed in the number of putative QTLs for each trait as in IM with a high putative QTL number for catechin, ECG, EGC and caffeine, respectively. The phenotypic variance for all the identified putative QTL ranged from 4.1&#x0025; for qCAT to 23&#x0025; for qECG, respectively. The phenotypic variance for qRWC was similar to IM results, and it ranged from 5.7 to 7.3&#x0025;, while for the tea tasters&#x2019; score, it ranged from 6.0 to 9.1&#x0025;. For allelic effects, similar results to IM with qEGC and qECG showing high positive female additive and male additive effects, respectively, this trend was also observed in MQM mapping. The putative QTLs identified using both IM, and MQM mapping were almost similar although the efficiency and the accuracy of detecting QTL is achieved by employing MQM instead of the single QTL model used in IM.</p>

<title>Association mapping</title>
<p>Four models GLM, GLM (Q), mixed linear model with kinship matrix (MLM) (K) and mixed linear model with kinship matix and population structure matrix (MLM) (Q&#x002B;K) in TASSEL software v5.2.43 were used to determine AM and the effects of population structure on the AM to reduce the inflation of false-positive associations. The p-values were plotted cumulatively for each model, and the distribution examined. However, no further analysis was done using GLM model since marker-trait association results were characterised by excess small p-values, which indicated an abundance of spurious associations (S1 Fig). The association analysis using the Q-model and Q&#x002B;K-model detected a total of 49 DArT markers associated with 15 different black tea quality traits and one drought-tolerant trait. The GLM (Q) model showed associations between DArT markers and traits (p &#x003C; 0.01) and was confirmed using the MLM (Q&#x002B;K) model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, S2-S4 Figs). The MLM Q&#x002B;K-model (MLM with Q-matrix and K-matrix as a correction for population structure) showed a good fit for the p-values (p &#x003C; 0.01), as compared to GLM (Q) models, which were characterised by a few associations with excess of small p-values, which indicates abundance of spurious associations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, S2 and S4 Figs). Also, the MLM Q&#x002B;K-model also showed better small p-values than the K-model (MLM with K-matrix as a correction for population structure) (S3 and S4 Figs). The GLM (Q) model may not have accounted for the heterogeneity of the genetic background in some tea cultivars under study, which may have resulted in false-positive associations. Ideally, the distribution of p-values should follow a uniform distribution with less deviation from the expected p-values. However, the two models were used to compare the effect of population matrix and kinship matrix on GLM and MLM, respectively, in associating mapping. Therefore, taking into account the performance of the two different models, the results from the MLM (Q&#x002B;K) model appeared to have controlled better population structure and kinship relationships than GLM (Q) model. While it might be tempting to consider p-values that remain extreme after MLM (Q&#x002B;K) model correction as true associations, we need to keep in mind that minor allele frequency also influences p-values.</p>

<p>A total of 49 DArT markers were associated with 16 different phenotypic traits in six out of 15 linkage groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Since, all 1,421 DArT markers in the genotypic dataset had a known map location, the loci associated with particular traits could be allocated to a linkage group. The numbers of marker loci associated with traits together with their location and positions in different linkage groups at a test level of p&#x003C; 0.01 in the two test models are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Choosing a significance level of p&#x003C; 0.01 which involves multiple testing corrections in both GLM (Q) and MLM (Q&#x002B;K) models, 32 DArT marker loci were detected for all individual catechins (C, EC, ECG, EGC, EGCG), scattered over five linkage groups namely LG01, LG02, LG04, LG12 and LG15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). For caffeine trait, three DArT markers were only located in LG02 while 11 DArT markers for all individual theaflavins traits (TF1, TF2, TF3, TF4) were detected in LG04 and LG15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The trait for tea liquor colour which is an indicator for black tea quality in terms of tea tasters&#x2019; score appeared to be associated with only one DArT marker locus at the significance level of p&#x003C; 0.01 in LG07 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Drought tolerance trait (&#x0025;RWC) was also associated with only one DArT marker locus detected in LG02 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The majority of the DArT markers loci associated with the traits were found in LG04, LG12, LG15, LG02, and LG01. The three DArT markers associated with catechin trait in LG04, namely, 5136945, 5064764 and 5134490 had the highest proportion of the percent explained phenotypic variation of 41&#x0025;, 38&#x0025;, and 25&#x0025;, respectively. The DArT markers that also showed high proportion of percent explained phenotypic variation were also observed in LG04 for qEGCG, qEGC, and qTF1 traits, respectively. In this study, a pleiotropic locus which is associated with a single locus affecting two or more distinct phenotypic traits was observed. Several pleiotropic loci were identified including DArT markers 5136945, 5112438, 5136058, 5123257, 5106022 and 5064764 which were associated with qC, qEC, qEGC, qTF1, qTF2 and qTF4 phenotypic traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). All the pleiotropic loci detected and associated with the respective phenotypic traits were located in LG04.</p>

<title>A comparison of linkage mapping and association mapping</title>
<p>The putative QTLs detected using IM, and MQM mapping in MapQTL 6.0 were compared with marker-trait association results obtained using GLM (Q) and MLM (Q&#x002B;K) models in AM. The significant marker-trait association results obtained using AM were similar to with the results obtained using MapQTL 6.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref>). The IM analysis produced 14 significant QTLs (LOD &#x003E; 3.0) that were also found to be associated with the phenotypic traits in AM analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). From the 14 QTLs, a total of 11 markers were associated with four individual catechins (qCAT, qEC, qECG, and qEGC) and one marker each was associated with qTF2, qCL, and qRWC, respectively. On the other hand, the MQM mapping analysis produced eight significant QTLs (LOD &#x003E; 3.0) which were also found to be significantly associated with the phenotypic traits in AM analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Of these, five markers were associated with four individual catechins (qCAT, qEC, qECG, and qEGC) and one marker each was associated with qTF2, qCL, and qRWC, respectively. Furthermore, the four mapping models were compared with each other to find markers that could associate with phenotypic traits in all four mapping models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>). A total of 13 markers were found to be associated with four individual catechins (qCAT, qEC, qECG, and qEGC) and one marker each was associated with qTF2, qCL, and qRWC, respectively. Most of the markers that were associated with different phenotypic traits were only located in LG01, LG02, LG04, LG12 and LG15 with a majority of markers showing both positive and negative male additive effects.</p>

<title>Functional annotation of putative QTLs in linkage and association mapping</title>
<p>The putative QTLs detected in both IM, and MQM mapping were identified by the BLAST algorithm, searched on the reference tea genome (NCBI) and assigned functions on Blast2GO database. A total of 53 QTLs were detected in both interval and MQM mapping methods, of which 45 proteins were assigned functions. An additional six markers in LG02, LG04, and LG12 were found to be associated with caffeine, EC, ECG and EGC traits in AM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Table 7</xref>). The six additional QTLs detected in AM were also functionally annotated using the above databases. The putative candidate genes identified were involved in purine or thiamine biosynthesis, phenylalanine biosynthesis, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, carbon fixation (photosynthesis) and abiotic stress. The putative QTL, qCaffeine in LG02 was putatively annotated N-(5&#x2019;phosphoribosyl) anthranilate (PRA) isomerase enzyme. The two other putative QTLs identified for qEC and qEGC located in LG04 were annotated as phosphoribulokinase or uridine kinase family proteins. Two putative QTLs, for qEC in LG04, were annotated as autophagy-related protein 11 and protein tyrosine kinase, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this current study, a combination of linkage mapping and AM was used to provide a mutual and precise authentication of QTL, which will enable more reliable results to be obtained. Linkage mapping method has a relatively low genome resolution while AM method is affected by population structure and individual relationships. The combination of linkage mapping and AM has successfully been applied to many plant studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>The population structure analysis in discovery mapping panel used in the current study identified two groups or clusters. The dendrogram demonstrated two subspecies of the two parental clones, TRFK 303/577 and GW Ejulu, which are of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> var. <italic>assamica</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> var. <italic>sinensis</italic> variety, respectively. The neighbour-joining tree for the 261 tea accessions grouped them into two major clusters on the base of Nei&#x2019;s genetic distance. The phylogenetic relationships for the parental cultivars and their progenies clustering into their respective groups in separate clades based on their parental genotypes were consistent with their genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The parental clone TRFK 303/577, which is an open-pollinated progeny of clone TRFK 6/8, is high-yielding, drought-tolerant, medium in black tea quality, caffeine, and individual catechins. On the other hand, parental clone GW Ejulu is a low-yielding, high black tea quality and moderate levels of caffeine, but high in total catechins and individual catechin contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The bulk of tea cultivars used for green and black tea production have been derived through individual selection, hybridisation and molecular breeding of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> var. <italic>assamica</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> var. <italic>sinensi</italic>s varieties to produce tea with desirable characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Therefore, developing a few markers that have the capability of discriminating the two subspecies and their cultivars is of paramount interest. The results on the linkage mapping for all the phenotypic traits and the QTL positions in different linkage groups in this study were similar as reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, AM was conducted with three different models, Q, K, and Q&#x002B;K. The observed &#x2013; log10 (P) values for QTL deviated from the expected &#x2013;log10 (P) values in the Q method (GLM), indicated that there might be a few false-positive. However, the addition of genetic relatedness K (kinship) used in a mixed linear model has proven to be more powerful and reduces the number of false-positive associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This is because a lot more QTLs were identified in this current study using Q-model as compared with K and Q &#x002B; K-model. Therefore, there could be higher chances of false-positive or negative errors in AM due to complex population structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In this study, a mixed linear model approach using the K-matrix or a combination (Q&#x002B;K) performed better than a GLM (Q). However, the K or the Q &#x002B; K methods did show to be too strict and resulted in the missing of some possibly useful QTLs. Nearly all the significant QTLs identified in AM using the Q, and Q&#x002B;K models were in line with those identified in MapQTL 6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The percentages of phenotypic variation explained (R<sup>2</sup>) by various markers analysed using AM were significant as those analysed using MapQTL 6.0. This is in agreement with previous studies reported in plants on efficiency and robustness of combining linkage mapping and AM for precise identification of QTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>The six additional QTLs identified in AM were found to be associated with purine or thiamine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, carbon fixation (photosynthesis) and abiotic stress. The putative QTL, qCaffeine located in LG02 was putatively annotated N-(5&#x2019;phosphoribosyl) anthranilate (PRA) isomerase enzyme. The enzyme is involved in the first and intermediate pathway in the purine or thiamine biosynthesis and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and other methylxanthines such as theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) and methyluric acids present in tea are classified as purine alkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Therefore, the putative QTL, qCaffeine could be associated with the biosynthesis of caffeine, theobromine and methyluric acids in tea. Also, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are products of shikimate pathway which is involved in the biosynthesis of plant flavonoids, including catechins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>The putative QTLs, qEC, and qEGC in LG04 were annotated as phosphoribulokinase/uridine kinase family proteins which are involved in carbon fixation or photosynthesis in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Photosynthesis is an important process in plants for provision of carbon skeletons to the shikimate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Catechins are synthesised in the leaves of the tea plant through the acetic-malonic acid and shikimic-cinnamic acid metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The chalcone and gallic acid are produced from the shikimic acid pathway, which then produce the different catechins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The two putative QTLs, qEC annotated putatively as autophagy-related protein 11 and protein tyrosine kinase are involved in abiotic stress response through a process of stomatal closure and ABA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Stress conditions can interfere with photosynthetic energy production in plants, which leads to stomatal closure, which inhibits CO<sub>2</sub> intake and thereby reduces photosynthetic activity in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Abscisic acid has been reported to confer abiotic stress-tolerance in crop plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In stress conditions like drought, extreme temperature, and high salinity, content in plants increases considerably, inspiring stress-tolerance effects that help plants, adapt, and survive under these stressful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Also, ABA is also required for plant growth and development under non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The tea plant is a woody perennial crop with long generation intervals, which usually hinders its genetic improvement by conventional breeding methods. The approach of combining the high QTL detection power of genetic linkage mapping with the high-resolution power of AM allowed identification and precise authentication of putative QTL controlling black tea quality and drought tolerance traits. Based on the two mapping approaches, the putative QTLs associated with caffeine content, catechins fractions, theaflavins fractions, tea tasters&#x2019; scores, and &#x0025;RWC detected in linkage mapping and AM were not significantly different except that an additional six more QTLs were detected using AM method. Therefore, the combination of linkage and association strategies can be used to identify closely linked molecular markers for robust MAS and trait introgression. This will accelerate tea breeding progress in terms of reduced breeding time, reduced cost, increased efficiency, and precision of selection.</p>
