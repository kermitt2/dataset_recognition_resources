<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Large (&#x003E;10 kb) palindromic sequences are enriched on mammalian sex chromosomes. In mice, these palindromes harbor gene families (&#x2265;2 gene copies) expressed exclusively in post-meiotic testicular germ cells, at a time when most single-copy sex-linked genes are transcriptionally repressed. This distinct expression pattern led to the hypothesis that containment within palindrome structures or having &#x2265;2 gene enables post-meiotic gene expression. We tested these two hypotheses by using CRISPR to precisely engineer large (10&#x2019;s of kb) inversions and deletions of X chromosome palindrome arms for two regions carrying the mouse <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families. We found that <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene expression is unaffected in mice carrying palindrome arm inversions, suggesting that palindromic structure is not important for mediating palindrome-associated gene expression. We also found that <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene expression is reduced by half in mice carrying palindrome arm deletions, allowing us to test whether palindrome-associated genes are sensitive to reduced expression levels resulting in spermatogenic defects. Male mice carrying palindrome arm deletions of <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> or <italic>Mageb5</italic>, however, are fertile, have normal testis histology, and show no aberrations in spermatogenic cell population frequencies via FACS quantification. Together, these findings suggest that large palindromic structures on the sex chromosomes are not necessary for their associated genes to evade post-meiotic transcriptional repression and that these genes are not sensitive to reduced expression levels. Large sex chromosome palindromes may thus be important for other reasons, such as the long-term evolutionary stability of their associated gene families.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In humans and mice, the sex chromosomes are enriched for large (&#x003E;10kb), nearly identical (&#x003E;99&#x0025; nucleotide identity) segmental duplications in palindromic orientation<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In mice, genes harbored within large X chromosome palindromes are expressed predominantly or exclusively in post-meiotic testicular germ cells<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. This specific expression pattern is surprising, because most single-copy X-linked genes are transcriptionally silenced post-meiosis<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The mechanism by which palindrome-associated genes escape transcriptional repression is unknown; however, two hypotheses have been suggested to explain this distinct expression pattern. First, palindromes may form secondary structures (e.g. palindrome arms pairing to form a hairpin) enabling their associated genes to evade transcriptional repression<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Intrachromosomal synapsis of palindrome arm pairing could facilitate the evasion of post-meiotic gene repression, which itself is a consequence of asynapsis-triggered meiotic sex chromosome inactivation<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Second, X-palindromic genes may be sensitive to reduced expression levels and thus require &#x2265;2 gene copies<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, the mouse X chromosome carries other non-palindromic genes that are in multiple copies and are expressed specifically in post-meiotic cells<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. To test the two hypotheses, individual palindrome arms must be genetically manipulated, in vivo.</p>
<p>To rigorously test whether palindrome structure or gene copy number is important for post-meiotic expression, we genetically dissected two mouse X-palindromes. We utilized CRISPR to generate large-scale (10&#x2019;s of kb) inversions and deletions in mice of two X-palindrome arms harboring the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> (<italic>Melanoma antigen gene family member b5</italic>) gene families. We chose these two X-palindromes because of their canonical features of palindromes across mammals; they have &#x003E;99&#x0025; percent nucleotide identity between the two arms, the arms are &#x003E;10kb, and they harbor a gene family expressed specifically in post-meiotic testicular germ cells. We also selected these two gene families because they have sequence family variants between the two gene copies, enabling detection of palindrome arm-specific expression. We found that for the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> palindromic gene families, palindrome structure is not necessary for regulating their associated post-meiotic gene expression. We observed that deletion of a single palindrome arm, for both the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families, reduces gene expression levels by half; however, reduced expression levels did not lead to male infertility or spermatogenic defects in either case. This suggests that palindromes enrichment on the sex chromosomes is important for other reasons and that there are alternative, unknown mechanisms for palindrome-associated genes to evade post-meiotic repression.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Generation of 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 palindrome arm inversions and deletions</title>
<p>To generate mice carrying palindrome arm inversions and deletions we used CRISPR with dual sgRNAs (single guide RNAs). sgRNAs were designed to unique sequences flanking the targeted palindrome arm, as close to the edge of the arm as possible. Since sgRNA cutting efficiency varies between sgRNAs, we tested their activity via pronuclear injection of an sgRNA/Cas9 expression plasmid, pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (pX458)<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> in mouse zygotes. The surviving mouse zygotes were allowed to develop into 64-128 cell blastocysts and the cutting efficiency of each sgRNA was determined by PCR of the cut sties and Sanger sequencing of purified PCR products to identify local edits at the target sites.</p>
<p>Once active sgRNAs were identified for both sides of the targeted palindrome arm, two pX458M plasmids encoding the sgRNAs and Cas9 together with a single-stranded oligonucleotide were pronuclear injected into hybrid C57BL/6JxSJL hybrid mouse zygotes. We added single-stranded oligonucleotides with sequence homology flanking the junction boundaries, to promote either inversions or deletions. The zygotes were generated from mating C57BL/6J females to C57BL/6JxSJL males so that all targeted X chromosomes were C57BL/6J. Blastocysts from the pronuclear injection where implanted into pseudopregnant females. Genomic DNA from resulting pups was screened via PCR and Sanger sequencing for the inversion and deletion junctions. At least two independent mouse lines were obtained for inversions and deletions of the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> palindrome arms. Male and female mice were able to germline transmit both the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> deletions and inversions, thus their overall health was unaffected by our CRISPR-mediated chromosome engineering.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mice and testis sample collection</title>
<p>All mice carrying an inversion or deletion of a single palindrome arm were backcrossed to C57BL/6J (N2-N7). Backcrossing was performed to minimize any possible CRISPR-mediated off-target effects. For assessing fecundity (average litter size per male), we mated mutant males to CD1 females. Testes were collected from 2-6 month old males for all experiments. We used wild-type littermate controls whenever possible and if not available, we used age-matched controls from the same breeding line. The alleles for the first mouse lines of each type were named <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>InvArm1</italic></sup>, <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm1</italic></sup>, <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>InvArm1</italic></sup>, <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm1</italic></sup> with respective registered symbols Del(X4930567H17Rik)1Jbmu, In(X4930567H17Rik)1Jbmu, Del(XMageb5)1Jbmu, In(XMageb5)1Jbmu.

<title>Preparation of adult testis cDNA for qPCR</title>
<p>Intron-spanning primers, when possible, were used to perform qPCR on adult testis cDNA preparations. One testis per mouse was used to isolate RNA using Trizol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers recommendations. 5 &#x03BC;g of total RNA was DNase treated with TurboDNase (Ambion) and reversed transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligonucleotide (dT) primers following the manufacturers protocol. qPCR was performed in triplicate using Power SYBR Green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a 7500 Real-time PCR thermalcycler (Applied Biosystems). <italic>Trim42</italic> (<italic>Tripartite motif-containing 42</italic>) was used as a normalization control, because it is expressed specifically in the same post-meiotic testicular cells and at similar levels as <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic>.

Briefly, we disassociated cells from a single testis by enzymatic treatment with Collagenase type I, DNase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation), and Trypsin (Life Technologies). The cell suspension was passed through cell strainers (100 &#x03BC;m and 40 &#x03BC;m) and incubated with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) for DNA content and propidium iodide (Acros Organics) for cell viability. Cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

<title>The mouse X chromosome harbors eight singleton palindromes</title>
<p>Large palindromes on mammalian sex chromosomes are typically found as isolated pairs of palindrome arms (singleton palindromes) or in complex arrays of palindromes. We investigated singleton palindromes, because they are more commonly found across mammalian sex chromosomes and can be genetically manipulated in vivo more precisely. Of the eight singleton palindromes on the mouse X chromosome (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), we selected two harboring the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5,</italic> because they share canonical features of sex chromosome palindromes: &#x003E;10kb, &#x003E;99&#x0025; nucleotide identity between palindrome arms, harbor genes expressed specifically in testicular germ cells, and have a spacer sequence between the palindrome arms (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, the palindrome carrying the 4930567H17Rik gene family has the longest palindrome arm (65kb), for a singleton palindrome, which if we can delete and invert in mice, will serve as a proof of principle for the manipulation of shorter palindrome arms.</p>

<p>We wanted to ensure that the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families are expressed exclusively in post-meiotic round spermatids and that both copies are expressed. By reanalyzing previously published RNA-seq datasets, we find that both gene families are expressed exclusively in round spermatids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We consider the low levels of expression in spermatogonia to be due to contamination of round spermatids in the spermatogonial populations during sorting. To determine if both <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene copies are expressed, we utilized individual nucleotide differences between gene copies. Sequencing of RT-PCR products for both <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> show that both gene copies are expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).

<title>Generation of mice carrying precise inversions and deletions of individual X-palindrome arms via CRISPR</title>
<p>We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to precisely invert and delete large X-palindromes arms in mice. Pronuclear injection of mouse zygotes with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), targeting unique flanking regions of each palindrome arm, and a single stranded oligonucleotide donor enabled us to generate large (29 kb and 65 kb) inversions and deletions of individual arms for the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> X-palindromes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The single stranded oligonucleotide donors were used to promote inversions and deletions. We screened founder mouse lines with all combinations of primers flanking the sgRNA cut sites in order to detect and distinguish inversions and deletions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We validated inversion and deletion junctions by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). After &#x007E;300 pronucelar injections we obtained 2 and 3 independent mouse lines carrying deletions of a single palindrome arm for the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families, respectively. Similarly, after &#x007E;300 pronuclear injections we obtained 4 and 2 independent mouse lines carrying inversions of a single palindrome arm for the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families, respectively. The independently obtained inversion and deletion junctions differed from each other by only a few nucleotides. We also confirmed the deletions via Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR products to show that only a single sequence family variant was expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) in each mouse line. We selected two deletion and two inversion independent mouse lines for each X-palindromic region.

<title>Disruption of palindrome structure, via inverting a single palindrome arm, does not affect the gene expression levels of the palindrome associated gene family</title>

<title>Deleting a single palindrome arm reduces the gene expression level of the palindrome-associated gene family by half</title>
<p>Using mice carrying single palindrome arm deletions, we reduced the gene copy number of the palindrome associated <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> X-linked genes by half (2 gene copies to 1). Concordantly, we expected <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene expression levels would drop by half in <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice. Using gene-specific primers for <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic>, we compared the testis gene expression levels of <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice to wild-type controls and normalized to <italic>Trim42</italic>. After normalization, we indeed find that <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice, across two independent mouse lines, express their associated genes at approximately half the levels of wild-type males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The reduction of gene expression by half allows us to test whether the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families are sensitive to reduced gene expression levels, resulting in males that are infertile with defects in post-meiotic spermatogenic development.</p>

<title>Male mice carrying deletions of individual palindrome arms do not exhibit defects in fecundity, testis histology, or numbers of round spermatids</title>
<p>We performed a systematic characterization of fecundity and post-meiotic spermatogenic development in <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice. We found that <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice are fertile and produce litter sizes that are similar to wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To detect potential defects in post-meiotic spermatid development, we examined testis histological sections of <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice. We did not observe defects in spermatid morphology, formation of the acrosome, initiation of spermatid elongation or their formation or the presence of abnormal elongated spermatids in the epithelium. To assess whether the number of round spermatids were affected in <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice, we quantified the number of round spermatids per testis as the ratio of round spermatids/spermatocytes (control) via FACs. We find that the ratio of round spermatids/spermatoyctes of <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice is similar to wild-type males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), which is consistent with their testis weights also being similar. Altogether, <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Mageb5</italic><sup><italic>DelArm/Y</italic></sup> mice do not exhibit detectable defects in fecundity and post-meiotic spermatid development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our finding that palindrome structure is not necessary for facilitating post-meiotic gene expression for <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families leaves open the question as to why palindromes are heavily enriched on both the mammalian X and Y chromosomes. It is possible that palindromes, both on the X and Y chromosomes, are necessary for long-term evolutionary stability of the genes they harbor in order to rapidly purge deleterious mutations via gene conversion<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our findings also show that the <italic>4930567H17Rik</italic> and <italic>Mageb5</italic> gene families are not sensitive to reduced gene expression levels, when a single palindrome arm deletion reduces the gene copy number from 2 to 1. This, together with our findings on palindrome structures, suggests there are alternative mechanisms for X-palindromic genes to be expressed on the otherwise transcriptionally repressed X chromosome. There are a small number of X-linked single-copy genes expressed in round spermatids<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, indicating that multiple gene copies are not a strict requirement for post-meiotic gene expression from the sex chromosomes. Thus, specific enhancers and transcription factors may have evolved to overcome the transcriptional repression associated with the rest of the sex chromosomes. Two potential transcription factors that facilitate post-meiotic sex-linked gene expression are Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1), which localizes to sex chromatin<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and HSF2, which preferentially binds chromatin of Y-palindromic genes<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, the testis is known to have specialized transcription regulation strategies in post-meiotic testicular germ cells<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and appears to have evolved a unique mechanism for palindromic and multicopy X- and Y-linked genes.</p>
