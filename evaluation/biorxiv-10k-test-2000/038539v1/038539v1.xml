<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigated the association between MHC-DRB1 exon2 and Brucellosis susceptibility in Chinese Merino sheep. MHC-DRB1 exon2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 126 healthy and 67 Brucellosis-infected Chinese Merino sheep. PCR products were analyzed using the SSCP technique, and then cloned to allow sequencing of the different alleles. For each SNP, allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between case and control samples, in addition the association with Brucellosis susceptibility was determined. Haplotypes and their frequencies were established and analyzed by SHEsis online software. There were forty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 270 bp DNA sequence. The distribution of C&#x003E;T alleles at locus 109 was significantly different between case and control samples. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that there were nine LD blocks in MHC-DRB1 exon2 and strong LD between SNPs existed in every Block. Haplotype analysis identified nine haplotypes with strong LD, but only Hap8 and Hap9 in case-control groups were significantly different (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.05); neither haplotype contained the C&#x003E;T allele at locus 109. In conclusion, genetic variants of MHC-DRB1 gene exon2 demonstrated associations with Brucellosis susceptibility, indicating that further research is warranted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brucellosis, caused by the <italic>Brucella</italic> genus, is a widespread, chronic, zoonotic disease of animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Corbel, 1997</xref>). Xinjiang Province in Western China is an important source of production animals, including sheep, cattle, goats and deer. Chinese Merino sheep are one of the most populous breeds in Xinjiang. The presence of <italic>Brucella</italic> is serious, not only because of the harmful effect on human health, but also because infected sheep have lower production. Consequently, there is interest in finding effective means to both prevent <italic>Brucella</italic> infections and to reduce the presence of the <italic>Brucella</italic> organism in Xinjiang. <italic>Brucella</italic> is considered a major health problem requiring urgent action.</p>
<p>The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a genetic region comprised of clustered genes which control the regulation of immune response (Ji et al., 2010). Two groups of cell-surface glycoproteins, termed Class I and Class II molecules, are the major MHC-encoded effector molecules and they are intimately involved in T- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune reactions. The ovine MHC, or Ovine Lymphocyte Antigen (OLA), harbors clusters of immunological genes involved in overall resistance/susceptibility of animals to infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Danchin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Flajnik and Kasahara, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Kaufman, 2002</xref>). The ovine DRB1 locus is located in the MHC Class II region, and its function is to present extracellular-derived peptides to the immune system. To date, associations between ovine Class II genetic markers and disease susceptibility have been limited to the MHC Class II Orar-DRB1 locus. Reported relationships in sheep include bovine leukemia virus disease, Maedi-Visna and hydatidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Larruskain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The majority of nucleotide polymorphisms in Class II loci locate to exon2, consequently, this region has been the principal target in genotyping studies designed to associate MHC genetic diversity with susceptibility to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Fallin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Konnai et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) belong to the third generation molecular marker technology. Each non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) changes one amino acid in the gene product causing Single Amino-acid Polymorphisms (SAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Schaefer et al., 2012</xref>). SNPs are useful genetic markers and can assist in searching for genetic risk factors associated with complex diseases. The application of SNPs in the recognition and identification of disease susceptibility genes has become a key research area. Following completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the International Human Genome Haplotype Map (HapMap) in 2005, the HapMap offered an important additional tool to discover genetic variants associated with diseases. Research using SNPs and haplotypes will play an important role in exploring genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of complex diseases.</p>
<p>Individual SNPs play only a minor role in explaining the genetic variation in complex diseases. However, the genetic information provided by haplotypes is more useful in describing the polygenic nature of genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Zaykin et al., 2002</xref>). As a consequence, haplotype analysis is increasingly becoming the preferred method for the study of complex diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Dukkipati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Sayers et al., 2005</xref>). If a specific haplotype can be shown to be distributed differently between case and control samples, this provides strong evidence that the haplotype is associated with the disease, and provides a shortcut for polygenic disease research. While haplotype analysis has been applied to study of the human MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), this research technique has not been widely applied to investigate the association between animal MHC haplotypes and disease susceptibility.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between SNPs and haplotypes of the MHC-DRB1 exon2 in Chinese Merino sheep and Brucellosis susceptibility.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The Rose Bengal Plate Agglutination Test (RBPT) was used to detect Chinese Merino sheep that expressed antibodies to <italic>Brucella</italic> and were thus considered positive for <italic>Brucella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Out of 193 sheep tested, 126 (65&#x0025;) were negative for <italic>Brucella</italic>, and 67 (35&#x0025;) tested positive.</p>

<p>PCR amplification products of MHC-DRB1 exon2 were examined via SSCP electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Due to the PCR-SSCP method having high sensitivity, many SNP genotypes were detected. Some genotypes were only detected in one individual, and it would be useful to expand the number of sheep sampled to be confident these low frequency SNPs are real.</p>

<p>In this study, the PCR-SSCP technique and sequence alignment results demonstrated that MHC-DRB1 gene exon2 of Chinese Merino sheep was richly polymorphic. Sequence alignments were analyzed by GeneDoc software, and the results of alignment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. A total of forty-one SNPs were identified in the 270bp length. SNP allelic and genotypic frequencies for case and control groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, respectively. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests showed no significant differences (<italic>P</italic>&#x003E;0.001).</p>

<p>Insertion and deletion sites did not exist in these SNPs. There were nine sites belonging to the PIP and thirty-two belonging to the SP. There were 18 SP conversion sites, including 7 A/G and 11 T/C, and 14 transversion sites, including 1 C/A, 6 G/T, 4 C/G and 3 A/T. The conversion rate was higher than the transversion rate because the cytosine residue CpG dinucleotide is the most frequently mutated sites in the genome. Most of them are methylated, and can spontaneously deaminate resulting in the formation of thymine, which is consistent with the reported results.</p>
<p>The sequence length of MHC-DRB1 exon2 is 270bp, and it can be translated into 89 amino acids. Amino acid sequence analysis showed there were twenty-three mutations causing amino acid changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), eight nonsense-mutations and three sense-mutations. For Chinese Merino sheep MHC-DRB1 exon2 of allelic gene sequences of amino acid homology analysis, the homology was more than 81&#x0025;. The results reflected the consistent with MHC-DRB1 nucleotide polymorphism loci.</p>

<p>The MHC-DRB1 exon2 sequences of different sheep breeds were aligned through GenDoc software. The results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) demonstrated that in different studies, the number of SNPs and SAPs were different. However, in the majority of studies between 50&#x0025; and 70&#x0025; of SNPs caused amino acid changed. The current study was at the upper limit of this range whereby 30 out of 41 (73&#x0025;) SNPs resulted in amino acid changes.</p>

<p>In this study, the polymorphism of MHC-DRB1 gene exon2 associated with Brucellosis susceptibility, the result of analysis found that MHC-DRB1 was likely to be one of the genes associated with Brucellosis susceptibility, C&#x003E;T alleles at the 109 locus in the case-control samples distribution existed significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.05), and preliminary analysis suggested that MHC-DRB1 exon2 109 C&#x003E;T associated with Brucellosis susceptibility. Association analysis was conducted for each genotype of the gene polymorphisms, showing that the site of DD/Dd/dd genotype in the case-control samples distribution had no significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x003E;0.05).</p>
<p>Haplotypes generally had more information content than individual SNPs. Therefore, we performed linkage disequilibrium(LD) and haplotype analysis for the SNPs with MAFs&#x003C;5&#x0025; and the genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.001) in Chinese Merino sheep. The standardized measure of LD denoted as D&#x2019; were calculated for all pairs of SNPs. Among forty-one SNPs in MHC-DRB1 exon2, only twenty-nine SNPs were eligible, and were used to analyze LD in both case and control, the haplotypes LD map as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, indicated the LD of the SNPs, the number in box such as 99 is 0.99, the greater D&#x2019; value means the stronger LD degree between each two SNPs, D&#x2019;&#x003E;0.9 is usually considered highly LD, and D&#x2019;&#x003E;0.7 is deemed to the two SNPs located in same block, which can perform haplotypes analysis. The block diagram of color from light to deep (white and red), said the LD degree from low to high, deep red means completely linkage. LD analysis found that the MHC-DRB1 exon2 had nine LD Blocks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>), and each two SNPs had strong LD in every Block.</p>

<p>Due to a series of genetic diseases are often not caused by a single SNP loci, but by the combination of SNPs on several sites, therefore, in the study of disease association analysis, based on the multiple sites of SNPs studies tend to have more strength and more convincing than a single SNP loci. Because haplotype frequency cannot less than 0.03 in a population, the haplotype combination which frequency yet reached 0.03 should be ignored during statistics, so that only nine haplotype combinations were analyzed in the MHC-DRB1 exon2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>), the result of analysis found that Hap8 and Hap9 these two haplotypes frequency in the case group was 12.5&#x0025; and 15&#x0025; respectively, was significantly higher than control group, haplotype frequency distribution difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.05), initially speculated that these two haplotypes may associated with Brucellosis susceptibility.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A high degree of polymorphism and base mutation are a very prominent feature of vertebrate MHC genes, having become a hot research topic in livestock resistance breeding. Forty-one SNPs in MHC-DRB1 gene exon2 of Chinese Merino sheep observed in this study are newly identified and have not been reported previously. These results confirmed that PCR-SSCP is a useful tool for easy and efficient identification of DNA polymorphisms and can be employed for evaluating genetic variability in large livestock populations. Furthermore, according to the previously study about SNPs and SAPs, the results fully demonstrated that MHC-DRB1 gene of Chinese Merino sheep is really highly polymorphic.</p>
<p>Compared with other varieties sheep polymorphic in MHC-DRB1 gene exon2, there were a lot of differences in different breeds of sheep. The discrepancy in different populations was probably caused by the following reasons: one the one hand, some polymorphisms can only be preserved and inherited in ancient and special animals. On the other hand, different selection purpose and selection history lead to the diversity.</p>
<p>The main function of MHC is antigen presentation, playing a very important role in the immune system of animal body, and it has a close relationship with the livestock disease susceptibility. Many disease susceptibility are associated with MHC, as a candidate gene for disease susceptibility has become one of the research hotspots in modern molecular immune genetic. Through the study of the association between SNPs and the Brucellosis susceptibility, the 109 C&#x003E;T was found to be significantly associated with Brucellosis susceptibility, which provide scientific basis for choice Brucellosis susceptibility molecular marker-assisted, genetic loci for further search with susceptibility and lay the foundation for genetic breeding, but about whether the 109 C&#x003E;T as genetic markers of Brucellosis, also need to attack toxic experiment will be carried out to further verify. After further verification, this SNP could be a useful molecular marker for use in poultry breeding.</p>
<p>In case and control association studies, when LD exists in each two SNP, haplotypes generally had more information content than individual SNPs. This study calculated the degree of LD and inferred haplotype using SHEsis online software. Because of LD of SNPs in very close genetic distance, but in order to successfully identify may lead to changes in the disease, many relational analysis method using multiple high density SNPs sites to study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Epstein and Satten, 2003</xref>), on the other hand, haplotype is just a collection of closely linked SNPs on the same chromosome allele, it contains a number of pairwise LD information, so the gene location problem, based on haplotype association are more powerful than based on single SNP loci analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Zaykin et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The haplotype analysis found that nine haplotypes were constructed by using twenty-nine SNPs, if LD did not exist between each two SNPs, twenty-nine SNPs should produce 2<sup>29</sup> haplotypes, but only nine haplotypes were detected among these SNPs in this study because of strong LD. In addition, we also investigated haplotype frequencies between case and control in Chinese Merino sheep, and speculated that Hap8 and Hap9 may associated with the Brucellosis susceptibility which may relate to immune traits association studies and lay the foundation for molecular marker assisted selection. Further studies as well as functional analysis are required to fully elucidate how these interesting gene polymorphisms may affect MHC-DRB1 gene exon2 activity and/or probably act as candidate markers associated with Brucellosis susceptibility in sheep.</p>

<p>Following PCR-SSCP analysis, PCR amplification products were recycled and purified by an agarose gel purification kit to enable identification of different genotypes for each individual. Recycled DNA fragments were attached to the pMD19-T vector, and transformed into TOP10 E.coli competent cells on LB plates coated with Amp. Clones were inoculated onto the culture medium containing Amp and allowed to culture. Thus, the bacteria were used as a template for PCR amplification to identify recombinant clones. If they were amplified completely consistently with the objective fragment, they were identified as positive clones. Bacteria containing positive clones were sent to BGI, Beijing, for sequencing.

<p>The genotypic frequency of SNPs from the MHC-DRB1 gene exon2 were analyzed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in case and control Chinese Merino sheep using chi-squared with a significance level of <italic>P</italic>=0.001. Comparisons of allelic and genotypic frequencies in case-control groups and association analysis between the polymorphisms and Brucellosis susceptibility were undertaken using SHEsis software.</p>

<title>Linkage disequilibrium and Haplotype analysis</title>
<p>SNPs whose minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were &#x003C;5&#x0025;, failed genotyping due to technical errors, or failed to meet Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.001) were removed from the haplotype structure. The pattern of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs was measured by the LD coefficient D&#x2019;=D/Dmax., The magnitude of LD between matching sites was used to indicate whether or not LD existed. The value of D&#x2019; was calculated by the online genetics software SHEsis. This software tests the HWE of the sample population, analyses LD of large samples while testing for multiple SNP loci at the same time and constructs haplotype associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Yong and Lin, 2005</xref>).</p>
