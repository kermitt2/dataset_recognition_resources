<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution. LSM is employed either in combination with tissue clearing to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the entire mouse brain or with intrinsically transparent samples like zebrafish larvae for functional imaging. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects cause stripe artifacts, which obscure features of interest and, during functional imaging, modulate fluorescence variations related to neuronal activity. Here, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data. Furthermore, using Bessel beams, we demonstrate a fivefold increase in sensitivity to calcium transients and a 20 fold increase in accuracy in the detection of activity correlations in functional imaging. Our results demonstrate the contamination of data by systematic and random errors through Gaussian illumination and furthermore quantify the increase in fidelity of such data when using Bessel beams.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The brain is an immensely complex entity in which structure and function are intricately correlated and best elucidated on a organ-wide scale at cellular resolution. One technique, which is particularly suited for whole-brain investigations, is light-sheet microscopy (LSM) <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Siedentopf and Zsigmondy (1902)</xref>)</italic></bold> due to its intrinsic optical sectioning capabilities, fast acquisition rates and low photobleaching. In LSM, fluorescence is excited in a thin sheet of excitation light that coincides with the focal plane of a perpendicularly placed detection objective <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huisken et al. (2004)</xref>)</italic></bold>. By combining advanced tissue clearing methods <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richardson and Lichtman (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Silvestri et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tainaka et al. (2016)</xref>)</italic></bold> with LSM, neuronal and vascular cyto-architecture can be reconstructed over cm-sized samples like the entire mouse brain <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dodt et al. (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Susaki et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pan et al. (2016)</xref>)</italic></bold> for quantitative structural studies. On the functional side, LSM, paired with intrinsically transparent samples like zebrafish larvae, has yielded fast volumetric calcium activation maps over the entire encephalon <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vladimirov et al. (2014)</xref>).</italic></bold></p>
<p>Despite its intrinsic advantages, the very nature of uncoupled, perpendicular optical pathways for fluorescence excitation and detection entails a different set of drawbacks unique to LSM. Previously published studies (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al. (2016)</xref>)</italic></bold> have shown that refractive heterogeneities, always present to some extent even in extremely well clarified or intrinsically transparent samples, lead to a loss of spatial resolution and a concomitant degradation in sensitivity and contrast. Particular to LSM are dark shadows that appear whenever the fluorescence-exciting light sheet is interrupted by scattering or absorbing obstacles. At best, these dark shadows severely affect image homogeneity, at worst, they completely obscure any feature of interest in their path. Considering the increasingly large dataset sizes routinely produced in high-throughput light-sheet microscopy, high demands are placed on the automated tools to count, trace or segment the fluorescent features of interest. Consequently, background uniformity and indeed high-fidelity imaging are paramount to facilitate the extraction of meaningful insights from terabytes of data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the obstacles that obstruct the light sheet are not static, their shadows dynamically modulate the fluorescence intensity, causing an artifact here termed &#x201C;flickering&#x201D;. For example, haemodynamic absorption <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al. (2016)</xref>)</italic></bold> of the light sheet can be particularly problematic for <bold><italic>in-vivo</italic></bold> Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-imaging where the variation of fluorescence signal over time quantifies neuronal activity. We hypothesize that artifacts due to streaky shadows are non-negligible and cause loss or corruption of data obtained in light-sheet microscopy experiments. This premise is supported by a previous functional study in zebrafish which had to manually exclude neurons affected by severe flickering from further analysis <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Panier et al. (2013)</xref>).</italic></bold> We argue that dynamic flickering constitutes an inherent source of artifact potentially falsifying quantitative data obtained in light-sheet microscopy experiments and therefore any theory inferred from such observations might have to be questioned.</p>
<p>Aiming for an optical solution to streaking artifacts, here, we apply Bessel beams <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Durnin et al. (1987)</xref>,</italic></bold> see box 1) to LSM to investigate biological samples for high-fidelity interrogation of their structure or function. Using a direct comparative analysis between Bessel and Gaussian illumination we provide supporting evidence and quantification of artifacts introduced by Gaussian illumination and further demonstrate that Bessel beams provide superior accuracy and sensitivity.</p>

<title>Streaking artifacts obscure microscopic features of interest</title>
<p>In this section we present the effects of streaking artifacts in structural imaging aimed at obtaining cellular-resolution maps of the anatomy over the intact clarified mouse brain in two case studies, firstly targeting neurons and secondly, targeting the vasculature. It is apparent that in all images obtained using Gaussian illumination image homogeneity is strongly affected and dark shadows obscure microscopic anatomical features of interest. Notably those same identical features remain clearly visible when using Bessel beam illumination.</p>
<p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></italic> summarizes shadowing artifacts in neuronal imaging demonstrated on an axial section (maximum intensity projection of 20 &#x03BC;m) of an intact Thyl-GFP-M mouse brain imaged with Gaussian illumination <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-a</xref>)</italic></bold> using a custom-made LSM (supplementary <bold><italic>Figure 6</italic></bold>). Dark horizontal shadows traverse each brain half and are further illustrated in an inset detailing the hippocampus <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-b</xref>)</italic></bold>. Note, that each half of the intact brain is illuminated from its respective side. By contrast, the same area acquired with Bessel beam illumination <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-c</xref>)</italic></bold> shows improved image homogeneity and the absence of strong shadowing. In order to quantify the extent of the area affected by streaking artifacts, we calculated the line profiles obtained over the entire height of the image for Gauss and Bessel illumination respectively <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-d</xref>)</italic></bold> and further binarized their absolute difference <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-e</xref></italic></bold>) with respect to a user-selected threshold to obtain a pattern similar to a bar code. By superimposing this bar pattern to the original image <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1-f</xref>)</italic></bold> the percentage of 2D area affected by streaking artifacts was estimated. Averaged over a slab encompassing the entire brain over a depth of 400 &#x03BC;m (stitched from image stacks with step size 2 &#x03BC;m, threshold 5 &#x0025;) we calculated that 37.5 &#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.2 &#x0025; (standard error of mean, SEM) of the images were affected by streaking.</p>

Broadly speaking this signifies that while 87&#x0025; of the image content present in the Gaussian channel was also present in the Bessel channel only 62&#x0025; of the image content present in the Bessel channel had corresponding content in the Gaussian channel.</p>

<title>Dynamic flickering falsifies functional traces</title>
<p>The previous section described the deleterious effect of static shadows on structural data extracted from LSM images over the entire and intact mouse brain. In the following we consider functional imaging in zebrafish where neuronal activity is quantified by a relative change in fluorescence of the calcium indicator with respect to a baseline value. Additionally to previously discussed static shadows also present in intrinsically transparent zebrafish larva <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-a-d</xref></italic></bold>), dynamic shadowing caused by the movement of red blood cells leads to a fluctuation of this baseline, here termed flickering. The following images were acquired using a custom-built light-sheet microscope <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>)</italic></bold> which provided cellular resolution over the entire encephalon within one field of view. As early as three days post fertilization (dpf), fully formed blood vessels <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-e-g</xref></italic></bold>, green arrow heads) can be easily distinguished by the flow of individual blood cells (red arrow heads). Haemodynamic absorption and scattering represents a multiplicative noise source <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ma et al. (2016)</xref>)</italic></bold> and therefore has the potential to modulate significantly the sensitivity to fluorescence variations related to neuronal activity in adjacent neurons (white arrow heads). A projection of the standard deviation for &#x2248; 100 ns of the trace <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-f</xref></italic></bold>) clearly evidences blood vessels by superimposing the trajectories of blood cells and further highlights the strong variations in gray values in corresponding adjacent regions <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-g</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<p>In this section we evaluate to which extent flickering potentially masks or even falsifies neuronal activity when using Gaussian illumination.

<title>Haemodynamic baseline contamination</title>
<p>Due to the irregular flow of blood cells, the traversing excitation light sheet is either absorbed or scattered out of its trajectory such that the baseline fluorescence in adjacent neurons is no longer steadily generated. In the following, dF/F traces of pairwise identical neurons, imaged with either a Gaussian or Bessel beam, located in areas affected by strong flickering and located as described in the previous section, were compared. Larvae were treated with tricaine (160 mg I<sup>-1</sup>), a commonly used general anesthetic to globally lower neuronal activity <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Attili and Hughes (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Turrini et al. (2017)</xref>),</italic></bold> to ensure that any changes in baseline fluorescence were only due to dynamic flickering and not neuronal activity. A transversal section of the encephalon of a 4 dpf Tg(elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s) zebrafish larva is shown in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-a,b</xref></italic></bold>. Three representative neurons are marked with red (cyan) circles for the Gaussian (Bessel) case and their dF/F traces are shown in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-c</xref></italic></bold>. Different positions in the encephalon display different levels of baseline noise; however, in general, the noise obtained in Bessel traces was consistently lower than that in traces obtained with Gaussian illumination. Quantified by their standard deviation, we analyzed traces measured with Gaussian and Bessel beam illumination respectively to obtain the level of baseline noise in the absence of neuronal activity <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-d</xref></italic></bold>). The baseline noise was 19.65 &#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.18 &#x0025; of dF/F for Gaussian and 3 .90 &#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.07 &#x0025; for Bessel beam illumination (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001, paired t-test, n&#x003D;625 cells, 15 time lapses at various depths in N&#x003D;7 larvae of 4-5 dpf, error is sem) constituting a five fold increase in sensitivity.</p>

<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Statistical analysis of reduced sensitivity and accuracy</title>
<p>The previously reported increase in baseline noise directly reduces the sensitivity to calcium transients. In this section, using statistical arguments, we quantify the loss in peak detection and activity correlation due to time-varying haemodynamic flickering.</p>
<p>Exemplary traces in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-e</xref></italic></bold> illustrate a peak counting routine (see methods <bold><italic>subsection</italic></bold>) which counted peaks above Gaussian baseline noise (red triangles) and again above Bessel beam baseline noise (cyan triangles) on identical traces obtained with Bessel beam illumination. Peaks of sub-threshold prominence (black arrow head) were discarded. The total number of peaks per minute detected above their respective baseline noise levels are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-f</xref>(<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001, paired t-test, n&#x003D;586 cells, in N&#x003D;1 larva, error is sem). The cells were located at 12 different depths throughout the encephalon of a 4dpf larva. Whereas on average 6.6 peaks per minute could be detected above Bessel beam noise levels, only 0.5 peaks per minute were high enough to surpass the Gaussian baseline noise. This means that, statistically, if a given cell were to be located in an area affected by strong flickering, then less than 1 out of 12 peaks would be detected due to the higher associated baseline noise when using Gaussian compared to Bessel beam illumination.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the influence of increased baseline noise on dF/F traces, we generated random white noise of an amplitude corresponding to the Gaussian and Bessel baseline noise respectively, and multiplied it pairwise to traces obtained with Bessel beam illumination, see supplementary <bold><italic>Figure 10.</italic></bold> The native data set without synthetic noise was considered as ground truth and allowed an absolute comparison between Gaussian and Bessel beam illumination. The absolute cross correlation coefficients reported in supplementary <bold><italic>Figure 10-e</italic></bold> reveal that while the mean of the Gaussian and native data set differ significantly (0.0978 vs 0.1309), the difference between the mean of the Bessel and the native data set is not statistically significant (0.1308 vs 0.1309) (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001, t-test, n&#x003D; 277885 corresponding to 746 cells in N&#x003D;1 larva, error is too small to be displayed). Next, the difference in cross correlation coefficients between the native traces and the traces with synthetic noises was calculated (supplementary <bold><italic>Figure</italic></bold> 10-f,i). The histograms of these distributions give some important insights; whereas the mean value represents the bias of each modality, the standard deviation gives a measure of its accuracy. For Gaussian illumination, we obtained a mean value of 0.0127 (supplementary <bold><italic>Figure</italic></bold> 10-g) whereas this value is 5.29E-5 for Bessel beam illumination (supplementary <bold><italic>Figure</italic></bold> 10-j). This result matters, because it indicates the introduction of a systematic error by Gaussian illumination which is approximately one tenth of the average absolute correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the standard deviations of the histograms give a direct measure of the random error introduced by each method and therefore a measure of accuracy. The standard deviation was 0.0682 for Gaussian and 0.0033 for Bessel beam illumination <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-g</xref>)</italic></bold> which constitutes an 20-fold increase in accuracy compared to Gaussian illumination.</p>

<title>Real neuronal connectivity is masked by spurious correlation</title>
<p>The previous section evaluated the reduction of sensitivity from a statistical point of view by distinguishing peaks with respect to numerical thresholds and by including baseline noise of typical amplitude both obtained by averaging hundreds of cells affected by flickering. We showed that the contamination with both systematic and random errors is significantly higher when using Gaussian beam compared to Bessel beams. In the final section, we present measurements of spontaneous neuronal activity in individual cells in the presence of flickering.</p>
<p>As indicated in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-h</xref></italic></bold>, several cells have been manually selected in the hindbrain of a 4dpf larva to generate a scenario in which spurious correlations due to flickering significantly alter the correlation amongst cells in a circuit. The red and blue cells where chosen in an area determined by the methodology described in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3-h</xref></italic></bold> and corresponded to lines in which nearby flowing blood cells cast alternating shadows whereas the yellow cells have been randomly chosen among a circuit of cells that showed strong spontaneous activity (see supplementary movies 24 and 25). It is apparent from the correlation matrix <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-i</xref></italic></bold>) that, when using Gaussian illumination, a strong correlation between cells on one line (sector marked <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="230540_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the correlation matrix) can be observed which strongly anti-correlates with cells from the line immediately next to it <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="230540_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, an obvious haemodynamic artifact. Notably when using Bessel beam illumination this strong spurious correlation is not observed (average cross correlation &#x002D;0.571 &#x00B1; 0.025 for Gauss versus &#x002D;0.013 &#x00B1; 0.023 for Bessel beam illumination, n&#x003D;55, error is sem, see table in supplementary <bold><italic>Figure 11</italic></bold>). Exemplary traces of spontaneous activity outside an area strongly affected by flickering (cells marked yellow) are shown in <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4-j</xref></italic></bold>. It is worthwhile pointing out, that when looking at correlations entirely outside flickering areas <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="230540_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, average correlation obtained with Gaussian beams was 0.576 &#x00B1; 0.020 and 0.660 &#x00B1; 0.017 (an increase of 15 &#x0025;, n&#x003D;91) for Bessel beams. This result is important because it demonstrates that even when steering clear of problematic areas with evident strong flickering, correlations of neuronal activity can be significantly affected by residual flickering when using Gaussian illumination.</p>

<title>Structural imaging</title>
<p>A particular interest in the neuroscience community is to map quantitative data of the whole mouse brain onto common atlases, a task for which light-sheet microscopy is particularly well suited once the mouse brain has been appropriately rendered transparent. Due to the high frame rates obtainable with LSM, whole mouse brain data sets now routinely comprise several terabytes, a size which demands automated tools (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frasconi et al. (2014)</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peng et al. (2017)</xref>)</italic></bold> to count, trace or segment features of interest either to obtain cyto-architectonic information over a mouse brain-wide scale or in the emerging field of digital 3D histology <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Torres et al. (2013)</xref>)</italic></bold> to provide automated interpretation of images used for quantitative diagnosis <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bucur et al. (2015)</xref>).</italic></bold> Isolating fluorescent features of interest in a heterogeneous background places higher computational demands on the algorithms used, often with concurrent increase in computation time and complexity of the parameters to be tuned. A recent study showed that very simple algorithms like global thresholding or high pass filtering require uniform background intensity and fail to segment simple fluorescent forms like cell nuclei when a striated background simulating muscle fibers is added to the image <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chitalia et al. (2016)</xref>).</italic></bold> As the complexity of the fluorescent feature increases, so do the demands on the algorithms tasked to isolate them. For instance, neuron tracing is a fundamental tool to understand neuronal morphology and function, however, the accurate segmentation of neurons is to date a challenging task due to their often complex arborization and the varying quality of microscope images <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acciai et al. (2016)</xref>).</italic></bold></p>
<p>Another recent study compared automated segmentation of a simple synthetic interrupted tube with progressively added salt and pepper noise by a range of published algorithm and their failure to accurately trace this simulated neurite at noise levels of five percent <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu etal. (2016)</xref>).</italic></bold> In <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>,</italic></bold> we show how a threshold of 5 &#x0025; leads to more than a third of the image encompassing half a mouse brain to be affected by a striated background, putting at risk hours of microscope acquisition time, days of data post-processing and weeks of sample preparation. In <bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold> we have shown that, due to shadowing, image content, especially of finer vessels illuminated with a Gaussian beam, can drop to little above 40 &#x0025; compared to data acquired with Bessel beam illumination, again jeopardizing entire terabyte-sized datasets. By contrast, the quality of the data sets obtained with Bessel beam illumination allowed, for example, the automated segmentation of blood vessels by simple thresholding in areas completely obscured by shadows using Gaussian illumination.</p>

<title>Functional imaging</title>
<p>Large-scale neuronal recordings and their interpretation have been a paradigm shift towards understanding circuit function during behavior <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahrens et al. (2012)</xref>).</italic></bold> With substantial improvements in imaging technology and a concurrent increase in the size and complexity of neuronal data, pressure now shifts towards data analysis as a fundamental bottleneck for neuroscience <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freeman et al. (2014)</xref>).</italic></bold> A common approach in large-scale imaging in zebrafish larvae is to apply an automatic segmentation algorithms which identifies ROIs associated with individual neurons <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Panier et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kawashima et al. (2016)</xref>)</italic></bold> and extracts the df/f traces from the contained pixel values. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the contamination of data by artifacts created by haemodynamic flickering that threaten the automated extraction of calcium transients over the entire larva encephalon. Here, we have shown a reduction of the flickering area by a factor of &#x2248; 30 when using Bessel beam illumination. Whereas a previous publication <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Panier et al. (2013)</xref>)</italic></bold> manually excluded severely affected neurons from further analysis, using Bessel beams would allow to include substantially more cells in a move from large-scale imaging towards true brain-wide analysis.</p>
<p>The deleterious effect of flickering artifacts caused by passing blood cells has been previously reported <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Panier et al. (2013)</xref>)</italic></bold> but not quantified. Here, we present a statistical analysis to estimate the baseline noise associated haemodynamic modulation in most adversely affected neurons and report a STD of &#x2248; 20 &#x0025; df/f for Gaussian illumination compared to &#x2248; 4 &#x0025; for Bessel beams. This represents a 5-fold increase in sensitivity to accurately reveal Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> transients when using Bessel beam illumination that otherwise would have been buried in noise. It is worth pointing out that these values represent a worst-case scenario; in the best case, at least in 2D studies, the plane of interest contains no or very little vessels and therefore no flickering and consequently the baseline noise in Gaussian and Bessel beam are identical. For true 3D brain-wide acquisitions however, it will be impossible to fully avoid haemodynamic contamination.</p>
<p>To illustrate the effect of increased baseline noise, we have presented a statistical analysis applying peak counting and cross correlation to identical traces. By counting peaks due to spontaneous neuronal activity above the Gaussian baseline noise and the Bessel baseline noise we estimated that less than 1 out of 12 peaks would be detected. This is a conservative estimate since usually higher thresholds of signal to noise ratio (SNR), e.g. Rose criterion: SNR&#x003D;5 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rose (1973)</xref>),</italic></bold> are common. Furthermore, using synthetic white noise, we have demonstrated that the randomizing effect of haemodynamic noise leads to a loss of correlation which cannot be hoped to be recovered by clever engineering of ever brighter calcium indicators due to its multiplicative nature.</p>
<p>Blood flow in the brain is regulated to match neuronal demand based on activity by restricting and dilating the diameter of vessels, a phenomenon known as neurovascular coupling <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attwell et al. (2010)</xref>).</italic></bold> Assuming Hagen-Poiseuille law of fluidic dynamics, this results in varying volumetric flow rates and therefore speeds of red blood cells. This plus other randomizing effects like vessel orientation and location means that neurons more than just a few cell diameters away from each other experience entirely uncorrelated noise. More strikingly however, the opposite is true as well: neurons which lie in close proximity on a line parallel to the excitation light will experience a baseline noise that is very strongly correlated and capable of generating spurious correlations that are not due to activity. Playing the devil&#x2018;s advocate, we &#x201C;created&#x201D; a correlation matrix in which the positive correlation between cells on one line and their anti-correlation with cells on a neighboring line were so strong as to mask actual correlation due to activity in an area not severely affected by flickering. This result is important because it shows that not only do Bessel beams reduce the area affected by strong flickering in which they also generate a significantly lower baseline noise. Additionally, even in areas that are not strongly affected by flickering due to immediately close by vessels, Bessel beams reveal neuronal activity that is lost when using Gaussian illumination.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have illustrated how flickering can adversely affect and even falsify data extracted from LSM images. We compared the performance of Gaussian and Bessel beam illumination in structural and functional studies, covering brain-wide morphology of neuronal and vascular networks in clarified mouse brains and Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> imaging in larval zebrafish. We have identified sources of contamination in the form of true correlation lost in a multiplicative baseline noise and spurious correlation overpowering correlation due to actual neuronal activity when using standard illumination. We have shown how the use of Bessel beams can provide an optical solution to correct for these artifacts on the microscope system side and allow for high-fidelity imaging in light-sheet microscopes. The results presented here redefine the quality standard for quantitative measurements in LSM with a single neuron sensitivity that opens up a new class of experimental studies.</p>

(2015)</xref>),</italic></bold> was used for all structural imaging experiments (see supplementary <bold><italic>Figure</italic> 6</bold>). In essence, the microscope is equipped with an alternative excitation light path using two flip mirrors which directed the light towards an axicon (AX252-A, <bold><italic>a</italic></bold> &#x003D; 2&#x00B0;, Thorlabs, Newton, USA) to generate a Bessel beam. The Bessel beam was filtered in a Fourier plane with a circular spatial filter to eliminate any residual Gaussian contribution. The Gaussian or Bessel beam respectively is split by a polarizing beam splitter and subsequently scanned by two galvo mirrors (6220H, Cambridge Technology, Bedford, USA) to create a double-sided illumination light sheet. The excitation objectives (Plan Fluor EPI, 10x, 0.3NA, WD 17.5 mm, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), covered with a protective coverslip, project the light sheet into the focal plane of the perpendicularly placed detection objective (XLPLN10XSVMP, 10x,0.6NA, WD 12mm, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) specifically designed for immersion in high-refractive index media and featured a correction collar for the refractive index of the immersion solution, ranging from 1.33 to 1.52. A tube lens forms an image onto the sensor of a fast sCMOS camera (Orca Flash4.0 v2.0, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu city, Japan) whose line by line readout is synchronized to each step of the galvo mirrors to achieve confocal line detection. Appropriate filters are used to bandpass filter the fluorescence and reject excitation light. For vasculature imaging, excitation was &#x03BB;&#x003D; 561 nm and an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTFnC-400.650-TN, AA Opto-Electronic, France) was used to regulate laser power.

<p>A custom-made light-sheet microscope <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7-a</xref>)</italic></bold>, specifically designed for <bold><italic>in-vivo</italic></bold> imaging of zebrafish larva, was used for all functional imaging experiment. In brief, a 488 nm continuous-wave diode-pump solid state laser (Excelsior, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, USA) with 3 mW output power was used as light source and an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF) was used as a shutter and power regulator. Two different illumination paths could be selected by the use of flip mirrors. The first illumination path, expands the output of the laser onto a galvanometric mirror (galvo, 6220H, Cambridge Technology, Bedford, USA). The galvo is re-imaged with a 4f telescope onto the back aperture of the excitation objective (4x, 0.13 NA, air immersion, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The excitation objective focused the illumination beam into the sample chamber and by applying a sawtooth waveform to the galvo the beam was rapidly scanned to form a static light sheet which coincided with the focal plane of a perpendicularly placed detection objective (20x, 1 NA, water immersion, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The sample was mounted on an x-, y-, z-, &#x0398;-stage (M-122.2DD and M-116.DG, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) which allowed its precise positioning and the acquisition of z-stacks. Fluorescence was detected in a wide-field scheme with a tube lens forming an image onto the chip of a sCMOS camera (OrcaFlash4.0, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu city, Japan). Appropriate filters are used to bandpass filter the fluorescence and reject excitation light. The camera was operated in rolling shutter mode thereby creating a virtual confocal slit. In the second illumination path a telescope adjusted the beam diameter of the Gaussian beam before the axicon (AX251-A, <bold><italic>&#x03B1;</italic></bold> &#x003D; 1&#x00B0;, Thorlabs, Newton, USA) to minimize the Gaussian contribution produced by the round tip. The self-reconstruction length of the resulting Bessel beam was then re-imaged with 3 additional lenses, each placed at 2f from each other respectively, into the common Gaussian light path. A circular spatial filter was used close to a Fourier plane near the galvo to filter out any residual Gaussian contribution to the Bessel beam. A heating system kept the sample chamber at a constant temperature of 28.5 &#x00B0;C. The microscope was controlled via custom software written in LabVIEW 2012 (National Instruments, Austin, USA) using the Murmex library (Distrio, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).</p>

The glass capillary was then mounted onto an x-, y-, z-, &#x0398;-stage (M-122.2DD and M-116.DG, Physik Instrumente, Germany) and immediately immersed into the sample chamber containing fish water. The fish water was kept at a constant temperature of 28.5 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<title>Calcium imaging</title>
<p>For <bold><italic>in-vivo</italic></bold> Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> imaging a line exposure time of 0.3 ms was used, resulting in a frame rate of 44 Hz. When using Bessel beam illumination, power was increased by a factor of three compared to Gaussian illumination. The 16bit depths images constituting each time lapse were first converted from the proprietary Hamamatsu file format to a multi-page tiff and simultaneously temporally down sampled by a factor of <bold>8</bold> to save disc space resulting in an effective frame rate of 5.5 Hz. When tricaine was added to the fish water and the traces therefore were used to analyze flickering, no temporal downsampling was performed. Z profles of regions of interests were then extracted with a FIJI macro over a hand selected circular area covering the cell nucleus. The &#x0394;f/f traces were obtained with a custom-written Matlab script in which, firstly, the background was subtracted and secondly, the baseline of the traces were calculated using the <bold><italic>msbackadj</italic></bold> function. Thirdly, the baseline was subtracted from the trace and finally, the trace was divided by the baseline to normalize it <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freeman et al.

<title>Estimation of the area affected by flickering</title>
<p>The area affected by primary flickering for Gaussian and Bessel beam illumination was estimated in a two dimensional plane by using a sequence of custom-made macros (FIJI) and programs (LabVIEW). By primary flickering is intended strong variations in baseline fluorescence intensity directly attributable to a large, nearby blood vessel. The more subtle, yet noticeable, effect of smaller peripheral blood vessels was neglected as it was much harder to quantify. Using this automated method 2D maps of severe flickering areas were obtained which allowed us to calculate the percentage of the entire encephalon that were prone to a substantial source of additive noise. To assure that the evidenced changes in pixel brightness were not due to activity, Tricaine (160 mg l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), a general anesthetic that blocks voltage sensitive Na&#x002B; channels preferentially in neurons, was added to the fish water.</p>
<p>The methodology <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref></italic></bold>), based predominantly on a temporally down-sampled time lapse in which each frame corresponded to the standard deviation (STD) of a certain frame window of the original raw data, evidenced the characteristic shape of long horizontal stripes. A custom-written FIJI macro was used to calculate the STD time lapse of the raw data time lapse with window size 5 and step size 5. After adjusting both time lapses to the same brightness scale, an additional macro automatically compared the STD time lapses of the Gaussian and Bessel beam by running through a sequence of functions to enhance the features of the images that changed most in brightness value using the exact same parameters in both cases. With both time lapses displayed on the same brightness scale, first a gamma of 1.1, second a bandpass filter (settings from FIJI:) and third a variance filter (settings from FIJI:) were applied over the entire image. After again adjusting both time lapses to the same brightness scale, each time lapse was collapsed to a single image using using a z projection of the STD. The resulting images were thresholded to a common value and converted to 8 bit binary where dark spots indicating the parts of the encephalon that had changed the most during high frame rate (44 Hz) acquisition. The binary images where then analyzed in a custom-written LabVIEW program that automatically found the bounding boxes of each identified particle (LabVIEW function and settings:) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref></italic></bold>). In the case of Gaussian illumination, the horizontal dimension of the bounding box of each particle was extended up to a mask corresponding to the free-hand selection of the encephalon of the larva. In the case of the Bessel beam illumination, the bounding box was extended to a length corresponding to the theoretically calculated reconstruction length of the Bessel beam which follows from simple trigonometric considerations:

where <bold><italic>&#x03B2;</italic></bold> is the angle of the cone in the sample chamber, and <bold><italic>h</italic></bold> is the height of the bounding box. The LabVIEW program then automatically calculated the sum of all bounding boxes and their percentile of the free-hand selection of the entire encephalon. The characteristic horizontal stripes of the resulting areas, confirmed that the method indicated primarily shadowing artifacts and not individual neuronal activity.</p>

<title>Box 1. Bessel beams</title>
<p>The paraxial Helmholtz equation governs diffraction phenomena and, most typically, its solution describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the form of Gaussian beams. However, alternative solutions exist in the form of diffraction-free modes, most notably Bessel beams <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Durnin etal. (1987)</xref>)</italic></bold>, whose central core can be extremely narrow without being subject to diffraction (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McGloin and Dholakia (2005)</xref>)</italic></bold>. Due to finite apertures necessarily limiting the realization of such beams experimentally, only Quasi-Bessel beams can be generated for which the propagation invariance holds true over a finite propagation range <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Durnin et al. (1988)</xref>).</italic></bold> A simple way to create a Bessel beam is by superimposing plane waves whose wave vectors lie on a cone using a conical lens <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Indebetouw (1989)</xref>,</italic></bold> Figure <bold><italic>Box</italic></bold>5-a).</p>

<p>Each concentric ring carries approximately the same energy as the central core (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Durnin et al.

(1996)</xref>,</italic></bold> Figure <bold><italic>Box</italic></bold> 5-b), however, the same optical energy is also capable of generating out-of-focus fluorescence. In general, images acquired with a Bessel beam therefore exhibit lower contrast and inferior optical sectioning compared to Gaussian illumination, though confocal line detection <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fahrbach and Rohrbach (2012)</xref>)</italic></bold> ammeliorates signal to background.</p>

<p><bold>a)</bold> A diode laser at 488 nm was used to excite GCaMP6f and an acousto optical tunable filter (AOTF) was used to regulate power. The light sheet was created digitally with a galvanometric mirror (galvo) which was re-imaged onto the back focal plane of the excitation objective (4x, 0.13 NA, air immersion, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence was detected by a water immersion objective (20x, 1 NA, water immersion, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and imaged with a tube lens onto the chip of a fast sCMOS camera. Flip mirrors were used to direct the excitation light into an alternative path with an axicon to generate a Bessel beam. <bold>b)</bold> Sample mounting: zebrafish larvae were embedded in low-melting point agarose and drawn with a syringe into a glass capillary.

<caption><title>Work flow to estimate area severely affected by primary flickering. The first row refers to data obtained with Gaussian illumination while the second row was obtained with Bessel illumination. The raw data stack <bold>(a,f)</bold> was first temporally downsampled by calculating projections of the STD over 5 frame windows. Those STD stacks <bold>(b,g)</bold> were then treated over the entire image to further enhance the flickering areas, evidenced as bright horizontal stripes, using Gamma, Band path filter (BPF) and variance filter. The resulting time lapses <bold>(c,h)</bold> are projected along z to create single STD images, which were adjusted to the same brightness scale before a common threshold was applied to binarize them <bold>(d,i)</bold>. The binary images were then evaluated with a custom-written LabVIEW program to automatically localize the &#x201C;blobs&#x201D;. The bounding boxes (e,j) were used to calculate the overall area affected by flickering. See methods for details.</title>

<caption><title>Extension of bounding boxes. The upper row refers to Gaussian illumination whereas the lower row refers to Bessel beam illumination. The binary image <bold>(a)</bold> obtained from the methodology illustrated in <bold><italic>Figure 8</italic></bold> was loaded into a custom-written LabVIEW program that automatically determined the bounding boxes of each identified particle. The only input of the user was a free-hand selection of the larva encephalon <bold>(b)</bold> that was used for both Bessel and Gauss evaluation. For Gaussian illumination the bounding boxes were horizontally extruded until they reached the limits of the encephalon mask <bold>(c)</bold> whereas for Bessel illumination the bounding box were extended up to a length corresponding to the reconstruction length of the Bessel beam in the sample plane <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref></italic></bold>).

<caption><title>Correlation matrix showing the effect of random synthetic noise. The conceptual flow is as follows: <bold>(a)</bold> from n&#x003D;625 cells with inhibited activity (Tricaine) an average baseline noise was calculated using a pair-wise t-test for Gaussian and Bessel beam illumination respectively <bold>(b)</bold>. This noise level was used as amplitude to generate random white noise <bold>(c)</bold> which was point-wise multiplied to 746 dF/F traces measured with Bessel beam modality <bold>(d)</bold>. By defining the 746 synthetic noise-free traces as ground truth (native), we obtained three data sets that we compared by respective cross correlation. <bold>(e)</bold> Average absolute cross correlation coefficient (ccc) (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001, t-test, n&#x003D; 277885 corresponding to 746 cells, error is sem, NS: not significant). To obtain a measure of accuracy, we subtracted the Gaussian cross correlation coefficients from the native counterparts <bold>(f)</bold>. The histogram of this distribution <bold>(g)</bold> yielded a mean indicating a bias of a measurement made in Gaussian modality, whereas the STD is a measure for its accuracy. <bold>(h)</bold> Correlation matrix showing the native traces (without synthetic noise) in the lower triangular matrix and the traces with multiplied Gaussian noise in the upper triangular matrix. <bold>(i,j,k))</bold> Same as f,g,h) but for Bessel beam modality.</title>
