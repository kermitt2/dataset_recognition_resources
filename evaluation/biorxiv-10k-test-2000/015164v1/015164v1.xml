<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Identification of candidate causal variants in regions associated with risk of common diseases is complicated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple association signals. Nonetheless, accurate maps of these variants are needed, both to fully exploit detailed cell specific chromatin annotation data and highlight disease causal mechanisms and cells, and for design of the functional studies that will ultimately be required to confirm causal mechanisms. We adapted a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm to the fine mapping problem, and demonstrated its improved performance over conventional stepwise and regularised regression through simulation studies. We then applied it to fine map the established multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) associations in the IL-2RA (CD25) gene region. For T1D, both stepwise and stochastic search approaches identified four T1D association signals, with the major effect tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12722496. In contrast, for MS, the stochastic search found two distinct competing models: a single candidate causal variant, tagged by rs2104286 and reported previously using conditional analysis; and a more complex model with two association signals, one of which was tagged by the major T1D associated rs12722496 and the other by rs56382813. There is low to moderate LD between rs2104286 and both rs12722496 and rs56382813 (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x2243; 0.3) and our two SNP model could not be recovered through a forward stepwise search after conditioning on rs2104286. Both signals in the two variant model for MS affect CD25 expression on distinct subpopulations of CD4&#x002B; T cells, which are key cells in the autoimmune process. The results support a shared causal variant for T1D and MS. Our study illustrates the benefit of using a purposely designed model search strategy for fine mapping and the advantage of combining disease and protein expression data.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genome-wide association studies have been very successful at identifying disease-associated variation by exploiting linkage disequilibrium (LD), meaning that only a subset of markers need be surveyed to detect the associations. However, this same LD, particularly when combined with the presence of multiple disease causal variants in relative proximity, makes disentangling the specific causal variants difficult. Mapping the likely causal variants in regions associated with complex traits as precisely as possible is becoming increasingly important for two reasons. Firstly, as detailed chromatin annotations become available, more precise maps of probable causal variants will allow researchers to fully exploit these resources through integrative analyses targeted at identifying the specific genes, molecules and cells underlying disease association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Secondly, the functional studies which are ultimately required to confirm causal mechanisms are laborious and need to focus, from the outset, on the smallest yet most complete set of plausible causal variants.</p>
<p>It is widely recognised that the most associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a region is not necessarily the causal variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], yet attempts at fine mapping disease signals typically proceed by successive conditioning on the most associated SNPs, a form of stepwise regression that may produce incorrect results, particularly when causal variants are correlated, i.e. in linkage disequilibrium (LD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Bayesian methods have been used for fine mapping association signals in dense and imputed genotyping data and generating credible sets of variants that are likely to contain the causal variant, analogous to credible intervals for odds ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. However, these approaches typically make the simplifying assumption that exactly one causal variant exists at any individual region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] because accounting for multiple causal variants leads to exponential increase in the number of models that need to be considered with the number of causal variants considered. Bayesian methods that summarise evidence across SNPs in a region to assess either enrichment of signals in chromatin states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] or colocalisation between association signals for different traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] make a similar single causal variant assumption. As stepwise approaches often obtain evidence for additional, independent association signals in a region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], this assumption is unrealistic. One exception is BimBam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] which can fit multi SNP models, but considers all possible models up to a specified maximum number of causal SNPs. As the number of potential models grows exponentially, BimBam is limited to regions with relatively few SNPs for computational reasons.</p>
<p>Here we adapt a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm, GUESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], to the fine mapping problem. This method, and its fast computational implementation, is tailored to efficiently explore the multimodal space created by multiple SNP models. However, the very dense SNP map that is required for fine mapping leads to extreme LD, which presents two specific challenges for GUESS. The first is that SNPs in extremely tight LD can cause numerical instability in model fitting, so we use minimal tagging to explore the model space and then expand all the tag models selected by GUESS initially (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Second, posterior support is diluted across SNPs in tight LD, potentially preventing direct inference on the importance of individual SNPs. We therefore use posterior model probabilities and patterns of LD to define sets of SNPs which have strong joint posterior support for the hypothesis that one member of the set is causal for the trait. These are analogous to the credible sets generated in the Bayesian fine mapping framework which assumes a single causal variant per region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], but allow for multiple causal variants.</p>

<caption><p>Overview of the fine mapping tailored stochastic search strategy in GUESSFM. 1. SNPs are clustered based on genotype data. Tagging is used to remove cases of extreme LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.99) by selecting one SNP from each cluster (&#x201C;tag set&#x201D;), that which is in highest average LD with all other SNPs. 2. All possible models that can be formed from the tag SNPs may be considered by GUESS. Here, all seven possible models may be considered but, in practice with larger numbers of tags than shown here, GUESS employs a stochastic search strategy to considered only a subset of models, prioritising those with greatest statistical support. 3. GUESS selects the most likely models amongst those it has visited. Here, it selects two of the seven, but in larger data sets we retain the 30,000 most likely. 4. Each of these selected models is expanded by considering all possible substitutions of tags by other members of their tag set. Each expanded model is then assessed again individually, using an approximate Bayes factor.</p></caption>

<p>Our adaptions around GUESS are available in an R package, GUESSFM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chr1swallace/GUESSFM">https://github.com/chr1swallace/GUESSFM</ext-link>). We used GUESSFM to fine map the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) to an established susceptibility region for immune-mediated diseases on chromosome 10p15 (S1 Fig), which contains the candidate causal gene IL2RA. IL2RA encodes a subunit CD25 (IL-2RA) of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor that is essential for the high affinity binding of IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The region has provided some prime examples of evolving genetic research. Initially associated with T1D susceptibility using a candidate gene and tag SNP approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], further studies revealed association to other autoimmune diseases, including MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], and demonstrated that multiple genetic markers were needed to explain the T1D association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Genotype to phenotype studies have demonstrated that disease-associated variants in the region also associate with IL2RA mRNA expression and CD25 protein expression on the surface of naive and memory CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and sensitivity of memory CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T and activated T regulatory cells to IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One challenge for comparative analyses has been the use of different genotyping panels for different diseases. Here, we refined the T1D and MS association signals by taking advantage of a unified dense SNP map provided by the ImmunoChip, a custom Illumina 200K Infinium High-Density array covering 186 distinct autoimmune susceptibility risk regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We used genotypes on a total of 52,637 samples (S1 Table), and supplemented the ImmunoChip variants by imputation into the 1000 Genomes Project data, giving a total of 667 SNPs and small indels with minor allele frequency &#x003E; 0.005 in controls of the T1D- and MS-associated region on chromosome 10p15 for analysis after genotype quality control.</p>
<p>To allow for the effects of LD, traditional conditional regression is often supplemented by identifying subsets of SNPs with some minimum LD (e.g. <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.8) with individual SNPs selected by a forward stepwise procedure, within which it is suggested the causal variant may lie. We compared our proposed approach to traditional conditional regression by simulating phenotypes conditional on multiple &#x201C;causal variants&#x201D; selected randomly from within these genetic data, and confirmed that the proposed approach both recovered a higher proportion of the true effects and simultaneously detected fewer false positive results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). GUESSFM requires specification of the <italic>a priori</italic> expected number of causal variants in a region, <italic>n</italic><sub>exp</sub>. We considered either setting <italic>n</italic><sub>exp</sub> &#x003D; 3 or n<sub>exp</sub> &#x003D; 5, and found the performance decreased when n<sub>exp</sub> was less than the true value, but not when is was greater than the true value, suggesting that for recovery of the correct causal variants it is better to set <italic>n<sub>exp</sub></italic> higher rather than lower. We also considered three regularised regression approaches: the lasso, the elastic net and the group lasso. The ROC curves of those methods (for decreasing penalties) are intermediate to the stepwise and stochastic GUESSFM search approaches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, at traditional optimization thresholds (minimising the ten fold cross validation), regularized regression approaches were extremely anti-conservative, with a very high false discovery rate, compared to stepwise (stopping at <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> or <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>) or GUESSFM for suitable thresholds on posterior probabilities (S2 Table). Picking a regularisation parameter according to the number of predictors included (three or five) produced a more competitive false discovery rate, but discovery rates were still lower than with GUESSFM (S2 Table).</p>

<caption><p>Comparison of of several multivariate methods for fine mapping using simulated data. We simulated quantitative phenotype data with between two and five causal variants using genotype data from the T1D dataset from the <italic>IL2RA</italic> region. The simulated data sets were analysed using forward stepwise regression, GUESSFM, the lasso, the group lasso and the elastic net. The stochastic search produces credible sets for each variant chosen using the snp.picker algorithm described in Materials and Methods. We defined pseudo &#x201C;credible sets&#x201D; for the other approaches as the set of SNPs within <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.8 with an index SNP. We calculated the discovery rate (the proportion of causal variants within at least one credible set, y axis) and false discovery rate (proportion of detected variants whose credible sets did not contain any causal variant, x axis) at different thresholds for the stepwise <italic>p</italic> value, the group marginal posterior probability of inclusion (gMPPI) for GUESSFM and the regularization parameter(s) across simulated datasets (see Methods for details). GUESSFM-3 and GUESSFM-5 refer to GUESSFM run with a prior expectation of three or five causal variants per region, respectively. Results are averaged over 1000 replicates.</p></caption>

<p>We then applied our approach to the MS and T1D data sets. Posterior support for the number of SNPs required to model the association is strongly peaked, favouring a two-SNP model in MS and a four SNP model in T1D (S2 Fig). We summarised inference for SNPs over multiple models by considering the support for a SNP group according to the sum of posterior probabilities (PP) over all models containing a SNP from that group. We term this the group marginal posterior probability of inclusion (gMPPI), which can be understood as the probability that one SNP in that group is causal for the trait of interest. For T1D, there is high confidence (gMPPI &#x003E; 0.8) for four SNP groups that we denote according to their order in S3 Fig: A (indexed by rs12722496), C (rs11594656), E (rs6602437) and F (rs41295159). As the T1D data have previously been analysed using stepwise regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], we compared our results to those found by forward stepwise analysis of the same data (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We saw a direct correspondence in terms of LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.6) between the SNPs identified by the two approaches (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, models found by GUESSFM had larger log likelihoods for a given number of SNPs, indicating that these models offered a better explanation of T1D-associated genetic variation in the region.</p>

<p>In contrast, for MS, there were no SNP groups with high gMPPI. We instead saw two distinct models, which together accounted for &#x003E;80&#x0025; of the posterior support amongst the 514,476 visited models: either model M1, consisting of SNP groups A (indexed by rs12722496) and D (rs56382813), or model M2 consisting only of SNP group B (rs2104286). SNPs from M1 and M2 were rarely selected together (total PP&#x003D;0.039 across the visited models). rs2104286 was reported as the single associated SNP in the region in the original MS ImmunoChip analysis after forward stepwise regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). rs2104286 is in low to moderate LD with both of the M1 index SNPs (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x2243; 0.3, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Haplotype analysis showed that whilst haplotypes carrying the rs2104286:C allele are protective for MS, so is a less common haplotype carrying the rs2104286:T allele and the protective allele at rs56382813 (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Indeed, the addition of rs2104286 to a model consisting of the haplotypes formed by M1 was non-significant (p&#x003D;0.196) whilst the addition of the haplotypes formed by the M1 SNPs to a model consisting of only rs2104286 was significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 2.64 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>). However, the posterior support favours model M1 over M2 only by a factor of 1.7 and this is dependent on our prior expectation for the number of causal variants: had we expected only a single causal variant in the region, we would have favoured M2 by a factor of 1.7, with Ml being favoured only with a prior expectation of 1.8 or more causal variants (S4 Fig). Under any reasonable prior, the posterior support for the two models is so close that we cannot choose between them on statistical evidence alone: we must consider them as plausible alternative explanations for MS association in the region. Note that the Ml SNPs were not within the credible set created under the single causal variant assumption, which consists of rs2104286 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

<p>Since we were unable to distinguish between the competing Ml and M2 models for MS using SNP-disease association data alone, we sought corroborating evidence to support SNPs in either model using CD25 flow cytometric expression data. The M2 SNP rs2104286 has been associated with the age-dependent proportion of na&#x00EF;ve T cells that express CD25 on their cell surface and rsl2722495 (within SNP group A, located in intron 1 of <italic>IL2RA</italic>) with the total expression of CD25 on memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. rsl2722495 has also been associated with <italic>IL2RA</italic> mRNA expression in T cells, both resting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and activated by 48 hour culture with anti-CD3&#x002B;CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We selected a single tag SNP from each of the credible sets and examined which could best explain CD25 protein expression phenotypes using previously published data from 179 samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], plus an additional 30 samples. Both phenotypes were best explained by a single SNP: rsl2722495 from group A again showed the strongest association with intensity of CD25 expression on memory T cells (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 5.50 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>, S5 Fig). For the proportion of naive CD4&#x002B; cells that express CD25, the Ml SNP rs41295055 from group D, whose association with CD25 expression was not previously tested, was preferred to the M2 SNP rs2104286 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 3.45 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup> <italic>versus p &#x003D;</italic> 2.56 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>, &#x0394;BIC&#x003D;8.43, which is interpreted as &#x201C;strong&#x201D; evidence in favour of rs41295055 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that rs2104286 is not itself functional, but merely tags other functional variants, which are themselves causal for MS.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The 10p15 region contains at least five apparently distinct associations to the immune-mediated diseases, T1D and MS. Our results are the first to support a four SNP model in T1D, which most likely reflects a combination of increased sample sizes and the increased variant density available due to ImmunoChip and imputation, as this model was supported by both conditional and fine mapping approaches. A previous comparative study of MS and T1D susceptibility in this region using conditional analysis of tag SNPs identified three groups of SNPs: their group I matches our group A, their group II our group C, and their group III our group B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The results showed that the minor allele of SNPs in all these groups was protective for T1D, but that group I (A) was not associated with MS and that group II (C) was susceptible for MS. Our results, based on larger sample sizes and more extensive variant coverage, suggest that the minor allele of SNPs in group A, shared between T1D and MS, are associated with the same protective effect for both diseases. This emphasises the need for surveying the most complete set of variants possible in order to make cross disease comparisons.</p>
<p>Variants in this region have previously been linked to several aspects of IL-2R signalling in T1D and MS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and the MS-associated variants we identify (whether under the M1 or M2 models) all showed some evidence of association with expression of CD25 on the surface of T cells, linking <italic>IL2RA</italic> in a primary way into the etiology of this disease. For T1D, we were only able to link the <italic>IL2RA</italic> intron 1 signal, shared with MS under the M1 model, to CD25 expression on memory T cells. Neither the intergenic T1D SNP group (C), despite physical overlap with the MS associated SNP group D, indexed by rs41295055, nor the sets near <italic>RBM17</italic> and <italic>PFKFB3</italic> (E and F) have yet been linked to <italic>IL2RA</italic> expression. These signals could relate to CD25 expression on other cell subsets or under specific conditions. The cell-specific regulation of <italic>IL2RA</italic> expression and its role in modulating the immune system are both complex and only partially understood. For example, in addition to T cells, IL2RA is also expressed on many other cell types, especially under inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. We have data on only a subset of IL-2R phenotypes that have been previously reported, and previous studies have genotyped only a subset of the disease associated SNPs described in this paper. Further genotyping of large samples with IL-2R related phenotypes is warranted to properly assess any other potential effects of the disease signals we identify on IL-2R signalling. Alternatively, it may be that other genes in the region, which have not been as well studied as <italic>IL2RA</italic>, are also causal for T1D, either directly or through interaction with <italic>IL2RA</italic>. For example, <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, an inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase isoform, allows rapid responses to energy requirements and insufficiency can lead to apoptosis and an inability to undergo autophagy in CD4&#x002B; T cells in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. <italic>PFKFB3</italic> has also been implicated in regulating insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], which could explain the T1D specific signals across this gene. All three genes, <italic>IL2RA</italic>, <italic>PFKFB3</italic> and <italic>RBM17</italic> are upregulated in CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells upon <italic>ex</italic> vivo activation (Table S3 Table) and two candidate SNPs, from groups E and F, sit between two DNase I sites close to the <italic>RBM17</italic> promoter. Furthermore, gene regulation can extend over 100 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and further studies will be needed to confirm the gene(s) through which these other SNPs influence T1D risk.</p>
<p>Two or more independent signals are commonly observed in fine mapped autoimmune disease regions using stepwise regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Despite long established doubts regarding the validity of stepwise regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], its use has continued to dominate in GWAS because of the number of SNPs measured simultaneously. Stepwise regression addresses the questions: &#x2018;which is the single variant that can best explain the maximum trait variance?&#x2019; and, conditional on this single variant, &#x2018;do any other variants explain additional trait variance?&#x2019; This is not equivalent to asking what set of variants best jointly explain trait variance. Often, as we have observed for T1D, stepwise regression may be expected to identify the same signals as the stochastic GUESSFM approach. However, our analyses demonstrate that different results may be produced by stepwise and full multi-variant search approaches in some cases. In particular, we highlight and prefer a two SNP model for MS association to the <italic>IL2RA</italic> region, one of the SNPs shared with T1D (group A, indexed by rsl2722495) and associated with CD25 expression on memory T cells, the other (group D, indexed by rs41295055) a better predictor for CD25 expression on the surface of naive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells than the SNP identified by stepwise regression (group C, rs2104286).</p>
<p>Methods that search the multimodal model space formed by multiple SNPs without conditioning on univarate association signals can reveal a more accurate picture of the likely disease causal variants in any region. Other Bayesian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], stochastic search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and penalised regression approaches such as lasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] have been proposed on a GWAS scale, but these aim primarily to detect association in data sets with relatively sparse genotype coverage. Applying the regularised regression approaches to our simulated data showed that the ROC curve for lasso with decreasing penalty out-performed stepwise analysis, but optimising the regularization parameter by minimising the cross validation error led to very high false discovery rates, suggesting that in this context this criterion is highly anti-conservative. Previous studies have also indicated that while regularised regression has strengths in terms of prediction, it may have weaknesses in terms of model selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], particularly for correlated predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Elastic net [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and the group lasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] have been proposed as regularised approaches tailored to correlated predictors, but in our hands did not outperform the simple lasso plus construction of a set of plausible SNPs according to <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.8. We considered that the information supplied to GUESSFM as a prior expected number of causal variants could be included equivalently in a regularised approach by setting the regularisation parameter according to the number of predictors expected. Although this produced a more competitive false discovery rate, discovery rates remained lower than with GUESSFM (S2 Table).</p>
<p>Our multidimensional analysis strategy, tailored to the high genotyping coverage (and, hence, high LD) required for fine mapping causal variants can provide a more complete picture of the likely causal variants in a region. Any fine mapping study is limited by the set of variants included for study. While we attempted to survey the fullest possible set of SNPs and small indels by using dense genotyping data, plus imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project data, we cannot be sure we included all variants that might affect gene function without sequencing of cases and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Further, larger indels, VNTRs and microsatellites remain particularly difficult to genotype with accuracy yet may contribute to disease. Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that all claims that a particular variant is causal are conditional on the true causal variants being accurately genotyped and included in the study.</p>
<p>It is well known that functional biological interactions may exist between variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], and therefore the possibility of statistical interactions needs to be considered in fine mapping studies. However, the need to fit interaction terms depends on the evolutionary history of the region. In the <italic>IL2RA</italic> region, there has been very little historical recombination (S1 Fig) and <italic>D</italic>&#x2032; between markers is nearly always 1, also indicating a lack of recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. As a consequence, only three of the possible four haplotypes that may be formed from any pair of SNPs are observed, and statistical interaction parameters are inestimable. This also implies that there is a one to one transformation between a haplotype model and a model expressing the log odds of disease as a linear function of single SNP effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], as we have employed. Thus, for the <italic>IL2RA</italic> region, we may neglect statistical interactions without making any assumptions about the existence of biological interactions. For our method to be applied to regions in which <italic>D</italic>&#x2032; &#x003C; 1, it would need extension to include statistical interaction terms. One simple approach, if the number of SNPs is not to large, would be to generate additional variables representing interactions between SNPs with <italic>D</italic>&#x2032; &#x003C; 1, but extending GUESS to fit interaction terms is another direction for further research.</p>
<p>An alternative approach would be to attempt to study disease risk across haplotypes directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], although these need to be inferred probabilistically when recombination has occurred. Haplotype-based analysis has become less common as marker density has improved. One reason for this is that haplotypes are particularly useful when marker density is low, because a haplotype may tag a causal variant better than any other single variants, and haplotype studies have thus fallen out of fashion as denser genotype data have become available. This is exemplified by a study that found multiple statistical interactions underlying gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] (statistical interactions may be thought of as haplotype models) using SNPs on a genomewide array. Subsequent analysis found that all interactions which replicated in an external dataset with whole genome sequencing, and thus with more complete coverage of potential causal variants, could be better explained by a single SNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. This suggests, perhaps, that statistical interactions between SNPs will prove rare. We note also that in regions of low recombination (high D&#x2019;), statistical interactions are not required to model biological interactions in <italic>cis</italic> because the information captured by a haplotype model is equivalent to that captured by a model which is additive over SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. However, if biological interactions between variants separated by LD do exist, and the interaction depends on the phase of the variants, i.e., the diplotype risk differs from the two locus genotype risk, haplotype methods will again be required to infer likely causal variants.</p>
<p>One way to understand the means through which the effects of a disease-associated variant are mediated is to perform functional assays to examine its effects on a gene&#x2019;s function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] or to identify potentially intermediate phenotypes with which it is also associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Improved identification of likely causal variants should enable us to identify these intermediate effects more accurately, thus leading to more powerful and reliable follow-up studies, as we saw considering the association of the proportion of naive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells that express CD25 with the MS-associated M1 SNP rs41295055 compared to the M2 SNP rs2104286, and/or reduced sample size, an important factor when many of these experiments require fresh primary cells and laborious wet lab protocols. Similarly, comparison with summary results from eQTL studies would be facilitated by the application of multi modal search strategies to the eQTL data set to ensure the effects of genetic variation are mapped as accurately as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. However, even with large samples, and careful fine-mapping analyses, the causal candidacy of SNPs in high LD cannot be resolved through statistical association alone. Functional studies designed to directly address the confounding induced by linkage disequilibrium, such as allele-specific expression using rare haplotypes that distinguish SNPs in the same tag group, may be helpful in refining further the likely causal variants.</p>
<p>Informative approaches to understanding disease etiology have recently been developed based on looking for enrichment of the cell-specific chromatin marks localising to likely causal variants, and these are being used to highlight disease relevant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Here, again, more accurate identification of causal variants will lead to more powerful and precise comparisons, and our approach, which is associated to a more accurate estimation of posterior probabilities for the SNPs in the considered region, should be readily adaptable to the growing set of methods that aim to examine enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] or colocalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] by model averaging over the posterior probabilities that a SNP is causal.</p>

<title>Simulation analysis</title>
<p>We used simulated data to compare the performance of our proposed method, traditional stepwise regression, the lasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] and the elastic net [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. For each simulation, we selected a random subset of 2,000 T1D control samples genotyped in the <italic>IL2RA</italic> region and a random set of between two and five &#x201C;causal variants&#x201D; from amongst the SNPs with MAF&#x003E; 0.01. We simulated a Gaussian phenotype for which the causal variants acted in an additive manner to jointly explain 10&#x0025; of the phenotypic variance. We conducted a total of 1,000 simulations for each scenario.</p>
<p>The data were analysed in parallel using the four different methods. We performed forward stepwise regression, and selected index SNPs at a given <italic>p</italic> value threshold, <italic>a,</italic> as those SNPs selected at any stage of the stepwise process with <italic>p &#x003C; &#x03B1;.</italic> For each index SNP, we created pseudo &#x201C;credible sets&#x201D; as the set of SNPs with <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.8 with the selected index SNPs. Note, by this definition, simulated causal SNPs may appear in more than one SNP group. We calculated the false discovery rate as the proportion of SNP groups which did not contain a causal variant, and we calculated the discovery rate as the proportion of causal variants found in at least one selected SNP group.</p>
<p>We used the snp.picker function from GUESSFM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/chrlswallace/GUESSFM">http://github.com/chrlswallace/GUESSFM</ext-link>) with default settings to define credible sets for causal SNPs. By definition of the algorithm, SNPs may only exist in exactly one SNP group. We selected SNP groups according to varying thresholds for the gMPPI, and calculated false discovery and discovery rates as above.</p>
<p>For lasso and elastic net, we used the R package glmnet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], and optimised the regularisation parameter &#x03BB; by minimising the ten fold cross validation error using the cv.<bold>glmnet</bold>() function. For elastic net, we kept the folds constant across different values of &#x03B1; &#x2208; [0.1,1] and chose the pair of values (<italic>&#x03B1;,</italic> &#x03BB;) which minimised the ten fold cross validation error overall. To examine the path of elastic net solutions, we fixed <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> at this value and varied &#x03BB;. We used the R package gglasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] to implement the grouped lasso, predefining groups of variables as those with <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.8 with each other using heirarchical clustering. We also considered the discovery and false discovery rates with the first three or first five predictors selected, as something analagous to the prior information given to GUESSFM about our expectation of the number of causal variants.</p>

<title>Association with cell surface expression of CD25</title>
<p>Naive CD4&#x002B; T cells from 209 donors were gated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Association with index SNPs from disease-associated groups was assessed through linear regression. All possible one, two and three SNP models were considered, and the model with the minimum BIC reported. Expression was log transformed to reduce right skew of the phenotype.</p>

<title>RNA seq gene expression data</title>
<p>We measured gene expression in the studied region in two pooled samples (n&#x003D;3 and n&#x003D;4 individuals / pool) comparing unstimulated and stimulated CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. For each individual, 250,000 CD4&#x002B; T cells (93-99&#x0025; pure, RosetteSep Human CD4&#x002B; T Cell Enrichment Cocktail, StemCell Technologies) were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 T-activator beads (Dynabeads Life Technologies) at a ratio of 0.3 beads / cell for four hours at 37&#x00B0;C in X-VIVO-15 (Lonza) &#x002B; 1&#x0025; AB serum (Lonza) and penicillin/ streptomycin (Life Technologies). Unstimulated CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells were cultured in medium alone for four hours. Cells were harvested directly into Qiagen lysis buffer (Qiagen) and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until RNA isolation.</p>
<p>RNA was isolated using RNeasy micro kit including gDNA depletion (Qiagen). RNA integrity and concentration was evaluated using the Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent), with all samples showing an RNA integrity score (RIN) &#x003E; 9.8. 750 ng of total RNA were used for the preparation of cDNA libraries using the Illumina TruSeq (Illumina) platform with a low-cycle-number PCR protocol, and was followed by transcriptome sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. This yielded four libraries with &#x223C;38 million 100 bp paired-end reads each.</p>
<p>We trimmed raw reads to remove primer and adapter contamination using HTSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], which affected 2&#x0025; of our sequences. Reads were aligned to the reference genome Ensembl GRCh37.pl3 using STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Removal of low quality and unpaired reads, indexing, <italic>IL2RA</italic> region extraction, and depth counting were performed using SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. We employed HTSeq and DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] to carry out a differential expression analysis between the two conditions based on normalised read counts. We only considered paired-end reads that featured a total and unambiguous overlap with genomic sequence assigned to genes, around 73&#x0025; of the initial raw sequences.</p>
