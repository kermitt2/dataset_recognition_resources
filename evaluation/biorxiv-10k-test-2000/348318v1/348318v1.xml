<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria severity is associated with parasite cytoadherence, but limited knowledge about its effect in malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is notorious. Our objective was to evaluate cytoadherence of infected red blood cells (iRBC) in a murine model of ARDS and appraise the role of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) in ARDS pathogenesis. Lungs from ARDS-developing mice showed evidences of iRBC accumulation in lungs besides increase of EPCR and TNF concentrations. Furthermore, TNF increased iRBC adherence <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dexamethasone-treated infected mice showed lower levels of TNF and EPCR mRNA expression and, finally, decreased the vascular permeability, protecting mice from ARDS. In addition, EPCR knockdown decreased the capacity of iRBC adherence <italic>in vitro</italic>. In conclusion, we identified that increased iRBC cytoadherence in lungs underlies malaria-associated ARDS in DBA/2 infected mice and that inflammation increased cytoadherence capacity through EPCR expression suggesting a potential target for drug development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>It&#x2019;s important to understand the development of malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to help in better prognosis and therapy. Carrying out a model using rodents suffering from ARDS, which is similar to that in humans, we were able to report, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, that <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA, a parasite from mice, adhere in lungs endothelial cells of infected mice. We show that a receptor named EPCR is important in this adhesion. This receptor is modulated by TNF, an pro-inflammatory factor, being decreased by dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug. This treatment, which improves the infected mice respiratory parameters and lung lesions, due to less adherence, inflammation and pulmonary vascular permeability, could be considered as a co-treatment with antimalarial drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria infections by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> are responsible for the largest number of severe and fatal cases in the tropics [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The main complications of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> include cerebral malaria, pulmonary complications, acute renal failure, severe anemia, bleeding and placental malaria [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An important aspect of the pathogenesis of severe malaria results from the ability of infected red blood cells (iRBC) to adhere in the microvasculature. This interaction between the iRBC and the endothelium can cause blocking blood flow and/or local inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, these adhesions promote the disappearance of asexual forms of the parasite in the peripheral circulation, thus, preventing them from being destroyed in the spleen [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Pulmonary complications caused by severe malaria include Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which has been associated with different diseases and not only being a result of severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Even though malaria-associated ARDS often causes high mortality rate, slight research has been done. Murine models have been used to study malaria-associated ARDS [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and DBA/2 mice infected with <italic>P. berghei ANKA</italic> (PbA) develop ARDS and die between the 7<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> days post infection (dpi) without signals of cerebral malaria. In addition, we established a predictive criteria to distinguish which mice would die from ARDS, on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi, using respiratory and parasitemia date [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Using this model, we found that recruitment of neutrophils and VEGF are essential to the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ARDS [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has a protective effect in the development of ARDS in mice [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, it has already been demonstrated that PbA-iRBC adhere to MVECS (microvascular lung endothelial cells from CBA/Ca mice) and that TNF-stimulated cells express more ICAM-1 and VCAM [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> model, the absence of ICAM-1 in infected mice, showed less anemia and weight loss, reduced parasite accumulation in both spleen and liver and higher peripheral blood parasitemia during acute stage malaria, which presented the slight importance of ICAM-1 in adhesion and pathogenesis of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Endothelial receptors have been studied to understand the iRBC adherence in the microvasculature of different organs in severe malaria and some of these receptors are well established such as ICAM-1 in cerebral malaria and CSA in placental malaria [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, both the adhesion and consequences of PbA-iRBC into DBA/2 lung endothelial cells remains unknown. In 2013, Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) was shown to be a new receptor for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte protein 1 (PfEMP1) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> severe malaria [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which may result in a new branch of research in severe malaria. EPCR has, as its primary function, to bind with activated protein C (APC) and to cleave protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), in a specifically RAC1 pathway, which inhibits the activation of the nuclear factor-&#x03BA;&#x03B2; and provides barrier protection [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EPCR facilitates the activation of protein C (PC) by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex; the cytoprotective effects of EPCR results in vascular and tissue protection in brain, lungs, kidneys and liver [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Also, APC cytoprotective activities provide neuroprotective effects as anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic, protecting the blood-brain barrier, kidneys and lungs, and thus, may be directly relevant to the complications associated with severe malaria [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, in vitro studies with purified CIDR&#x03B1;1 domains and iRBCs with selected <italic>P. falciparum</italic> laboratory strains confirm the loss of EPCR functionality upon CIDR&#x03B1;1 or iRBC binding that includes loss of PC and APC binding to EPCR, inhibition of EPCR-mediated PC activation and obstruction of APC-mediated endothelial barrier protective effects. Consequently, the binding of PfEMP1 to EPCR results in an acquired functional PC system deficiency which supports new evidences that EPCR plays a central role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. EPCR binding is mediated through the amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDRa1) of DC8 and group PfEMP1 subfamilies, and that CIDRa1 interferes with protein C binding to EPCR [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it has unexpectedly been shown that parasitized erythrocytes expressing the DC13 HB3var03 or IT4var07 variants of PfEMP1 do not bind to the EPCR of brain endothelial cells in vitro. On the other hand, it has been evidenced that the DC8 variant IT4var19 may bind to the EPCR, but this interaction was inhibited when standard human serum or plasma was added to the assays. Therefore, the discrepancy in the binding activity of the EPCR and the recombinant PfEMP1 proteins indicates the need for further studies to understand the current physiological significance resulting from this PfEMP1-EPCR interaction [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Although there are some suggestions that PfEMP1 can bind to EPCR with important effects on the severe malaria, these data are controversial, and, in addition, there are any evidences of <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA binding on EPCR and the effects of EPCR on ARDS pathogenesis must be elucidated. Our study herein was developed in a murine model, which mimics various human ARDS, [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and used primary culture of microvascular lung endothelial cells from DBA/2 mice (PMLEC), to clarify not only the adhesion of infected erythrocytes to murine lung microvascular endothelial cells, but also understand the relevant aspects of EPCR modulation by the immune response which can bring important contribution to understand malaria-associated ARDS.</p>

<p>In our previous study, it was shown that a proportion of DBA/2 mice infected with PbA-iRBC developed singular characteristics of ARDS and died between the 7<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> dpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To investigate if adherence is essential in the evolution of this phenotype, we observed that PbA-luciferase-infected erythrocytes were distributed in the peripheral blood and tissues of DBA/2 mice. However, when they were perfused with PBS 1x, the bioluminescence (luciferase/luciferin) signal remained concentrated in spleen and lungs, especially in ARDS-developing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 A-C</xref>), corroborating with our published data [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We demonstrated that ARDS-developing mice showed higher levels of <italic>18s</italic> subunit PbA rRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>) and higher hemozoin concentration in the lungs compared to HP-developing mice, on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1 E-G</xref>). In addition, we analyzed histological lung section of ARDS-developing mice, finding several iRBC in close contact with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1H</xref>). These results together indicated that ARDS-developing mice accumulated a considerable amount of infected red blood cells (iRBC) in the lungs, suggesting the essential participation on ARDS pathogenesis.</p>

<title>TNF increases <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> adherence in ARDS experimental model</title>
<p>ARDS-developing mice, on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi, displayed higher TNF levels in serum compared to HP-developing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that this inflammatory cytokine may be critical to ARDS development. For this, we further investigated if iRBC could contribute to TNF release by endothelial cells. First, we demonstrated that PMLEC stimulated with iRBC can directly contribute to TNF production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). Then, we checked the influence of TNF in adhesion of iRBC in PMLEC through static and flow conditions. It was observed that TNF-stimulated cells increased the capacity of iRBC adherence into PMLEC after 24 and 72 hours in static assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 C-E</xref>). In the flow adherence assay, which mimics the physiologic conditions, the iRBC had more cytoadherence with TNF than without TNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 F-H</xref>). In addition, PMLEC were seeded in transwell plates in indirect contact with peritoneal macrophages (M&#x03C6;), stimulated or not by red blood cells (RBC) or iRBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2I</xref>). M&#x03C6; stimulated by iRBC produced more TNF than M&#x03C6; without previous contact with iRBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2J</xref>). These M&#x03C6; also produced IFN-&#x03B3; and IL-10 but with no difference between groups (data not shown). Additionally, PMLEC that was submitted to indirect contact with M&#x03C6; stimulated with iRBC demonstrating more adherence of iRBC than PMLEC with no previous contact with M&#x03C6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2K</xref>). Finally, in order to evaluate the contribution of TNF in the adhesion of iRBC in PMLEC, cells were blocked with TNF antibody and, as a result, the blockage reduced the capacity of iRBC to adhere in PMLEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2L</xref>). All these data show that ARDS-developing mice have more TNF, which contributes to iRBC adherence in endothelial cells than in HP-developing mice.</p>

<title>EPCR acts directly in <italic>P. berghei</italic> cytoadherence</title>
<p>Looking for adhesion molecules that could be involved in PbA-iRBC cytoadherence in ARDS pathogenesis, we observed that ARDS-developing mice showed higher levels of VCAM and ICAM-1 in lungs than HP-developing or non-infected mice (NI), analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Fig S2 A-C). Also, recombinant TNF upregulated the mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM in PMLEC (Fig S2 D-I).</p>
<p>However, the most interesting findings were the mRNA EPCR expression upregulated in the lungs of ARDS-developing mice compared to NI mice (28.48-fold increase) and HP-developing mice (13.16-fold increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). There was also an increase in soluble EPCR (sEPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>) and EPCR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>) in ARDS-developing mice serum compared to HP-developing mice. We further investigated the influence of TNF in the regulation of EPCR expression in PMLEC. TNF-stimulated cells showed an upregulation in EPCR expression in 48 and 72 hours, but not with PbA-iRBC stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3 D-F</xref>). Moreover, EPCR knockdown with siRNA transfection in PMLEC, reduced EPCR expression compared to non-stimulated PMLEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3G</xref>) and reduced the adherence of iRBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3H</xref>), suggesting an important contribution of TNF and EPCR to adherence of iRBC in PMLEC.</p>

<title>Dexamethasone reduces TNF and EPCR, protecting mice lungs and PMLEC from increased vascular permeability</title>
<p>Once TNF seems to be important to induce PbA-iRBC adherence, and consequently, ARDS development, DBA/2 mice were infected with PbA-iRBC and treated with dexamethasone (80 mg/kg) to investigate if it could protect them from lung injury. Dexamethasone treatment decreased TNF concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>) apart from IL-6 and IL-33 concentrations in treated mice, compared to non-treated mice (Fig S3 A and B). Dexamethasone also downregulated EPCR expression in lungs of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>) and sEPCR concentration in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">D</xref>). VEGF concentration, an essential factor to increase vascular permeability and ARDS development, also decreased after dexamethasone treatment in the BAL of infected mice, on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>Consequently, we analyzed the lung vascular permeability and dexamethasone-treated infected mice showed to be protected compared to non-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4F-H</xref>). To clarify the mechanism that reduced the lung permeability, the opening of interendothelial junctions in PMLEC through actin analyzes was evaluated. The PMLEC stimulated with iRBC increased the spaces between the interedothelial junctions and leads to the disruption and reorganization in the actin filaments which was protected by the treatment with dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">J</xref>). iRBC-stimulated PMLEC also demonstrated more permeability of Evans Blue in a transwell assay, compared to dexamethasone-treated PMLEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4K</xref>). Additionally, dexamethasone-treated PMLEC showed a reduction in VEGF concentration compared to cells not treated with dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4L</xref>). Everything considered, these data suggest that dexamethasone is capable to reduce inflammation, decreasing EPCR and vascular permeability in PMLEC and lungs of DBA/2 mice.</p>

<title>Anti-inflammatory drug protects mice from ARDS but not from malaria infection</title>
<p>Dexamethasone-treated mice improved their respiratory parameters [Respiratory Frequency, Tidal Volume and Enhanced Pause (Penh)] compared to infected nontreated mice, on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 A-C</xref>). On the other hand, parasitemia levels increased in peripheral blood in dexamethasone-treated mice on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>) and these mice succumbed between 8 and 20 dpi with characteristics of HP, without edema and lower inflammatory infiltration according to the histopathological and count of iRBC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5 D-G</xref>). Finally, we proposed the essential mechanisms of protection of dexamethasone in experimental malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>) suggesting that PbA-iRBC induce TNF release by endothelial cells and by M&#x03C6;, then the TNF up-regulates EPCR expression in PMLEC, increasing the iRBC adhesion through EPCR pathway. The adhesion of iRBC in PMLEC leads to gap formations increase in the interendothelial junction, raising vascular permeability and consequently, edema formation. Activated alveolar macrophages also produce TNF, which contributes to the activation of endothelial cells, possible recruitment of neutrophils [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and alveolar damage. The drastic reduction in inflammation with dexamethasone may be responsible for the increase in parasitemia and mortality. All things considered, these data suggest that TNF is essential to increase expression of EPCR and consequently, increase adhesion of iRBC in malaria-associated ARDS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe, in the present study, the cytoadherence of PbA-iRBC in microvascular lungs endothelial cells in mice which develop ARDS as well as the importance of the EPCR in this mechanism and, consequently, in the ARDS pathogenesis.</p>
<p>A relevant advantage of this study is that our animal model reproduces physiopathological aspects from those found in human ARDS [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, the pathogenesis of ARDS in this experimental model is only related to pulmonary manifestation development, because there are no inflammatory signs associated to cerebral malaria [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], differently from what occurs in some other animal models [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also important to note that most ARDS-associated malaria models have their syndrome aspects compared with those in non-infected mice. Here, we compared aspects of ARDS mice with those also infected but had not developed the syndrome and died from hyperparasitemia and anemia.</p>
<p>It is well known that mature forms of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-iRBC can adhere to the microvasculature of different organs which is an important feature in the pathogenesis of severe malaria in humans [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Animal models have been used to study severe malaria pathogenesis which is well established, especially for cerebral malaria [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, as there are just few studies focusing ARDS murine models [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the pathogenesis is not completely enlightened. Recently, PbA-iRBC has been demonstrated, <italic>in vitro</italic>, to adhere to MVECS (microvascular lung endothelial cells from CBA/Ca mice) and that TNF-stimulated cells have expressed more ICAM-1 and VCAM [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and in our results. Nonetheless, there are not studies about the expression of EPCR in acute respiratory distress syndrome in human beings or murine malaria. It is known that iRBC adhere to endothelial cells, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, the study herein is the first showing PbA-iRBC adherence using DBA/2 mice that developed ARDS. Additionally, our findings provide the first evidence that PbA-iRBC adhere more in ARDS-developing mice than in those HP-developing. Moreover, we found that ARDS-developing mice have about 28.5 times more EPCR expression than those not infected, implying that EPCR can be essential in ARDS progress. Finally, we demonstrated that TNF-stimulated cells induced EPCR expression while iRBC did not.</p>
<p>Previously, we had found that ARDS-developing mice showed more parasites load in lungs, which can be important to induce the syndrome, than those HP-developing. On the other hand, it is mostly unknown whether the parasite can directly induce ARDS development or not.</p>
<p>Quite a few works have been presenting the adherence of PbA Luciferase (PbAluc) <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and our work reinforces it. The PbAluc-iRBC was accumulated in the lungs of DBA/2 mice, especially in those ARDS-developing, when the organs were perfused we confirmed that the PbA-iRBC was adhered mainly in the lungs and spleen. On the other hand, in our experimental model, there was no adhesion in the brain as in other models of ARDS [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Also, ARDS-developing mice showed more hemozoin (Hz) area in lungs compared to those HP-developing on the 7<sup>th</sup> dpi, the onset of ARDS development, and some previous works suggest that Hz, which is released from the food vacuole into circulation during erythrocyte lysis is rapidly taken up by circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages, inducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition Hz linked by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> DNA is a ligand for TLR 9, which activates innate immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulting in the production of cytokines, chemokines, and up-regulation of costimulatory molecules [<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and proinflammatory mediators like IL-1&#x03B2;, via NLP3 inflammasome complex activation [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, due to the fact that some mice develop ARDS and others do not, and HP-developing mice also had some Hz and parasite adhered in lungs, we further investigated the adhesion of PbA-iRBC in endothelial cells with different stimuli. Other studies show that endothelial cells stimulated with TNF had an increase in ICAM-1 expression [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], corroborating with our results <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, as recently demonstrated that TNF and ICAM-1 markers were increased in the lungs of the patients who developed the syndrome [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is interesting to highlight that the parasites by themselves (PbA-iRBC or PbA-iRBC extract) cannot upregulate the ICAM-1, VCAM or EPCR expression in DBA/2-PMLEC. Actually, PbA-iRBC adhere more in TNF-stimulated DBA/2-PMLEC.</p>
<p>With the hypothesis that inflammation is essential to expose adherence molecules and consequently ARDS pathogenesis, we treated DBA/2 mice with dexamethasone to reduce inflammation, observing that these mice were protected from ARDS and had a downregulation in EPCR expression, which indicates that EPCR may be important to iRBC adherence and to the pathology progress of the disease. However, in a recent study, the expression of EPCR decreased in the lungs of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected patients who developed ARDS when compared to those who did not develop, analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Although, the authors suggest that the change in EPCR, together with thrombomodulin in association with the deposition of hemozoin in the lungs, play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Besides that, dexamethasone-treated mice are less susceptible to increase the vascular permeability. Likewise, iRBC-stimulated PMLEC and treated with dexamethasone showed lesser permeability compared to not treated cells. These results are similar to those found in an experimental model of C57bl/6 mice infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> NK65 and treated with the same dose of dexamethasone. The authors showed an increase in the peripheral parasitemia and ARDS protection [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but not an effect in the pulmonary vascular permeability. On the other hand, the increase in vascular permeability was previously found in our ARDS model [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected patients present elevated levels of circulating nitrogen oxide reactive intermediates and by cytokines, such as IFN&#x03B1;/&#x03B3;, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and the chemokine IL-8. Furthermore, these cytokines and chemokines levels have been found to correlate with different manifestations of severe malaria [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, although ARDS of different etiologies is characterized by a local inflammatory response, the inflammatory mediators can spread into the general circulation. The severity of ARDS depends on of the magnitude of the resultant systemic inflammatory response [<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Based on our results, the treatment with dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory drug, decreased the serum concentrations of IL-33, IL-6 and TNF in PbA-infected mice. IL-33 is a tissue-derived nuclear cytokine from the IL-1 family and it&#x2019;s highly expressed during homeostasis and inflammation in endothelial, epithelial and fibroblast-like cells, working as an alarm signal released upon cell injury or tissue damage to alert immune cells to express the ST2 receptor (IL-1RL1). The major targets of IL-33 <italic>in vivo</italic> are tissue-resident immune cells such as mast cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). IL-33 is emerging as a crucial immune modulator in regulatory immune responses and infectious inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Bronchial IL-33 expression is significantly increased in severe malaria patients with pulmonary edema [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, in PbA-induced experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), IL-33 expression is increased in brain, and ST2-deficient mice were resistant to PbA-induced neuropathology [<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. On the other hand, another publication demonstrated that PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with recombinant IL-33 presented no signs of neurological pathology associated with CM and had reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines[<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
<p>The IL-6-type cytokines are released in response to tissue injury and/or an inflammatory stimulus. They act locally and systemically to generate a variety of physiologic responses, especially in the acute phase response [<xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Circulating IL-6 levels are elevated in nearly all infectious, traumatic, and inflammatory states including ARDS. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in BAL and plasma of patients with ARDS and those at risk [<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Finally, the TNF is an inflammatory mediator strongly implicated in the development of ARDS [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], signal through two receptors, p55 and p75, which play differential roles in pulmonary edema formation during ARDS. It was shown that p55 by a novel domain antibody (dAb&#x2122;) attenuated ventilator-induced lung injury [<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and also lung injury and edema formation in models of ARDS induced by acid aspiration [<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Recently, a selective blockage of TNFR1 (GSK1995057 antibody) inhibited cytokine and neutrophil adhesion molecule expression in activated HMVEC-L monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic> and attenuated inflammation and signs of lung injury in primates. Moreover, treatment with this antibody attenuated pulmonary neutrophilia, inflammatory cytokine release and signs of endothelial injury in BAL and serum sample in healthy humans challenged with a low dose of inhaled endotoxin [<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data suggest that <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection induces TNF production by inflammatory and endothelial cells, leading to the expression of adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, VCAM and, especially EPCR. These results allow us to infer that those factors are essential for PbA-iRBC cytoadhesion, and, thus, strongly suggest the participation of these mechanisms in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ARDS. Being known that inhibition of cytoadhesion mechanisms may improve the prognosis of infection [<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we emphasize that the processes described above may be important targets in the treatment of ARDS due to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, acting as adjunctive therapy in association with the use of antimalarials, not only making the treatment more efficient, but also reducing the morbidity and mortality of these patients.</p>

<p>PMLEC between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> passage was seeded (8&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup>/well) in 2-wells permanox chamber slides labteck (Thermo Scientific, Nunc). The cells were incubated at 37 &#x00B0; C and 5&#x0025; CO<sup>2</sup> for 24 hours. After this time, TNF might have been added for 24 hours or not (control). In sequence, the stimulus was removed and mature forms of EP-PbA (25 per cell) in DMEM supplemented with 20&#x0025; FBS were added and allowed to interact with the endothelial cells for 1 hour at 37&#x00B0;C in 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the wells were detached from the polystyrene slides and the slides were added to the flow system composed of a chamber (Cell Adhesion Flow chamber, Immunetics) which kept the slide adhered through the formation of a vacuum (coupled by a vacuum pump), a syringe pump (insight Inc.), an inverted microscope (Zeiss Vert. A1) connected to a camera (Axio Cam ERc 5s Zeiss) and to a computer with an image capture system (program Zen 2011, AxioVision Rel 4.8.2 SP2).</p>
<p>The chamber was initially filled with DMEM medium, then an initial photo with the parasites adhered to the CEPP-DBA/2 was taken, after, a medium continuous stream was run through the chamber and maintained at 2 ml/hour with a pump syringe (Insight Inc). Five images, every 3 minutes, of each well were captured, maintaining the same field as the initial image, to determine the erythrocyte binding efficiency.</p>
<p>Image processing and analysis were performed by ImageJ (Version 1.46r). The images were opened individually in ImageJ and analyzed through the &#x201C;cell counter&#x201D; plugin, where all EP-PbA images were selected on each image. After counting all the images, the total of EP-PbA that remained in the final image (15 minutes) was recorded.

<p>The statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> 5.0 software for analysis and graphing. The data were analysed for normality by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Shapiro-Wilk normality test and the variance with Bartlett test. Non-parametric variables for two groups were compared by using Mann-Whitney test. For analysis of three groups, we used Kruskal-Wallis test followed Dunn post-test. In order to compare parametrical variables for two groups, T-test was employed and for three or more groups, One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test were used. For the survival curves, Log-rank and Gehan-Breslow Wilcoxon tests were applied. The differences between the groups were considered significant when p&#x2264;0.05 (5&#x0025;). To establish a cutoff from data, ROC curves were generated by using the results of the control group obtained in MedCalc version 8.2.1.0.</p>
