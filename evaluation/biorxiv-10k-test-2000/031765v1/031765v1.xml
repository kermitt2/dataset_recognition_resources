<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>How does cortical state affect neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, and is it analogous between anesthetized and awake animals? We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) in isoflurane-anesthetized cat V1 while repeatedly presenting wide-field natural scene movie clips. Spiking responses were remarkably precise, reliable and sparse. Many units had distinct barcodelike firing patterns, with features as little as 10 ms wide. LFP-derived cortical state switched spontaneously between synchronized (1/f) and desynchronized (broadband). Surprisingly, responses were more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized than desynchronized state. However, the desynchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to attending periods in awake animals, during which responses are enhanced. Our results therefore complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals. The presence of orientation maps in cat V1 may explain contrary reports in anesthetized rodents, and predicts a similar result in anesthetized ferret and primate V1.</p></abstract>

<p>As a complex dynamic system, the brain is never in exactly the same state twice. Spontaneous changes in brain state were noted in even the earliest electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. However, most experiments that examine sensory neural responses to repeated presentations of identical stimuli implicitly assume that the brain is in the same state at the onset of each trial, and that averaging over trials will provide a reasonable estimate of response variability. There is increasing evidence that this may not always be the case, even under anesthesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Brain state can play a major role in response variability, and taking brain state into account can reduce apparent response variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are two broad categorizations of brain state: synchronized and desynchronized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>&#x2019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The synchronized state is characterized by large amplitude low frequency fluctuations, and occurs during deep anesthesia, slow-wave sleep, and awake quiescent periods (quiet wakefulness). The synchronized state can be further subdivided into <sc>up</sc> and <sc>down</sc> phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, corresponding to periods of higher and lower resting membrane potential. The desynchronized state is characterized by low amplitude high frequency fluctuations, and occurs during light anesthesia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and awake attending behavior.</p>
<p>Visual neuroscience has traditionally relied on reduced stimuli such as drifting bars and gratings to characterize response properties. Naturalistic stimuli can elicit responses that are poorly predicted from responses to reduced stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Although reduced stimuli are easier to characterize and are of much lower dimensionality than naturalistic stimuli, relying too heavily on reduced stimuli may obscure insights into how the brain processes visual information. To more fully characterize neural populations in visual cortex, it is therefore important to consider responses to naturalistic stimuli in addition to reduced stimuli. Although sequences of natural images are spatially naturalistic, the gold standard is natural scene movies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, which are both spatially and temporally naturalistic.</p>
<p>How variable are natural scene movie responses in V1, and how does cortical state influence them? We examined response variability in single units across most layers of primary visual cortex (V1) in isoflurane-anesthetized cats using single-shank silicon polytrodes, while stimulating with natural scene movies containing saccade-like camera movements. Cortical state varied spontaneously over time, and was characterized by the frequency content of deep-layer local field potential (LFP). Recordings were divided into synchronized and desynchronized periods. Spiking responses to natural scene movies were at times remarkably precise, reliable and sparse, consisting of barcode-like patterns of response events consistent across trials, some as little as 10 ms wide. Correlations between trial-averaged responses of unit pairs were weak overall (&#x007E; 0.1) at the 20 ms time scale, but were stronger in the synchronized than desynchronized state. Contrary to reports in primary sensory cortices of anesthetized rodent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, natural scene movie responses in anesthetized cat V1 were more precise, reliable and sparse in the synchronized than desynchronized state. In the synchronized state, trial-averaged responses were also better correlated with motion within the movie. These results are surprising, because the synchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to quiescent periods in awake animals and the desynchronized state to alert attending periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and neural responses are known to be enhanced to attended stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our results therefore complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals. One possible reason for this conflicting result may be the presence of orientation maps in cat V1 and their absence in rodent V1. Standing and traveling waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> of activation (<sc>up</sc> phases) in the synchronized state may interact differently with incoming stimuli in V1 of higher mammals. This explanation predicts a similar result in anesthetized V1 of other species with orientation maps, such as ferrets and primates, but fails to explain the opposite result in awake animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cortical state</title>
<p>Cortical state was characterized by the frequency content of the deep-layer LFP <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>)</bold>. The synchronized state was defined by large amplitude low frequency fluctuations with an approximately 1/f distribution, while the desynchronized state consisted of lower amplitude fluctuations spanning a wider range of frequencies <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>)</bold>. Spontaneous transitions between the two states were visible in the LFP spectrogram <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>)</bold>. A synchrony index (SI) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>)</bold> was used to quantify the degree of synchronization over time. SI was defined as the L/(L&#x002B;H) ratio, where L and H are the power in low (0.5&#x2013;7 Hz) and high (15-100 Hz) LFP frequency bands, respectively <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>, Methods)</bold>. SI ranged from 0 to 1, where 1 represents maximum synchronization. The distribution of SI from all recordings is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold> (inset). Based on both visual inspection of the LFP spectrogram and application of thresholds to the corresponding SI (synchronized: SI &#x003E; 0.85; desynchronized: SI &#x003C; 0.8; exact thresholds varied slightly between recordings), recordings were divided into periods of synchronized, desynchronized and undefined states. Six natural scene movie recordings (3.5 h total duration, 5 penetrations in 3 cats) exhibited an obvious spontaneous change in cortical state (5 from desynchronized to synchronized, 1 from synchronized to desynchronized, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref> &#x0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a&#x2014;e</xref></bold>). A similar amount of time was spent in both states (104 min synchronized, 93 min desynchronized, 10 min undefined). A total of 219 single units were isolated in these 6 recordings.</p>

<title>Natural scene movie responses</title>
<p>Spike raster plots of 3 example single units are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>, in response to 400 presentations of two different wide-field natural scene movie clips, each 4.5 s in duration. One spontaneous cortical state transition occurred during each movie. Spike raster plots across trials exhibited a pattern reminiscent of UPC barcodes, consisting of remarkably precise, reliable and sparse response events. For both natural scene movies, this pattern was visibly more pronounced during the synchronized than desynchronized state. Each unit&#x2019;s peristimulus time histogram (PSTH, i.e., the response averaged over trials) was classified as responsive during a given cortical state if it contained at least one response event. Response events were detected using an automated method to cluster spike times (<bold>Methods</bold>). Example PSTHs are shown underneath the raster plots in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref></bold>, with colored dots marking detected response events. A total of 267 out of a possible 563 PSTHs were classified as responsive. There were more responsive PSTHs in the synchronized than desynchronized state (153 vs. 114, <italic>&#x03C7;</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.02), and significantly more response events in the synchronized than desynchronized state (1167 vs. 703, <italic>&#x03C7;</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 7.4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;27</sup>).</p>

Each black tick represents one spike. Each presentation was separated by 1 s of blank gray screen (from 4.5 to 5.5 s of trial time). PSTHs are shown underneath each raster plot, color-coded by state, with dots marking detected response events. For display purposes, each PSTH panel uses a different vertical scale. For all 3 example units during both movies, responses were visibly more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized state than the desynchronized state. A 20 minute gap of blank gray screen stimulation separated the end of the first recording (<bold>a</bold>) from the start of the second (<bold>e</bold>).

<p>The 3 example units in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold> were responsive to both natural scene movie clips, but some units in that pair of recordings were responsive to only one movie and not the other. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref></bold> shows 3 such example units. For the two natural scene movie recordings shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref></bold>, 51&#x0025; (20/39) of responsive units were responsive during only one movie: 8 responded only to the first movie, and 12 responded only to the second. However, 50&#x0025; (39/78) of units isolated in that penetration did not respond to either movie. Some units were responsive in one cortical state but nonresponsive in the other (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>). Across all 6 recordings, 30&#x0025; (49/163) of responsive units were responsive only during the synchronized state, 6&#x0025; (10/163) were responsive only during the desynchronized state, and 64&#x0025; (104/163) were responsive during both states.</p>

All four measures were significantly greater in the synchronized than desynchronized state (means, <italic>p</italic> values, and statistical tests reported in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). Five unique movie clips were presented in these 6 recordings. Response event amplitude was quantified as the height (in Hz) above baseline of each peak in the PSTH (<bold>Methods</bold>). Response event width (in ms) was quantified as twice the standard deviation of the spike times belonging to the event. Response reliability was quantified as the mean pairwise correlation of all trial pairs of a unit&#x2019;s responses. The sparseness (<bold><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref></bold>) of each PSTH ranged from 0 to 1, with 0 corresponding to a uniform signal, and 1 corresponding to a signal with all of its energy in a single time bin.</p>

The distributions of spike counts per response event per trial are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref></bold>, separately for each state. In both states, the distribution was very close to lognormal (dashed curves), with geometric means of 0.5 spikes/event/trial, well below 1 spike/event/trial. In the synchronized and desynchronized states, 78&#x0025; and 76&#x0025;, respectively, of response events had &#x2264; 1 spike/trial. Therefore, &#x003E; 75&#x0025; of response events in either state were unlikely to be the result of bursting.</p>

<p>How might mean firing rates vary as a function of cortical state? Although intuition suggests that rates should be higher in the desynchronized state, previous reports show no clear relationship between mean firing rates and cortical state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The mean firing rate of each unit during a cortical state was calculated by taking its spike count during that state and dividing by the duration of the state. The distributions of mean firing rates across the population are shown separately for both states in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref></bold>. Mean firing rates spanned a wide range (0.0005-50 Hz), with a distribution that was approximately lognormal (dashed curves). This was the case in both states. Surprisingly, mean rates in the synchronized and desynchronized state were not significantly different (Mann-Whitney U test, ensemble geometric means of 0.18 and 0.14 Hz and standard deviations of 1.0 and 1.1 orders of magnitude, respectively).</p></sec>

<title>Response correlations and MUA coupling</title>
<p>By definition, pairwise correlations of single unit responses should be greater in the synchronized than desynchronized state. Pearson&#x2019;s correlation between PSTHs was calculated for all simultaneously recorded pairs of responsive single units. This was done separately for both cortical states. Response correlations were weakly positive on average, and were indeed significantly greater in the synchronized than desynchronized state (0.18 and 0.11, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8c</xref></bold>). Response correlations in both states had a weak but significantly negative dependence on unit pair separation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>A recent report has shown that the degree of coupling between single unit and multi-unit activity (MUA) is a simple but consistent metric for characterizing single units, and that it can be used to predict single unit pairwise response correlations and the probability of synaptic connectivity with other neighboring neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. How might MUA coupling relate to cortical states and natural scene movie responses in cat V1? MUA coupling was calculated for each single unit by calculating the trial-averaged MUA (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10d</xref></bold>) from all single units, excluding the single unit of interest, and correlating that with the unit&#x2019;s PSTH (<bold>Methods</bold>). This was done for all single units during both cortical states. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9a</xref></bold> shows the distributions of MUA coupling across the population. MUA coupling was significantly greater in the synchronized than desynchronized state (Mann-Whitney U test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 6 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>). Single unit response reliability was significantly and positively correlated with MUA coupling, in both cortical states (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9b</xref></bold>).

<title>LFP and MUA reliability and sparseness</title>
<p>Given that single unit responses during natural scene movie stimulation were more reliable and sparse in the synchronized state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref></bold>), does the same hold for the LFP and MUA? Trial-aligned LFP and MUA are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10a,d</xref></bold> in both cortical states for one example recording. As expected, the amplitudes of the LFP and MUA were greater in the synchronized state (shown more explicitly for LFP in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>). LFP and MUA reliability were measured in a similar way as for single unit responses, using Pearson&#x2019;s correlation between the signal on each trial and the mean of the signal on all other trials. This was done for all trials in both states in all 6 recordings (988 desynchronized trials, 1093 synchronized trials). LFP and MUA reliability were both significantly greater in the synchronized than desynchronized state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10b,e</xref></bold>). The sparseness of each of these LFP and MUA traces were also measured (for LFP, sparseness of the absolute value of the signal was used).

<title>Stimulus representation</title>
<p>How do precise and reliable single unit responses, such as those shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>-<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref></bold>, relate to the visual stimulus, and how does stimulus representation vary with cortical state? Calculating receptive fields from short repetitive natural scene movie clips is a difficult and perhaps intractable problem, given the spatial and temporal correlations inherent to movies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and the low number of movie frames per clip (300 for each of the 5 unique clips used here). Instead, responses were compared to the global motion, contrast and luminance calculated as a function of time from all of the on-screen pixels of each movie clip (<bold>Methods</bold>). The correlation between each responsive unit&#x2019;s PSTH and movie global motion, contrast and luminance signals was calculated separately in each cortical state. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11a</xref></bold> shows movie frames and the global motion signal of an example movie clip (same as <bold>Supplemental Movie</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a,c</xref></bold>), as well as the PSTH of an example single unit in both cortical states. Movie clips consisted of simulated saccades generated by manually rotating the camera with short, quick motions. This resulted in a highly kurtotic distribution of global motion within the movies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11b</xref></bold>). The correlation between responsive PSTHs and global motion was weak, but was significantly greater in the synchronized than desynchronized state <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11c,d</xref></bold>, mean values of 0.091 and 0.041 respectively). This was when calculated at a delay of 30 ms (2 movie frames) between stimulus and response. The mean PSTH-motion correlation as a function of stimulus-response delay is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11e</xref></bold>. Not only was it greatest in the synchronized state at a delay of 30 ms, but stimulus-response delay modulated PSTH-motion correlation more in the synchronized than desynchronized state. In comparison, single unit responses were much more weakly correlated with global movie contrast and luminance (taken as the standard deviation and mean, respectively, of the pixel values of each frame), and did not differ significantly as a function of cortical state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>2). However, both contrast and luminance were again more strongly modulated as a function of stimulus-response delay in the synchronized than desynchronized state <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. 12c,f</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Single unit responses to natural scene movie clips consisted of barcode-like response events (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref></bold>), some as little as 10 ms in duration (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref></bold>). Across the population of units, there was great diversity in the patterns of response events, as shown by the low mean pairwise response correlations between units (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8c</xref></bold>). There was also a surprisingly wide range of mean firing rates, most below 1 Hz, which approximately followed a lognormal distribution (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref></bold>), in line with an increasing number of reports in various species and cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the distribution of spike counts per response event per trial was also lognormal (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref></bold>), and low enough to preclude bursting as a major component of response events.</p>
<p>There are a handful of existing reports of such temporally precise, reliable and sparse responses to natural scene movies in V1: in awake behaving macaque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and in anesthetized cat, both ex-tracellularly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and intracellularly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Similar precision and reliability have been reported in awake behaving macaque area MT during random dot stimulation with low motion coherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. There have been more reports of even greater temporal precision (events as little as &#x007E; 1 ms wide), reliability and sparseness of responses to high-entropy stimuli in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of salamander and rabbit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of anesthetized cat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As visual information propagates from RGCs to LGN to V1, the temporal precision and reliability of responses generally decrease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. It is interesting to consider that this precision is retained at all. LGN inputs constitute only a small fraction of synapses onto (mostly layer 4) cortical cells, yet these inputs are very effective at driving the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition to the high effectiveness of LGN-V1 synapses, convergent event-like input from LGN in response to naturalistic stimuli may be another reason for this strong drive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Clearly, there must be some evolutionary benefit in maintaining, to some degree, these temporally precise response events in V1. Sparse coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and the energy efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> that comes with it may be one such reason. Another may relate to delay line coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which proposes that precise relatively-timed spikes might allow for simple scale-invariant representations of stimuli. This theory is supported by increasing evidence that cortical cells can respond with high temporal precision and reliability relative to a stimulus, and therefore relative to each other as well.</p>
<p>The spectral content of deep-layer LFP showed that cortical state spontaneously switched between two extremes: the synchronized and desynchronized state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a&#x2013;e</xref></bold>). There are many non-perceptual tasks that even primary sensory cortices might be engaged in during stimulus presentation. Such tasks might include attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, memory formation and recall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, reward encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, visualization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, synaptic renormalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and cellular maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Many of these tasks have little to do with encoding the currently presented stimulus. To deal with this multitude of tasks, cortex may need to engage in some kind of task switching, which could be reflected in cortical state changes.</p>
<p>Single unit responses to natural scene movie clips were more precise, reliable and sparse in the synchronized than desynchronized state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). The same held for LFP and MUA responses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>0), showing consistency across measures and types of signals. This result is surprising, because it conflicts with recent studies in V1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, primary auditory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (A1) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> of anesthetized rodents. These studies come to the opposite conclusion: responses are more precise and reliable in the <italic>desynchronized</italic> state.</p>
<p>There are many experimental differences that might explain this conflicting result: differences in species (cat vs. rodent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>), anesthetic (isoflurane vs. urethane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, ketamine/xylazine and fentanyl/medetomidine/midazolam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>), desynchronization method (spontaneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> vs. evoked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>), cortical area (V1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> vs. A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and S1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>), stimulus modality (visual vs. auditory and tactile), stimulus type (naturalistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> vs. reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>), and the use of artificial saccades. Since cortical state is likely multidimensional and SI measures only one such dimension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, it is also possible that there were other undetected changes in cortical state in the results presented here but not in those reported in the literature (or vice versa). Such undetected changes might account for some of these opposing results.</p>
<p>The species difference may be the most important. Cats have greater columnar organization of stimulus features in V1 than do rodents: cats have ocular dominance and orientation columns that rodents lack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Up phases in the synchronized state can manifest as waves of spontaneous activity traveling across the cortical surface<sup>3,18-20</sup>, while oriented visual stimuli can evoke standing waves of activity aligned to orientation columns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Presumably, stimulus-evoked standing waves are absent in species that lack orientation columns, including rodents. Perhaps an interaction between these traveling and standing waves of activity in the synchronized state increases the temporal precision and reliability of stimulus-evoked responses in cat but not rodent V1. This hypothesis predicts that responses in the synchronized state of anesthetized ferret and primate V1, which also have orientation columns, should also be more precise and reliable than in the desynchronized state. Conversely, if there is a similar amount of stimulus feature map organization in A1 and S1 of both rodents and higher mammals (i.e., less than in V1 of higher mammals), this hypothesis also predicts that responses of anesthetized cat, ferret and primate A1 and S1 will be more precise and reliable in the desynchronized state, as is the case in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This result may also provide an answer to the question of what functional role, if any, cortical columns might play<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>: to increase response precision and reliability. Further experiments that specifically take cortical state into account in sensory areas of anesthetized higher mammals in response to naturalistic stimulation are required to test these predictions.</p>
<p>More broadly, our results also conflict with the general understanding that responses in awake animals are enhanced during attending behavior (when cortex is more desynchronized) compared to quiescent resting behavior (when cortex is more synchronized)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our results therefore conflict with the hypothesis that synchronized and desynchronized cortical states in anesthetized animals are respectively analogous to quiescent and attending periods in awake animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Perhaps the relationship is more complex than previously thought. Indeed, some studies have suggested that the relationship between brain state, behavioral state, and the fidelity of stimulus representation can be surprisingly complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although only indirectly shown here using global movie motion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref></bold>), higher precision and reliability of responses during the synchronized state suggest that stimuli are better encoded, and hence more easily decoded, in the synchronized state. Why? With more numerous response events, narrower response events that are less likely to overlap with one another, and greater reliability of response events across trials, spike trains in the synchronized state are more distinctive than in the desynchronized state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>-<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref></bold>), and should therefore be easier to decode. This has been shown more explicitly in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, but with the opposite conclusion regarding cortical state.</p>
<p>The synchronized and desynchronized cortical states are two ends of a spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and represent perhaps the simplest division of recording periods into different states. The synchronized state is itself composed of rapidly alternating <sc>up</sc> and <sc>down</sc> phases, and the frequency content of the desynchronized state can be highly heterogeneous (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a&#x2013;e</xref></bold>). A more thorough characterization of especially the desynchronized state is needed. Perhaps it may cluster into one of several sub-states. More detailed partitioning of cortical recordings by more detailed characterization of brain state may reveal more surprises among neural responses.</p></sec>

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Animal experiments followed the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and the Animal Care Committee of the University of British Columbia. After initial sedation, animals were intubated and mechanically ventilated (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at &#x007E; 20 breaths/min to maintain end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> of 30-40 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained by inhalation of 0.5-1.5&#x0025; isoflurane with 70&#x0025; N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub>. Blink and pinna (ear) reflexes and toe pinch were used to ensure sufficient anesthetic depth. During surgical procedures and euthanization, up to 3&#x0025; isoflurane was used. Intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) was used to reduce swelling and salivation. The animal was hydrated by intravascular (IV) infusion of a mixture of lactated Ringer&#x2019;s salt solution (10-20 mL/h), sometimes with added potassium chloride (20 mEq/L) and dextrose (2.5&#x0025;). Heart rate and blood oxygenation were monitored with a pulse-oximeter (Nonin 8600V), with the sensor placed on the tongue or a shaved portion of tail. Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored with a doppler blood pressure monitor (Parks Medical 811-B) on a shaved section of hind leg. Body temperature was maintained at 37&#x00B0;C via closed-loop control with a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus). All vital signs were logged during the course of each experiment. Experiments lasted up to 3 days each.</p>
<p>Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame on an air table, with ear bars coated in topical anesthetic (5&#x0025; lidocaine). Local anesthetic (bupivacaine) was injected subcutaneously around the top of the skull and into the ear muscles before cutting the skin to expose the skull. A roughly 4 &#x00D7; 6 mm craniotomy (1-5 mm lateral and 3-9 mm posterior relative to the centerline and earbar zero, respectively) was drilled with a dental drill (Midwest Stylus, DENTSPLY Professional, Des Plaines, IL) over Brodmann&#x2019;s area 17 and 18. A stereo surgical microscope was used during drilling, removal of meninges, and polytrode insertion. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was used to flush away blood and other detritus from the meninges, and to keep them moist. Ophthalmic surgical sponges (Ultracell Eye Spears, Aspen Surgical, Caledonia, MI) were used to wick blood and excess fluid away. Care was taken to not apply pressure to the brain. A small area of dura was dissected away one layer at a time with an ophthalmic slit knife (Beaver Optimum 15&#x00B0;, BD Medical, Le Pont-de-Claix, France; or ClearCut 3.2 mm, Alcon, Mississauga, ON). A small nick in the pia was then made with the ophthalmic slit knife to allow for polytrode insertion. Prior to insertion, CSF was wicked away from the point of insertion using an ophthalmic surgical sponge to improve unit isolation. Immediately before or after insertion, high purity low temperature agarose (Type III-A, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in ACSF at a concentration of 2.5-4&#x0025; was applied in liquid form at 38-40&#x00B0;C to the craniotomy. This quickly set and eliminated brain movement due to heart beat and respiration. The polytrode was advanced through the tissue using a manual micromanipulator (Model 1460 Electrode Manipulator, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) under visual control until the topmost electrode sites disappeared below the surface of the cortex. Any further advancement through the tissue was made with a hydraulic micromanipulator (Narishige MHW-4, East Meadow, NY), typically 150-300 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m at a time.</p>
<p>Nictitating membranes were retracted with phenylephrine (10&#x0025;, 1-2 drops/eye), and pupils were dilated with tropicamide (0.5&#x0025;, 1-2 drops/eye). Custom-made rigid gas permeable contact lenses (14 mm diameter, 7.8-8.7 mm base curvature, &#x002B;2.00 to &#x002B;4.00 diopter, Harbour City Contact Lens Service, Nanaimo, BC) protected the eyes and refracted the cat&#x2019;s vision to the distance of the stimulus display monitor. To improve focus, 3 mm diameter artificial pupils were placed directly in front of the lenses. To prevent eye drift, one animal (ptc22, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d,e</xref></bold>) was given an initial IV bolus of the systemic paralytic pancuronium bromide (1 mg/kg), and paralysis was maintained by constant rate infusion (0.2 mg/kg/h). For the other two animals (ptc17 &#x0026; ptc18, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a-c</xref></bold>) <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>-bungarotoxin was instead injected retrobulbarly (125 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>M, 0.5 mL per eye) as a local paralytic. Eye position was closely monitored by reverse ophthalmoscopy to ensure stability, using fine blood vessels as landmarks. Receptive fields (mapped with a manually controlled light or dark bar) fell within a few degrees of the area centralis.</p></sec>

<title>Recordings</title>
<p>Extracellular recordings were made from cortical area 17 of 3 anesthetized adult cats (2 male, 1 female), using 54-site single shank (15 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m thick, 207 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m wide, 1138 or 1325 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m long) silicon polytrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI), with electrode sites arranged in 2 or 3 columns in a hexagonal layout (50 or 65 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m spacing). Four recordings were in the left hemisphere and two in the right. In total, four unique hemispheres were recorded from in 3 cats. Polytrodes were inserted perpendicular to the pial surface until the topmost electrode site disappeared below the surface. For 3 of the 6 recordings (not those shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>-<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref></bold>), the polytrode was advanced a further 150-600 <italic>&#x03BC;</italic>m to increase the number of isolatable units. Histological track reconstruction was not successful.</p>
<p>Extracellular voltage waveforms from all 54 electrode sites were unity-gain buffered by a pair of 27-channel headstages (HS-27, Neuralynx, Tucson, AZ), and amplified by a 64-channel 5000 &#x00D7; amplifier with fixed analog filters (FA-I-64, Multichannel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). The first 54 channels of the amplifier were high-pass analog filtered (0.5-6 kHz) for use as spike channels. Data from a subset of 10 of the 54 electrode sites, evenly distributed along the length of the polytrode, were also separately low-pass analog filtered (0.1-150 Hz) for use as LFP channels. All 64 channels were then digitally sampled (25 kHz for the high-pass channels, 1 kHz for the low-pass channels) by a pair of 12-bit 32-channel acquisition boards with an internal gain of 1-8 &#x00D7; (DT3010, Data Translations, Marlboro, MA), controlled by custom software written in Delphi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Spike sorting was done using custom open source software written in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spyke.github.io">http://spyke.github.io</ext-link>). A &#x201C;divide-and-conquer&#x201D; spike sorting method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> translated correlated multisite voltages into action potentials of spatially localized, isolated neurons. This method tracked neurons over periods of many hours despite drift, and distinguished neurons with mean firing rates &#x003C; 0.05 Hz. The steps in this method were: 1) Nyquist interpolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> to 50 kHz; 2) sample-and-hold delay correction; 3) spike detection; 4) initial clustering based on the channel of maximum amplitude; 5) spike alignment within each initial cluster; 6) channel and time range selection around the spikes in each initial cluster; 7) dimension reduction (multichannel PCA, ICA, and/or spike time) into a 3D cluster space; 8) clustering in 3D using a gradient-ascent based clustering algorithm (GAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>; 9) exhaustive pairwise comparisons of each cluster to every other physically near cluster. Each spike was localized in 2D physical space along the polytrode by fitting a 2D spatial Gaussian to the signal amplitudes using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Free parameters were x and y coordinates, and spatial standard deviation.</p></sec>

<title>Visual stimulation</title>
<p>Visual stimuli were presented with millisecond precision using custom open source software written in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dimstim.github.io">http://dimstim.github.io</ext-link>) based on the VisionEgg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://visionegg.org">http://visionegg.org</ext-link>). Stimuli were displayed on a flat 19&#x201D; (36 &#x00D7; 27 cm) CRT monitor (Iiyama HM903DTB) at 800&#x00D7;600 resolution and 200 Hz refresh rate. A high refresh rate was used to prevent artifactual phase locking of neurons in V1 to the screen raster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. One of the 6 recordings (ptc17.tr2b.r58, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>) intentionally used a low 66 Hz refresh rate in an attempt to induce phase-locking, but this did not affect the results presented here. The monitor was placed 57 cm in front of the cat&#x2019;s eyes. At this distance, 1 cm on the screen subtended 1<sup>&#x00B0;</sup> of visual angle, and the monitor subtended horizontal and vertical angles of &#x007E; 36&#x00B0; and 27&#x00B0; respectively. The monitor had a maximum luminance of 116 cd/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Display monitors are typically gamma corrected to linearize output light levels when presenting computer-generated stimuli such as bars and gratings. However, gamma correction was not applied here during natural scene movie presentation because gamma correction already occurs in cameras during the video capture process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Movies were acquired using a hand-held consumer-grade digital camera (Canon PowerShot SD200) at a resolution of 320&#x00D7;240 pixels and 60 frames/s. Movies were filmed close to the ground, in a variety of wooded or grassy locations in Vancouver, BC. Footage consisted mostly of dense grass and foliage with a wide variety of oriented edges. Focus was kept within 2 m and exposure settings were set to automatic. The horizontal angle subtended by the camera lens (51.6&#x00B0;) was measured for proper scaling to match the visual angle subtended by the movie on the stimulus monitor. In addition to the Supplemental Movie, another example movie (corresponding to <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref></bold> and the upper panels of <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref></bold>) is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dimstim.github.io">http://dimstim.github.io</ext-link>. Others are available upon request. Movies contained simulated saccades (peaks in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11a</xref></bold>) of up to 275&#x00B0;/s, generated by manual camera movements in order to mimic gaze shifts (eye and head movements), which can exceed 300&#x00B0;/s in cat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The movies contained little or no forward/backward optic flow. Movies were converted from color to grayscale, and were presented at 66 Hz. Depending on the refresh rate (see above), each frame corresponded to either 1 or 3 screen refreshes. Global motion was calculated for every neighboring pair of movie frames<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> using the OpenCV library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opencv.org">http://opencv.org</ext-link>). Global contrast and luminance were calculated for each frame by taking the standard deviation and mean, respectively, of all the pixel values in each frame.</p></sec>

<title>Cortical state characterization</title>
<p>When constructing spectrograms, 60 Hz mains interference was digitally filtered out with a 0.5 Hz wide elliptic notch filter (negative peak in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>). The SI (L/(L&#x002B;H) ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>) was calculated from the deep-layer LFP spectrogram using 30 s wide overlapping time bins at 5 s resolution. SI thresholds for the synchronized and desynchronized state were &#x003E; 0.85 and &#x003C; 0.8, respectively. However, visual inspection of the spectrogram was used in tandem with the SI, so the above thresholds were not hard limits. Choosing a lower SI threshold to limit analysis to desynchronized periods with a more consistent LFP spectrum did not substantially change results (not shown).</p></sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Response characterization</title>
<p>Spike and LFP analyses were performed using custom open source software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> written in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuropy.github.io">http://neuropy.github.io</ext-link>). PSTHs were calculated by convolving a Gaussian of width 2<italic>&#x03C3;</italic> &#x003D; 20 ms with the spike train collapsed across all trials that fell within the recording period of interest. Detecting response events in a trial raster plot is a clustering problem: how do spike times cluster together into response events, with temporal density significantly greater than background firing levels? As for spike sorting (see above), spike time clustering was performed using the GAC algorithm, with a characteristic neighborhood size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> of 20 ms. Spike time clusters containing less than 5 spikes were discarded. The center of each detected cluster of spike times was matched to the nearest peak in the PSTH. A threshold of <italic>&#x03B8;</italic> &#x003D; <italic>b</italic> &#x002B; 3 Hz was applied to the matching PSTH peak, where <italic>b</italic> &#x003D; 2 median(<italic>x</italic>) is the baseline of each PSTH <italic>x</italic>. Peaks in the PSTH that fell below <italic>&#x03B8;</italic> were discarded, and all others were treated as valid response events. The equation for <italic>&#x03B8;</italic> was derived by trial and error, and visual inspection of all 1870 detected peaks in all 563 PSTHs confirmed that there were no obvious false positive or negative detections. This threshold for detecting peaks in the PSTHs did not cause a sudden cutoff at the low end in the number of spikes per detected response event per trial (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref></bold>). Response event widths were measured as the temporal separation of the middle 68&#x0025; (16th to 84th percentile) of spike times within each cluster.</p>
<p>The mean firing rate of each unit in a given cortical state (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref></bold>) was calculated by its spike count in that state, divided by the state&#x2019;s duration. Mean firing rates therefore included the 1 s period of blank gray screen between movie clip presentations. Units were not required to surpass a mean firing rate threshold for inclusion for analysis. For most analyses, the only requirement was that they were responsive, i.e., that they had at least one detected response event in their PSTH.</p>
<p>The sparseness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> <italic>S</italic> of a signal (whether PSTH, absolute value of LFP, or MUA) was calculated by<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="031765_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> &#x2265; 0 is the signal value in the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> time bin, and n is the number of time bins. Sparseness ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 corresponding to a uniform signal, and 1 corresponding to a signal with all of its energy in a single time bin.</p>
<p>Although the 1 s period of blank screen separating each trial is shown at the end of each recording trace in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>-<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10a,d</xref></bold>, precision, reliability and sparseness measures in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>0 excluded this inter-trial period of blank screen.</p>
<p>Multiunit activity (MUA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><bold>Fig. 10d-f</bold></xref>) was calculated by combining the spike trains of all isolated single units, binning them at 20 ms resolution, and then convolving the resulting multiunit spike count signal with a Gaussian of width 2a &#x003D; 20 ms. MUA coupling was calculated by correlating each unit&#x2019;s PSTH with the trial averaged MUA excluding that unit. MUA coupling was calculated somewhat differently from the original<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> method by taking Pearson&#x2019;s correlation between each PSTH and the MUA.</p></sec></sec></body><back>
