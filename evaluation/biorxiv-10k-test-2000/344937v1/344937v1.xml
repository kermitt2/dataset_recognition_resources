<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme and the decapping activators Pat1, Dhh1, and Lsm1 regulate mRNA decapping, but their mechanistic integration is unknown. We analyzed the gene expression consequences of deleting <italic>PAT1, LSM1,</italic> or <italic>DHH1,</italic> or the <italic>DCP2</italic> C-terminal domain, and found that: i) the Dcp2 C-terminal domain is an effector of both negative and positive regulation; ii) rather than being global activators of decapping, Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 directly target specific subsets of yeast mRNAs and loss of the functions of each of these factors has substantial indirect consequences for genome-wide mRNA expression; and iii) transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 exhibit only partial overlap, are generally translated inefficiently, and, as expected, are targeted to decapping-dependent decay. Our results define the roles of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in decapping of general mRNAs and suggest that these factors may monitor mRNA translation and target unique features of individual mRNAs.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Decapping commits an mRNA to complete degradation and plays an important role in eukaryotic cytoplasmic mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Valkov et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>). Decapping is required for general 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>), nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">He and Jacobson, 2001</xref>), AU-rich element-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fenger-Gron et al., 2005</xref>), microRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006</xref>), and transcript-specific degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dong et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Badis et al., 2004</xref>). In yeast, mRNA decapping is carried out by a single enzyme comprised of a regulatory subunit (Dcp1) and a catalytic subunit (Dcp2). Dcp1 is a small EVH domain protein essential for mRNA decapping <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">She et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beelman et al., 1996</xref>). Dcp2 is a 970-amino acid protein containing a highly conserved Nudix domain at its N-terminus and a large extension at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gaudon et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dunckley and Parker, 1999</xref>). The Dcp2 N-terminal domain is essential for the catalysis of cap removal, but may also have additional regulatory activity, as this domain also contains the binding site for Dcp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">She et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>). The decapping role of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain is largely unknown. However, our recent experiments reveal that this domain includes both negative and positive regulatory elements that control both the substrate specificity and the activation of the decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme, mRNA decapping also requires the functions of specific regulators commonly dubbed &#x201C;decapping activators&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>). A large number of decapping activators have been identified in yeast and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>), and these factors appear to target distinct classes of mRNA substrates. Pat1, Dhh1, and the Lsm1-7 complex are required for decapping of general wild-type mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>), and NMD-specific regulators (Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3) are required for decapping of nonsense-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">He and Jacobson, 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nicholson and Muhlemann, 2010</xref>). Edc3 manifests the most fastidious substrate specificity, being required for decapping of only the yeast <italic>YRA1</italic> pre-mRNA and <italic>RPS28B</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">He et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dong et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Badis et al., 2004</xref>). All of these decapping activators are conserved from yeast to humans, but their precise functions in mRNA decapping regulation are largely unknown. The two major functions proposed for yeast decapping activators, translational repression and decapping enzyme activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>), are still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arribere et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Yeast decapping activators exhibit highly specific interactions with each other and with the decapping enzyme. Pat1 interacts with both Dhh1 and the Lsm1-7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sharif and Conti, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3 interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">He et al., 1997</xref>), and Edc3 interacts with Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>). Pat1, Upf1, and Edc3 also interact with specific binding motifs in the large C-terminal domain of Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harigaya et al., 2010</xref>). These interaction data and additional observations led us to propose a new model for regulation of mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>) in which different decapping activators form distinct decapping complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, each of which has a unique substrate specificity that targets a subset of yeast mRNAs. To test aspects of this model, and to further understand the roles of Pat1, Dhh1, and the Lsm1-7 complex in general mRNA decapping we have analyzed the effects of deletions of the <italic>PAT1</italic>, <italic>LSM1</italic>, or <italic>DHH1</italic> genes and the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain on transcriptome-wide mRNA accumulation. Our results reveal a critical role for the Dcp2 C-terminal domain in regulating mRNA decapping, demonstrate that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 control the decapping of specific subsets of yeast mRNAs, and uncover substantial indirect consequences of mutations in genes encoding components of the decapping apparatus.</p>

<sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Elimination of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain causes significant changes in genome-wide mRNA expression</title>
<p>We previously identified multiple regulatory elements in the large C-terminal domain of Dcp2, including one negative element that inhibits <italic>in vivo</italic> decapping activity and a set of positive elements that promote both substrate specificity and decapping activation. The latter appear to operate by binding to specific decapping activators such as Upf1, Edc3, and Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). To extend our previous study and to further assess the roles of these Dcp2 regulatory elements in <italic>in vivo</italic> decapping control, we analyzed the effect of C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 on transcriptome-wide mRNA accumulation. RNA-Seq was used to analyze transcript populations in wild-type yeast cells and in cells harboring the previously characterized <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). This allele produces a Dcp2 decapping enzyme that contains only the first 245 amino acids of the protein, and appears to have constitutively activated and indiscriminate decapping activity, at least with respect to the limited number of mRNAs analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>). As with any mutation, truncation of Dcp2 could have a direct effect on mRNA decapping, or it could have an indirect effect on overall gene expression. To identify those transcripts directly affected by C-terminal truncation of Dcp2, we constructed two additional isogenic strains with severely compromised decapping activity and included these two strains in our RNA-Seq experiments. These strains, dubbed <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic>, harbor the same <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> allele but each also contains one additional function-inactivating mutation in an active site residue of the Dcp2 Nudix domain, i.e., glutamate (E) to glutamine (Q) substitutions at codon positions 153 and 198, respectively. E153 of Dcp2 has been shown to function as a general base during the hydrolysis reaction and E198 is involved in Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> coordination within the Nudix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aglietti et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>E153Q</italic> and <italic>E198Q</italic> mutations essentially eliminate the decapping activity of Dcp2 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aglietti et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>RNA-Seq libraries prepared from wild-type cells and from the isogenic strains harboring the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic>, <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245,</italic> or <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> alleles showed good read count distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and notable consistency between biological replicates, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Utilizing previously described data analysis pipelines for transcript quantitation and assessment of differential expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>), we identified the transcripts that were differentially expressed in each of the mutant strains relative to the wild-type strain. The decapping-deficient <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strains exhibited significant numbers of transcripts that were differentially expressed. We identified 1921 up-regulated and 1845 down-regulated transcripts in the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> strain, and 1346 up-regulated and 1428 down-regulated transcripts in the <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>, D). Given the general requirement for the decapping enzyme in yeast mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>), the detection of a large number of up-regulated transcripts in these two strains was not surprising, i.e., the up-regulated transcripts are most likely <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates of the yeast decapping enzyme. In support of this interpretation, the up-regulated transcript lists from these strains contain all our previously characterized individual decapping substrates and also exhibited highly significant overlap with the up-regulated transcript lists from <italic>dcp1&#x0394;</italic>, <italic>dcp2&#x0394;</italic>, <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic>, and <italic>upf1/2/3&#x0394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, the finding that a large number of transcripts was also down-regulated in the two decapping-inactive strains was surprising. Similar observations were also made in our recent RNA-Seq analyses of <italic>dcp1&#x0394;</italic> and <italic>dcp2&#x0394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that general inhibition of mRNA decapping may also have severe secondary effects on transcriptome-wide mRNA accumulation.</p>

<p>Examination of the up- and down-regulated transcript lists from the two catalytically inactive strains revealed a significant overlap, but also a notable difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>). The two strains share 1186 up-regulated and 1362 down-regulated transcripts. However, the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> strain yielded 575 more up-regulated and 417 more down-regulated transcripts than the <italic>dcp2E198Q-N245</italic> strain. To explore whether there was a significant difference in the expression patterns between these two strains, we applied the same differential expression pipeline but compared the <italic>dcp2E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2E198Q-N245</italic> libraries directly. This analysis revealed only 21 differentially expressed transcripts between these two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, leftmost panel) From this result, we conclude that there is no fundamental difference in expression patterns between the two strains. However, because the two strains harbor different <italic>dcp2</italic> alleles, the encoded decapping enzymes may have slightly different albeit significantly reduced activities. Thus, some subtle differences in levels of expression may actually exist for a large number of transcripts between the two strains, as we noticed in our validation experiments (see below). The subtle differences in levels of expression for these transcripts were likely captured in the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> vs <italic>WT</italic> but not in the <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> vs <italic>WT</italic> comparison.</p>
<p>Elimination of the entire C-terminal domain of Dcp2 significantly altered genome-wide mRNA expression. Compared to WT cells, a total of 1530 transcripts were differentially expressed in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells: 616 transcripts showed up-regulation and 914 transcripts showed down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>). To assess the specific effect of the C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 on mRNA decapping, we compared the expression pattern of the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain to the patterns of the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>). Transcripts differentially expressed in these three strains shared a partial overlap, but also exhibited notable differences. A significant fraction of transcripts differentially expressed in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain (324 out of 616 for the up-regulated, and 650 out 914 for the down-regulated) had concordant up- or down-regulation in the catalytically inactive strains. Interestingly, the majority of transcripts differentially expressed in the catalytically inactive strains (1567 out of 1891 for the up-regulated, and 1261 out of 1911 for the down-regulated) had unchanged levels in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain. Furthermore, a significant fraction of transcripts differentially expressed in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain (292 out 616 for the up-regulated, and 264 out of 914 for the down-regulated) had unchanged levels in the catalytically inactive strains. Together, these results indicate that the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain and the two catalytically inactive strains have largely different global mRNA expression patterns and suggest that the C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 does not block general mRNA decapping, but causes deregulation of decapping for specific mRNAs. To further support this conclusion, we carried direct pairwise comparisons between the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> and the <italic>dcp2E-153Q-N245</italic> or <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> libraries. The <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain yielded 1658 up-regulated and 1690 down-regulated transcripts compared to the <italic>dcp2E153Q-N245</italic> strain, and 1113 up-regulated 1090 down-regulated compared to the <italic>dcp2E198Q-N245</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle and right panels), further illustrating these differences.</p>

<sec id="s2b"><title>Elimination of the C-terminal domain of Dcp2 deregulates but does not block mRNA decapping</title>
<p>Our comparison of the transcripts differentially expressed between <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells and cells expressing the two decapping-deficient alleles suggested that the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> truncation causes deregulated decapping but not decapping inhibition. To explore this concept further, we examined correlations of the transcriptome-wide profiles of all transcripts in the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain and in yeast strains severely comprised in decapping activity (<italic>dcp2E-153Q-N245</italic> or <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells) or strains lacking decapping or 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease activities (<italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;,</italic> and <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> cells). As controls, we also did pairwise comparisons of the profiles for the latter group of strains. In this analysis, profiling data for the <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;,</italic> and <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> strains were from our recently published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). Because the <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;,</italic> and <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> libraries were prepared at a different time, to improve the consistency, we used the relative levels (i.e., the fold changes relative to the corresponding <italic>WT</italic> control) of each transcript in all these strains in our analyses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the <italic>dcp1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>dcp2</italic>&#x0394; strains, or the <italic>dcp2E153Q-N245</italic> and <italic>dcp2E198Q-N245</italic> strains, showed excellent correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients = 0.868 and 0.932, respectively). The <italic>dcp1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>dcp2</italic>&#x0394; strains also showed good correlation with the <italic>dcp2E153Q-N245, dcp2E198Q-N245</italic> or <italic>xrn1</italic>&#x0394; strains (Pearson correlation coefficients = 0.812, 0.805, 0.748 for <italic>dcp1</italic>&#x0394; and 0.772, 0.789, 0.734 for <italic>dcp2</italic>&#x0394; strains, respectively). In contrast, the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain exhibited only modest correlation with each of the <italic>dcp1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>dcp2</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>dcp2E153Q-N245, dcp2E198Q-N245,</italic> or <italic>xrn1</italic>&#x0394; strains (Pearson correlation coefficients = 0.371, 0.345, 0.423, 0.421, and 0.379). These results indicate that the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> strain has a significantly different expression profile from yeast strains severely deficient in or lacking decapping or 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease activities, further arguing that the C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 deregulates but does not block mRNA decapping.</p>

Yeast cells harboring a deletion of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain exhibit a significantly different genome-wide expression pattern from cells severely comprised in decapping activity or completely lacking decapping or 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease activities. Scatterplot matrices were used to compare the relative levels of all transcripts in the yeast transcriptome in different mutant strains. The relative levels of individual mRNAs in each of the mutant strains were determined by comparisons to the appropriate wild-type strain. Data for the <italic>dcp1&#x0394;</italic>, <italic>dcp2&#x0394;</italic>, and <italic>xrn1</italic>&#x0394; strains were from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>B. Yeast cells harboring a deletion of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain exhibit accelerated and indiscriminate decapping of mRNAs. Eleven representative transcripts (nine typical decapping substrates and two atypical decapping substrates) from the group of transcripts down-regulated uniquely in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells were selected and their levels of expression in the indicated strains were analyzed by northern blotting. In each case, a specific random-primed probe was hybridized to the blot and the <italic>SCR1</italic> transcript served as a loading control. The relative levels of specific transcripts in the mutant strains were determined by comparisons to their levels in the wild-type strain (indicated by the values under each blot).

<p>To validate our RNA-Seq results and to assess the potential mechanisms of decapping deregulation caused by elimination of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain, we focused on a group of 264 transcripts that were down-regulated uniquely in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the levels of transcripts from this group were not altered in <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> or <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> cells, we reasoned that their decreased accumulation in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells was likely to be caused by accelerated or indiscriminate decapping by a constitutively activated Dcp2 decapping enzyme which had lost its negative regulation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether elimination of <italic>XRN1,</italic> a gene encoding the 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease that functions downstream of decapping, can restore the levels of the down-regulated transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells. To assess the specificity of <italic>XRN1</italic> deletion, we also analyzed the effects of elimination of <italic>SKI2</italic> or <italic>SKI7</italic> on the accumulation of the down-regulated transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells. <italic>SKI2</italic> encodes a 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; RNA helicase, <italic>SKI7</italic> encodes a GTPase, and both gene products are required for exosome-mediated 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>). We constructed a set of yeast double mutant strains harboring the <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> allele and deletions of the <italic>XRN1</italic>, <italic>SKI2</italic>, or <italic>SKI7</italic> genes. As additional controls, we also constructed yeast double mutants harboring the <italic>dcp2-E153Q-N245</italic> or <italic>dcp2-E198Q-N245</italic> alleles and a deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic>. We selected eleven representative transcripts from the down-regulated group and employed northern blotting to analyze the decay phenotypes of these transcripts in the respective single and double mutant strains. Among the eleven selected transcripts, nine (<italic>GDH1, ARL1, DAL3, YGL117W, RPS9A</italic>, <italic>SUC2, CPA1, HIS4,</italic> and <italic>SER3</italic>) are typical decapping substrates and two (<italic>HCA1</italic> pre-mRNA and <italic>HSP82</italic> mRNA) are atypical decapping substrates, i.e., the latter are normally subject to degradation by other decay pathways. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, all eleven transcripts manifested decreased levels in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells compared to wild-type cells. Deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> completely restored the mRNA levels in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells for almost all transcripts. In contrast, elimination of <italic>SKI2</italic> or <italic>SKI7</italic> had no effect on mRNA levels for each of the eleven transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells. These results validate our RNA-Seq analyses and demonstrate that decreased accumulation of these representative transcripts in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells is indeed caused by accelerated or opportunistic decapping of the mRNAs. This experiment provides direct experimental evidence that Dcp2 is subject to negative regulation through its C-terminal domain and that loss of this negative regulation causes indiscriminate mRNA decapping.</p>

<p>To assess the roles of the general decapping activators Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in mRNA decay, we generated yeast strains harboring single deletions of the <italic>PAT1, LSM1,</italic> or <italic>DHH1</italic> genes and analyzed the expression profiles of the resulting <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strains by RNA-Seq. The RNA-Seq libraries from these strains showed good read count distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and notable consistency between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>To explore the functional relationships of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in mRNA decay, we compared the up- and down-regulated transcript lists from the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strains. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and C, transcripts differentially expressed in the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains exhibited highly significant overlap. About 84&#x0025; of the up-regulated transcripts (864 out of 1031) and 77&#x0025; of the down-regulated transcripts (583 out of 756) were shared by these two strains. Transcripts differentially expressed in the <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strain exhibited partial overlap with those in the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains. About 50&#x0025; of the up-regulated transcripts (542 out of 1098) and 43&#x0025; of the down-regulated transcripts (342 out of 788) in the <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strain were shared by the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;or <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains. In addition, 482 transcripts were commonly up-regulated and 290 commonly down-regulated in all three strains. Given the substantial overlap of differentially expressed transcripts in the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains, and the physical interactions between Pat1 and the Lsm1-7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>), we tested whether Pat1 and Lsm1 controlled the expression of the same set of transcripts. Utilizing the same differential expression analysis pipeline, we compared the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; libraries directly. The <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains manifested remarkable consistency in their expression profiles over the entire transcriptome, with only four transcripts differentially expressed between the two strains, two of which were caused by the respective gene deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, leftmost panel, red dots). Direct comparisons were also applied to the <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; or <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; libraries. This analysis revealed significant differences in the expression profiles between the <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; or <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, last two panels). The <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strain yielded1332 up-regulated and 874 down-regulated transcripts compared to the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; strain, and 1385 up-regulated and 1037 down-regulated transcripts compared to the <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strain.</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 target specific subsets of yeast transcripts with overlapping substrate specificity. Pat1 and Lsm1 appear to function together and target the same set of transcripts in yeast cells. Dhh1 appears to have distinct functions from Pat1 and Lsm1and targets a set of transcripts that only partially overlaps with those regulated by Pat1 and Lsm1.</p>

<sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of transcripts uniquely and commonly targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1</title>
<p>Based on the well established <italic>in vivo</italic> functions and <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tharun et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>), we considered the up-regulated transcripts in the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strains to be direct substrates of these decapping activators for the most part, and the respective down-regulated transcripts in these strains to arise indirectly as a consequence of general defects in mRNA decapping (see above). To evaluate the reliability of these propositions, we examined the expression patterns of these up- and down-regulated transcripts in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;,</italic> and <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> cells as well as in <italic>dcp2-N245, dcp2E-153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells. Further, to gain insight into the overlapping vs. distinct regulatory activities of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1, we divided the differentially expressed transcripts from <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells into six distinct subgroups based on their decay phenotypes and examined the distribution of the relative levels of transcripts from these subgroups in each of the mutant strains. The up-regulated transcripts were divided into three non-overlapping subgroups: Up-o-d, up-regulated only in the <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strain (556 transcripts); Up-o-pl, up-regulated only in the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains (382 transcripts); and Up-a-pld, up-regulated in all three deletion strains (482 transcripts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, the down-regulated transcripts were also divided into three non-overlapping subgroups: Down-o-d, down-regulated only in the <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strain (446 transcripts); Down-o-pl, down-regulated only in the <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; strains (293 transcripts); and Down-a-pld, down-regulated in all three deletion strains (290 transcripts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Transcripts from the six subgroups had distinct expression patterns in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, xrn1&#x0394;, dcp2-N245, dcp2-E-153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2-E-198Q-N245</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>-F). Transcripts from two of the up-regulated subgroups, Up-o-d and Up-a-pld, exhibited similar expression patterns and had significantly increased levels of expression (relative to the WT strain) in all six mutant strains. Transcripts from the third up-regulated subgroup, Up-o-pl, exhibited a slightly different expression pattern and had significantly increased levels in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, dcp2E-153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells, marginally increased levels in <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> cells, but unaltered levels in <italic>dcp2-N245</italic> cells. These results show that transcripts from the three up-regulated subgroups are all sensitive to the loss of decapping activity, indicating that they are <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates of the decapping enzyme and the general 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay pathway. The marginal effect of <italic>XRN1</italic> deletion on the expression of the transcripts from the Up-o-pl subgroup may suggest that, once decapped, a significant fraction of transcripts from this subgroup can also be efficiently degraded by the 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; decay pathway. Transcripts from the three down-regulated subgroups exhibited two different expression patterns. Transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups had significantly decreased levels in all six mutant strains. This result shows that transcripts from these two subgroups are sensitive to both partial and complete loss of decapping activity as well as to complete loss of the 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease activity. The concordant down-regulation observed for these transcripts in all our mRNA decay mutant strains strongly argues that they are indirectly controlled by the general 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay activities. Transcripts from the down-regulated Down-o-pl subgroup had significantly decreased levels in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, dcp2E</italic>-<italic>153Q</italic>-<italic>N245</italic>, and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells but increased levels in <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> and <italic>dcp2</italic>-<italic>N245</italic> cells. The increased expression of these transcripts in response to deletion of <italic>XRN1</italic> and C-terminal truncation of Dcp2 suggests that they are also <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates of the decapping enzyme and thus are likely controlled by Pat1 and Lsm1 directly. The decreased levels of these transcripts in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, dcp2E</italic>-<italic>153Q</italic>-<italic>N245</italic>, and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells suggests that when decapping is completely blocked, these transcripts may be more efficiently degraded by the 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; decay pathway.</p>

<p>Collectively, these results indicate that transcripts from all three up-regulated subgroups and one of the down-regulated subgroups (Down-o-pl) are substrates of the decapping enzyme and thus are likely to be direct targets of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. In contrast, transcripts from the other two down-regulated subgroups (Down-o-d and Down-a-pld) appear to be controlled indirectly by the general 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay activities and thus are not the direct targets of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. To obtain further support for this conclusion, we analyzed the pattern of the codon protection index for transcripts in each of these six subgroups. This index is a measure of the degree of a transcript&#x2019;s co-translational 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay and is defined as the ratio of sequencing reads in the ribosome protected frame over the average reads of the non-protected frames of the 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay intermediates from a specific transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). Values greater than 1 are indicators of co-translational 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, transcripts from the Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, Up-a-pld, and Down-o-pl subgroups all had median codon protection index values greater than 1. In contrast, transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups both had median codon protection index values less than 1. These data strengthen our conclusion on the separation of differentially expressed transcripts into direct target and non-target categories. Based on their expression patterns, we suggest that transcripts from the Up-o-d subgroup are targeted by Dhh1, transcripts from the Up-o-pl and Down-o-pl subgroups are targeted by Pat1 and Lsm1, and transcripts from the Up-a-pld subgroup are targeted by all three factors.</p>

<p>To validate the results from our RNA-Seq analyses and to assess the proposed decay mechanisms for transcripts in different subgroups controlled by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1, we selected 34 transcripts (representing mRNAs from each subgroup) and analyzed both their levels and patterns of expression by northern blotting. In this experiment, we analyzed mRNA levels in wild-type, <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strains, but also included <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, xrn1&#x0394;, dcp2-N245, dcp2E-153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> strains to assess each transcript&#x2019;s sensitivity to 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay, and <italic>upf1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>edc3</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>scd6</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>ski2</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>ski7</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>ski2</italic>&#x0394;<italic>ski7</italic>&#x0394; strains to serve as negative controls. Our northern analyses confirmed the expression patterns for 30 out of 34 selected transcripts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, four transcripts (<italic>CIT2</italic>, <italic>SDS23</italic>, <italic>HOS2</italic>, and <italic>PYK2</italic>) from the Up-o-d subgroup all had increased levels only in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells but not in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; cells; four transcripts (<italic>DIF1</italic>, <italic>AGA1</italic>, <italic>BUR6</italic>, and <italic>LSM3</italic>) from the Up-o-pl subgroup all had increased levels only in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; cells but not in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells; ten transcripts (<italic>HXT6, GPH1, HXK1, CHA1, RTC3, NQM1, PGM2</italic>, <italic>TMA10, GAD1,</italic> and <italic>SPG4</italic>) from the Up-a-pld subgroup all had increased levels in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells; and two transcripts (<italic>MUP3</italic> and <italic>GTT2</italic>) from the Down-o-pl subgroup both had decreased levels in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; cells, but not in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells. Importantly, the twenty transcripts from these four subgroups all had increased levels in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, dcp2E-153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells, and nineteen out twenty transcripts (except <italic>GTT2</italic>) also had increased levels in <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> cells. These results support our proposition that transcripts from these four subgroups are all <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates of the decapping enzyme and provide direct evidence that these transcripts are indeed degraded by the general 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; decay pathway. Also as expected, three transcripts (<italic>RPP1A</italic>, <italic>TMA19</italic>, and <italic>GPD2</italic>) from the Down-a-pld subgroup all had decreased levels in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells. Consistent with the idea that these transcripts were affected indirectly as a consequence of a general defect in decapping, all three transcripts also had decreased levels in in <italic>dcp1&#x0394;, dcp2&#x0394;, dcp2E-153Q-N245,</italic> and <italic>dcp2E-198Q-N245</italic> cells. Interestingly, these three transcripts only had slightly increased levels in <italic>xrn1&#x0394;</italic> cells, suggesting they are mostly degraded by the 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; decay pathway. Five transcripts (<italic>YIL164C</italic>, <italic>THI22</italic>, <italic>EST1</italic>, <italic>TRP1-1</italic>, and <italic>ALR2</italic>) from the Down-o-d subgroup had decreased levels only in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells but not in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<p>The four transcripts that could not be confirmed deviated from expectations for different reasons: one had an extremely low expression level and could not be effectively verified (<italic>SFG1</italic>), one had complex isoforms that are not annotated in the genome releases (<italic>FRE3</italic>), and therefore not used in our statistical procedures, and the other two (<italic>ASC1</italic> premRNA and mRNA) were most likely bioinformatics false positives due to multiple alignment artifacts of sequence reads to the spliced and unspliced isoforms from the same locus.</p>

<sec id="s2f"><title>Transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are all translated inefficiently</title>
<p>Given the intimate linkage of mRNA translation and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mishima and Tomari, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Roy and Jacobson, 2013</xref>), and to gain insight into the roles of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in decapping regulation, we sought to identify any unique properties associated with the translation of transcripts controlled by these three factors. To this end, we analyzed the pattern and distribution of the average codon optimality score, the average ribosome density, and the estimated protein abundance for transcripts from the six subgroups of differentially expressed mRNAs in <italic>pat1&#x0394;</italic>, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1&#x0394;</italic> cells. In this analysis, the average codon optimality score of individual transcripts was based on the scores defined by Pechmann and Frydman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pechmann and Frydman, 2013</xref>) and these scores are in fact the normalized tRNA adaptation index in which mRNA abundances are used to correct for the number of codons vs. number of tRNA genes. Ribosomal densities were derived from published ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data from wild-type yeast cells grown under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Young et al., 2015</xref>). Protein abundance levels were obtained from the curated PaxDb (Protein Abundances Across Organisms) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and comprise the scaled aggregated estimates over several proteomic data sets.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures. 6A-C</xref>, transcripts from the three up-regulated Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, and Up-a-pld subgroups exhibited similar and consistent data patterns: they all had relatively low average codon optimality scores, high ribosome densities, and low protein levels. These observations indicate that transcripts from these three subgroups are all translated inefficiently, most likely because of less efficient translation elongation. Transcripts from the three down-regulated subgroups exhibited two different data patterns. Transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups exhibited one consistent data pattern: they all had relatively high average codon optimality scores, low ribosome densities, and high protein levels. These observations suggest that transcripts from these two subgroups are translated efficiently, a characteristic probably reflecting highly efficient translation elongation. Transcripts from the Down-o-pl subgroup had a distinct data pattern: they had relatively low average codon optimality scores, low ribosome densities, and but relatively high protein levels. These observations suggest that transcripts from this subgroup may be inefficiently translated, but have relative long mRNA half-lives. Together, these results indicate that transcripts targeted directly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are all translated less efficiently. In contrast, transcripts controlled indirectly by these three factors appear to be translated more efficiently.</p>

<p>Notably, although the Dhh1 function in mRNA decay was recently suggested to be linked to codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>), our analyses revealed that the average codon optimality score of individual transcripts was not a reliable predictor of the Dhh1 requirement for their decay. Transcripts targeted by Dhh1 (from the Up-o-d and Up-a-pld subgroups) had a low but broad range of average codon optimality scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, in that range, there were also thousands of transcripts that were not targeted by Dhh1, including transcripts uniquely targeted by Pat1 and Lsm1 (from the Up-o-pl and Down-o-pl subgroups), as well as transcripts targeted by none of these three factors. This raises the possibility that additional decay factors may be responsible for targeting these transcripts.</p>

<sec id="s2g"><title>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 have non-overlapping functions with NMD factors in mRNA decapping regulation</title>
<p>To further define the roles of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in mRNA decapping regulation, we examined the functional relationships between these three factors and the NMD factors Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3. We compared the transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 to those targeted by the three Upfs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, transcripts from the Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, and Up-a-pld subgroups all had only minimal and insignificant overlap with NMD substrates. In addition, as revealed by a two-dimensional hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially expressed transcripts, <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells also had profiles distinct from those of <italic>upf1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>upf2</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>upf3</italic>&#x0394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results indicate that the general decapping activators Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 have roles that are distinct from and non-overlapping with those of the NMD factors in mRNA decapping regulation.</p>

<sec id="s2h"><title>Deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> promotes the degradation of a fraction of NMD substrates</title>
<p>We recently demonstrated that yeast decapping activators form distinct complexes with the decapping enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), suggesting that different decapping activators may compete with each other for binding to the decapping enzyme. One implication of this notion is that in addition to providing targeting specificity for the decapping enzyme, decapping activators can also control each other&#x2019;s activities indirectly by limiting or promoting the free pool of available decapping enzyme. A testable prediction of this dynamic mRNA decapping regulation is that, in addition to stabilizing its targeted transcripts, deletion of a specific activator may also promote the degradation of substrates of the alternative mRNA decay pathways. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the down-regulated subgroups from the differentially expressed transcripts in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells may contain NMD substrates. This analysis revealed that the three subgroups exhibited significantly different enrichment patterns for NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The Down-o-d subgroup (transcripts down-regulated only in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells) was enriched for NMD substrates (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, p=7.3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>). In contrast, the Down-o-pl (transcripts down-regulated only in in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394; and <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394; cells) was depleted of NMD substrates (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, p=6.2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>). Finally, the Down-a-pld subgroup (transcripts down-regulated in all three deletion strains) showed neither enrichment for nor depletion of NMD substrates (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test p=0.12). These results provide additional evidence that transcripts from the Down-o-pl subgroup are direct targets of Pat1 and Lsm1, and show that the Down-o-d subgroup contains a fraction of NMD-targeted transcripts. To validate the latter observation, we selected five representative NMD substrates that were also down-regulated in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells and analyzed their expression levels and patterns in a set of yeast strains described above. As expected, northern analyses showed that all five transcripts (<italic>YIL164C</italic>, <italic>THI22</italic>, <italic>EST1</italic>, <italic>TRP1-1</italic>, and <italic>ALR2</italic>) had decreased levels in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells but increased levels in <italic>upf1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>dcp1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>dcp2</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>xrn1</italic>&#x0394; cells (Figure7D, left panel). The decreased accumulation for these five transcripts in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells largely resulted from degradation by NMD as elimination of <italic>UPF1</italic> from <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells caused substantial increases (ranging from 4.0- to 21.6-fold) in the expression levels of each of these five transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, we also observed that <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; <italic>upf1</italic>&#x0394; cells consistently accumulated lower levels (ranging from 28&#x0025; to 81&#x0025;) than <italic>upf1</italic>&#x0394; cells for each of these five transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right panel), suggesting that deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> can also promote NMD-independent degradation of these transcripts. Together, these results indicate that deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> can promote the degradation of a subset of NMD substrates by both NMD-dependent and NMD-independent mechanisms, thus arguing that decapping activators can indeed exert indirect control of each other&#x2019;s activities in mRNA decapping.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s3a"><title>Dcp2 C-terminal domain imparts critical <italic>in vivo</italic> regulatory activities in mRNA decapping</title>
<p>The yeast Dcp2 decapping enzyme subunit has a modular structure encompassing a conserved 245-amino acid N-terminal Nudix catalytic domain and a 725-amino acid C-terminal extension. While the catalytic function of the N-terminal domain in cap removal is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Floor et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">She et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">She et al., 2006</xref>), the decapping role of the large Dcp2 C-terminal domain remains to be clarified. Here, we provide genetic evidence that the Dcp2 C-terminal domain imparts important regulatory activities to the decapping enzyme, thus playing a critical role in regulating mRNA decapping <italic>in vivo</italic>. Elimination of the C-terminal domain altered the expression of more than a quarter of yeast&#x2019;s protein-coding genes and led to both up- and down-regulation of specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures. 1B, C</xref>). A key observation supporting a predominantly regulatory role for the C-terminal domain is that transcripts differentially expressed in cells lacking the Dcp2 C-terminal domain only exhibited limited correlation with those differentially expressed in cells whose decapping activity was either severely comprised or essentially absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Our recent experiments revealed that the Dcp2 C-terminal domain harbors both negative and positive regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), leading us to propose that the decapping enzyme is subject to both negative and positive regulation. Recent biochemical data also supports this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Paquette et al., 2018</xref>). Our expression profiling of yeast cells lacking the Dcp2 C-terminal domain provides direct experimental evidence for both aspects of this hypothesis. Negative regulation of the decapping enzyme is supported by the observations that deletion of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain led to decreases in the abundance of hundreds of specific transcripts, and that this down-regulation was dependent on maintenance of Dcp2&#x2019;s catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Importantly, the vast majority of these down-regulated transcripts were not normal decapping substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that deletion of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain eliminates an inhibitory function of the domain and leads to uncontrolled and accelerated mRNA decapping by a constitutively activated and opportunistic Dcp2. Evidence for positive regulation of the decapping enzyme is provided by the observation that elimination of the Dcp2 C-terminal domain also caused up-regulation of hundreds of specific transcripts. As this group of transcripts also exhibited concordant up-regulation in decapping-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), it is likely that the observed up-regulation originates from a deficiency in mRNA decapping caused by loss of a positive regulatory function. Collectively, these observations indicate that the C-terminal domain of Dcp2 encodes important regulatory activities and that loss of these regulatory activities can have direct consequences on decapping of hundreds of specific mRNAs.</p>
<p>Over the past decade mechanistic investigations of mRNA decapping regulation have largely been focused on the 245-amino acid N-terminal domain of Dcp2, with essentially all biochemical and structural studies using this C-terminally truncated fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mugridge et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borja et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Floor et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">She et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deshmukh et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">She et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wurm et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wurm et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Charenton et al., 2016</xref>). This Dcp2 fragment binds to Dcp1, but lacks the binding sites for most decapping activators, including Pat1, Edc3, and Upf1 (He and Jacobson, 2015). Our genetic experiments here reveal that this N-terminal fragment of Dcp2 encodes a constitutively active decapping enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic> that can target a variety of mRNAs including those that normally use or do not use decapping-dependent mechanisms in their degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B-C</xref>). Accordingly, current models of mRNA decapping regulation based on the Dcp2 N-terminal domain may be informative with respect to the catalytic step of decapping, but most likely do not reflect complex aspects of mRNA decapping regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> such as substrate selection and decapping enzyme activation.</p>

<sec id="s3b"><title>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 target subsets of yeast transcripts with overlapping substrate specificity</title>
<p>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 have long been considered as general mRNA decapping activators and their functions are usually thought to be required for decapping of most wild-type mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tharun and Parker, 1999</xref>). Contrary to this expectation, our expression profiling experiments revealed that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are only required for decapping of a subset of transcripts in yeast cells and suggested that these factors have highly specific functions in controlling mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with strong <italic>in vivo</italic> physical interaction and shared <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sharif and Conti, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouveret et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chowdhury et al., 2007</xref>), our results indicate that Pat1 and Lsm1 function together (probably as a Pat1-Lsm1-7 complex) to target the same set of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>-E). Dhh1 targets a different set of transcripts that only partially overlaps with those targeted by both Pat1 and Lsm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>The partial overlap between transcripts commonly targeted by Pat1 and Lsm1 and those targeted by Dhh1 strongly indicates that these three decapping activators have distinct functions in mRNA decapping regulation and that decapping of individual mRNAs likely has different functional requirements for Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. For example, we identified transcripts regulated by Dhh1 but not by Pat1 and Lsm1 (the Up-o-d subgroup), transcripts regulated by Pat1 and Lsm1 but not by Dhh1 (the Up-o-pl and Down-o-pl subgroups), and transcripts regulated by all three factors (the Up-a-pld subgroup). Since the degradation of transcripts controlled by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 individually or in combination is dependent on the Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme and the Xrn1 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) the transcripts in these three groups are most likely <italic>bona fide</italic> decapping substrates. Accordingly, our observation that decapping of individual mRNAs can have different requirements for Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 suggests that mRNA decapping is a multi-step process and that Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are likely to function at different steps of the decapping pathway. Given the genetic and physical interactions between Dhh1 and the Not1-Ccr4 deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Maillet and Collart, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hata et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ozgur et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>), and the physical interaction between Pat1 and Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Charenton et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), one possibility is that Dhh1 promotes deadenylation and that Pat1 and Lsm1 recruit the decapping enzyme.</p>
<p>Transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 all appear to be translated inefficiently as they have relatively low average codon optimality scores, high ribosomal occupancy, and low protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These observations indicate that the functions of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in regulating decapping are probably linked to mRNA translation, a conclusion consistent with a recent study linking Dhh1 function in mRNA decay to translation elongation through codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). However, our results indicate that average codon optimality scores of individual mRNAs do not correlate well with a Dhh1 requirement for their decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Hence, the identity and distribution of non-optimal codons in an mRNA may influence the targeting specificity by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1.</p>
<p>Over past two decades models for the general functions of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in yeast mRNA decapping were largely generated by assessing the fate of the transcripts derived from two key reporter gene constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>). One reporter codes for the unstable <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA and the other codes for the stable <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA. Both of these transcripts are in the datasets presented here and our results show that the <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA is regulated by Pat1 and Lsm1, but not by Dhh1, and that the <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA is not regulated by any of the three factors. These observations highlight potential drawbacks to the use of reporter gene assays and lead to uncertainty about existing models. Most importantly, since both reporter mRNAs are not regulated by Dhh1 it becomes difficult to justify models in which Dhh1 has a direct role in decapping of these transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coller et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3c"><title>Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 also have indirect roles in controlling genome-wide mRNA expression</title>
<p>Our expression profiling experiments revealed that, in addition to targeting specific mRNAs for decapping, Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 also have indirect roles in controlling mRNA expression in yeast and that eliminating the functions of any of these three factors can have severe consequences for global mRNA accumulation. Unexpectedly, we found that deletions of <italic>PAT1</italic>, <italic>LSM1</italic>, and <italic>DHH1</italic> also resulted in down-regulation of hundreds of specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast to the up-regulated transcripts, the vast majority of the down-regulated transcripts are not direct targets of Pat1, Lsm1, or Dhh1 and their down-regulation is thus likely to result from an indirect consequence of losing the primary functions of these factors in mRNA decapping. Two subgroups of transcripts that are indirectly controlled by the activities of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 were identified. One subgroup (Down-o-d) includes transcripts that were down-regulated only in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells and the other subgroup (Down-a-pld) includes transcripts that were down-regulated in all three deletion strains. The transcripts from these two subgroups exhibited concordant down-regulation in yeast cells partially compromised in, or completely lacking, decapping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>-F). Collectively, these observations indicate that transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups are sensitive to loss of both the regulatory and catalytic activities of mRNA decapping and argue that they are indirectly controlled by the status of general decapping activity in yeast cells.</p>
<p>Unlike the transcripts targeted directly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1, transcripts controlled indirectly by these factors are translated efficiently. Transcripts from the Down-o-d and Down-a-pld subgroups generally have higher average codon optimality scores, lower ribosomal occupancy, and higher protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These observations suggest that the susceptibility of these transcripts to the loss of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 functions is likely to be dictated by their unique properties in translation. The Down-o-d subgroup contains a small set of NMD substrates (Figure7C) and the decreased accumulation of these NMD-regulated transcripts in <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; cells largely results from more efficient decapping by an NMD-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right panel). Because Dhh1 forms several distinct complexes with the decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tritschler et al., 2009</xref>), more efficient decapping of NMD substrates in the absence of Dhh1 is likely caused by increases in the free pool of the decapping enzyme available for NMD as a consequence of <italic>DHH1</italic> deletion. The majority of transcripts controlled indirectly by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 are not typical decapping substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The decreased accumulation of these transcripts in the absence of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 probably results from more efficient 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; degradation. One possibility is that these transcripts are normally protected by an unknown factor at their 3&#x2019;-ends. Inactivation of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 leads to the stabilization of a significant number of transcripts. The stabilized transcripts might sequester the unknown factor from their normal binding substrates and make the latter susceptible to 3&#x2019; to 5&#x2019; decay. An interesting implication of these observations is that deletion of the genes encoding regulators of other steps in the gene expression pathway may lead to similar indirect and opportunistic effects.</p>

<sec id="s3d"><title>Reassessing the major functions of decapping activators</title>
<p>Current models of mRNA decapping propose two major temporally separated functions for decapping activators, an initial repression of mRNA translation followed by stimulation of the activity of the decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Parker, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Thus, for example, Dhh1 is thought to function principally in repressing translation, Edc3 is thought to activate the decapping enzyme, and Pat1 is thought to possess both activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). It is also generally believed that decapping of individual mRNAs requires the functions of multiple decapping activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Our results from <italic>in vivo</italic> expression profiling experiments presented here, and genetic analyses published earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">He and Jacobson, 2015a</xref>), challenge these views with data indicating that: a) the main function of decapping activators is to provide substrate specificity, i.e., to target the decapping enzyme to specific mRNAs; b) individual decapping activators target highly specific subsets of yeast transcripts and generally do not have overlapping regulatory activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); and c) the decapping enzyme is subject to negative regulation and its activation is most likely coupled to substrate recognition. These principles are not dependent on translational repression, and accumulating experimental evidence indicates that prior translational repression may not be required for decapping to occur. Decapping of individual mRNAs occurs while they are still engaged in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) and this co-translational decay appears to be widespread, both in genome-wide analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>) and in our experiments evaluating the transcripts targeted by Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, decapping activators may not have primary roles in regulating mRNA translation, but instead may function by monitoring mRNA translation initiation, elongation, or termination to target unique features of individual mRNAs.</p>

<p>Cells were all grown in YEPD media at 30&#x00B0;C. In each case, cells (15 ml) were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7 and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and then stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until RNA isolation.

<p>Procedures for RNA-Seq library construction were as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, total RNA was treated with Baseline-zero DNase (Epicenter) to remove any genomic DNA contamination. Five micrograms of DNase-treated total RNA was then depleted of rRNAs using the Illumina yeast RiboZero Removal Kit and the resulting RNA was used for RNA-Seq library preparation. Multiplex strand-specific cDNA libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit. Three independent cDNA libraries were prepared for each yeast strain analyzed.

<sec id="s4d1a"><label>i)</label><title>General computational methods</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were carried out using the R statistical programming environment, versions 3.3.2 and 3.3.4. R packages ggplot2, gplots, plyr, reshape2, and gridExtra were used for data pre-processing and visualization. Biostrings, BiocParallel, doSnow, and doParallel were used for parallel processing. Statistical tests were performed using built-in functions in base R distributions. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidian distances between libraries and transcripts with complete linkage. Non-finite (division by 0) and undefined (0 divided by 0) values were removed prior to clustering. The heights of the clustering tree branches indicate distance between two libraries. We used Fisher&#x2019;s exact test to assess different subsets of transcripts for either enrichment or depletion of a particular group of transcripts. We used external data (codon protection index, codon optimality, and protein abundance) as presented by the respective authors without any further refinement. Transcripts that were not included in these datasets were discarded prior to statistical testing.</p>

<sec id="s4d1b"><label>ii)</label><title>Analysis of differential mRNA expression</title>
<p>Transcripts differentially expressed in each of the mutant strains relative to the corresponding wild-type strain were identified using bioinformatics pipelines described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> R64-2-1 S288C reference genome assembly (sacCer3) was used to construct a yeast transcriptome comprised of 7473 transcripts. This transcriptome includes all annotated protein-coding sequences, functional and non-coding RNAs, and the unspliced isoforms of all intron-containing genes, but excludes all of the autonomous replicating sequences and long terminal repeats of transposable elements. The RSEM program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) was used to map sequence reads to the transcriptome and to quantify the levels of individual mRNAs with settings --bowtie-m 30 --no-bam-output --forward-prob 0. The expected read counts for individual mRNAs from RSEM were considered as the number of reads mapped to each transcript and were then imported into the Bioconductor DESeq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) for differential expression analysis. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used for multiple testing corrections. To account for replicate variability, we used a false discovery threshold of 0.01 (1&#x0025;) instead of an arbitrary fold change cutoff as the criterion for differential expression.</p>

<sec id="s4d1c"><label>iii)</label><title>Analysis of potential mechanisms of mRNA decay</title>
<p>Our expression analysis identified the transcripts regulated by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. To assess the potential decay mechanisms for the respective sets of transcripts, we analyzed the expression patterns of these mRNAs in mutant cells deficient in decapping or 5&#x2019; to 3&#x2019; exoribonuclease activities. In addition, to assess the degree of co-translational decay, we also analyzed the codon protection indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>) of these mRNAs in wild-type yeast cells under normal growth coditions. In our analyses, transcripts regulated by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 could be divided into six different subgroups. The up-regulated transcripts were grouped into Up-o-d, Up-o-pl, and Up-a-pld and the down-regulated transcripts were grouped into Down-o-d, Down-o-pl, and Down-a-pld subgroups (see Results). Boxplots were used to examine the distribution and the median value of both the relative levels and the codon protection indices for transcripts from each of these six subgroups The relative levels of individual mRNAs in mutant cells were determined by comparison to their levels in wild-type cells. The expression data for <italic>dcp1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>dcp2</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>xrn1</italic>&#x0394; cells were from our previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). Codon protection indices for individual mRNAs were generated by Pelechano and collegues based on their data from 5&#x2019;P sequencing of yeast decay intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). In their study, the codon protection index of a specific transcript is defined as the ratio of sequencing reads in the ribosome protected frame over the average reads of the non-protected frames. Codon protection index values greater than 1 are indicative of co-translational decay.</p>

<sec id="s4d1d"><label>iv)</label><title>Analysis of intrinsic properties associated with mRNA translation</title>
<p>To assess the potential links between translation and the functions of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 in mRNA decay, we examined several intrinsic properties associated with mRNA translation for transcripts regulated by these three factors. We analyzed the pattern and distribution of the average codon optimality score, the average ribosome density, and the estimated protein abundance for transcripts from the six subgroups of mRNAs controlled by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1. In our analysis, the average codon optimality score of individual mRNAs was calculated based on the optimal or non-optimal codon scores defined by Pechmann and Frydman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pechmann and Frydman, 2013</xref>). The average ribosome density of individual mRNAs was derived from published ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq data from wild-type yeast cells grown under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Young et al., 2015</xref>) and was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Celik et al. 2017</xref>). In brief, rawfastq files were downloaded and sequence reads were trimmed for adapter sequences using cutadapt with settings -a CTGTAGGCA -q 10 --trim-n -m 10. After adapter trimming, sequence reads were mapped to the transcriptome using bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) with settings -m4 -n 2 -l 15 --suppress 1,6,7,8 --best &#x2013;strata. After bowtie alignment, the riboSeqR (Chung et al.,2015) was used for preliminary visualizations and frame calling. For our ribosome occupancy calculations, we selected read lenghts that showed a strong preference (&#x003E;80&#x0025;) to a specific reading frame. After this filtering, the ribosome occupancy of individual mRNAs was calculated as coverage_ribo/coverage_rna, yielding a single value of ribosome occupancy for each mRNAs. We used these values to compare the translation efficiency of transcripts from different subgroups of mRNAs that are differentially expressed in <italic>pat1</italic>&#x0394;, <italic>lsm1</italic>&#x0394;, and <italic>dhh1</italic>&#x0394; strains. We excluded transcripts that had no RNA-Seq reads mapping to their ORFs in our analysis. Protein abundance levels came directly from the curated PaxDb (Protein Abundances Across Organisms) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and are the scaled aggregated estimates over several proteomic data sets.</p>
