<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is a soil bacterium capable of differentiating into a spore form resistant to desiccation, UV radiation, and heat. Early in spore development the cell possesses two copies of a circular chromosome, anchored to opposite cell poles via DNA proximal to the origin of replication (<italic>oriC</italic>). As sporulation progresses an FtsZ ring (Z-ring) assembles close to one pole and directs septation over one chromosome. The polar division generates two cell compartments with differing chromosomal contents. The smaller &#x201C;forespore&#x201D; compartment initially contains only 25&#x2013;30&#x0025; of one chromosome and this transient genetic asymmetry is required for differentiation. At the population level, the timely assembly of polar Z-rings and the precise capture of the chromosome in the forespore both require RefZ, a DNA-binding protein synthesized early in sporulation. To mediate precise capture of the chromosome RefZ must bind to specific DNA motifs (<italic>RBMs</italic>) that are localized near the poles around the time of septation, suggesting RefZ binds to the <italic>RBMs</italic> to affect positioning of the septum relative to the chromosome. RefZ&#x2019;s mechanism of action is unknown, however, cells artificially induced to express RefZ during vegetative growth cannot assemble Z-rings or divide, leading to the hypothesis that RefZ-RBM complexes mediate precise chromosome capture by modulating FtsZ function. To investigate this possibility, we isolated 10 RefZ loss-of-function (rLOF) variants unable to inhibit cell division when expressed during vegetative growth, yet were still capable of binding <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA. Sporulating cells expressing the rLOF variants in place of wild-type RefZ phenocopy a &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant, suggesting that RefZ mediates chromosome capture through an FtsZ-dependent mechanism. To better understand the molecular basis of RefZ&#x2019;s activity, the crystal structure of RefZ was solved and wild-type RefZ and the rLOF variants were further characterized. Our data suggest that RefZ&#x2019;s oligomerization state and specificity for the <italic>RBMs</italic> are critical determinants influencing RefZ&#x2019;s ability to affect FtsZ dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that RBM-bound RefZ complexes function as a developmentally regulated nucleoid occlusion system for fine-tuning the position of the septum relative to the chromosome during sporulation.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>B. subtilis</italic> can differentiate into a dormant cell type called a spore. Early in sporulation the cell divides near one pole, generating two compartments: a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore (future spore). Only approximately 30 percent of one chromosome is initially captured in the forespore compartment at the time of division and this genetic asymmetry is critical for sporulation to progress. Precise chromosome capture requires RefZ, a sporulation protein that binds to specific DNA motifs (<italic>RBMs</italic>) positioned at the pole near the site of cell division. How RefZ functions at the molecular level is not fully understood. Here we show that RefZ-<italic>RBM</italic> complexes facilitate chromosome capture by acting through the major cell division protein FtsZ.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To spatially regulate cellular processes, some macromolecules within the cell must assume a hetereogeneous distribution. One way that bacteria create heterogeneity along the bacterial envelope is to utilize proteins that induce and/or partition to sites of membrane curvature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. From there, membrane curvature proteins can serve as platforms for the localization of additional molecules in the cell. For example, in the rod-shaped bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the negative membrane curvature-sensing protein DivIVA coalesces adjacent to past and future cell division sites where it then recruits a cell division regulatory system called Min to inhibit FtsZ polymerization at non-medial sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Another commonly employed mechanism to restrict physiological processes to specific regions of a cell is to require that molecules assemble into larger, multi-subunit complexes to be active. For example, cell division, which requires the coordinated synthesis and turnover of all layers of the cell envelope at midcell, is carried out by a localized multi-subunit complex comprised of over 30 proteins called the &#x201C;divisome&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Bacteria also elicit subcellular heterogeneity by harnessing intrinsic properties of macromolecules, such as diffusion rates, oligomerization potential, and affinity for other molecules in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The ParABS system utilized to segregate chromosomes in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> elegantly demonstrates how bacteria can exploit the intrinsic properties of molecules to achieve spatial regulation. In the ParABS system, proteinprotein and protein-DNA interactions, regulated ATP hydrolysis, and diffusion are harnessed to achieve a new-pole biased gradient of the non-specific DNA-binding ParA. ParB bound at a <italic>parS</italic> site adjacent to <italic>oriC</italic> is initially anchored at the old pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, once a new round of DNA replication is initiated, affinity of ParB for ParA drives the net movement of the newly formed ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complex (and the replicated <italic>oriC</italic>) toward the ParA-enriched new pole, thus facilitating chromosome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The ParABS system not only demonstrates how the intrinsic properties of molecules can underlie heterogeneity of macromolecules within the cell, but also exemplifies how the nucleoid itself can be utilized in spatial regulation. The nucleoid is highly organized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and many DNA-binding proteins restrict their associated functions to specific cellular addresses by binding to unique DNA motifs. For example, transcription factors only regulate transcription at the promoters they associate with. There are also examples of DNA-binding proteins that bind to specific motifs to regulate the initiation of DNA replication (Spo0J/Soj)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, mediate DNA repair and recombination (MutL, XerCD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and segregate chromosomes (ParAB, Spo0J/SMC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, some DNA-binding proteins simultaneously interact with the nucleoid and the cell envelope to perform functions in DNA replication (DnaA, SeqA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, chromosome organization (RacA, SMC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, DNA segregation (FtsK/SpolIIE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and regulation of cell division (Noc)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The most extensively studied example of a DNA-binding protein that uses the nucleoid to spatially restrict cell division is SlmA, a TetR family protein found in <italic>Escherichia coli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and several other Gammaproteobacteria including <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. E. coli</italic> SlmA binds to dozens of motifs (SBSs) distributed throughout the chromosome except in the terminus (<italic>ter</italic>) region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In a mechanism termed <underline>N</underline>ucleoid <underline>O</underline>cclusion (NO), SlmA-SBS complexes inhibit cell division locally by disrupting polymerization of FtsZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. By restricting SlmA activity to sites of SBS enrichment, <italic>E. coli</italic> effectively inhibits the formation of Z-rings over the bulk nucleoid while at the same time permitting Z-ring assembly in the midcell-localized <italic>ter</italic> region. In this way, SlmA utilizes the chromosome as a landmark to spatially regulate its FtsZ-inhibitory function.</p>
<p>In addition to NO, <italic>E. coli</italic> utilizes at least two other systems to ensure Z-rings only assemble at midcell, between replicated chromosomes. The Min system, alluded to above for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, inhibits FtsZ polymerization in nucleoid-free regions near the poles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. More recently, ZapA, ZapB, and the DNA-binding protein MatP were shown to act in the <italic>ter</italic>-proximal region to promote midcell Z-ring formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Given that reproduction requires the faithful inheritance of intact genomes by progeny, it is not surprising that multiple mechanisms have evolved to ensure chromosomes are faithfully partitioned at the time of cell division.</p>
<p>Like <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> also possesses a NO system to prevent cell division over the bulk nucleoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The NO system of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is comprised of a DNA-binding protein, Noc, and its cognate binding sites (NBSs), which are also distributed throughout the chromosome except with a notable gap in the <italic>ter</italic> region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In contrast to SlmA, evidence for a direct interaction between Noc and FtsZ is currently lacking. Instead, Noc-NBS complexes associate with the cell envelope, where they are hypothesized to perturb the association and/or nucleation of FtsZ filaments at the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Establishing and maintaining subcellular organization is important, but cells must also be poised to dynamically reconfigure their overall organization in response to changing growth contexts. For example, during <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation, several major morphological changes must occur to facilitate spore formation. The cell&#x2019;s two chromosomes are stretched from pole to pole in an elongated <italic>oriC-ter-oriC</italic> configuration called the axial filament<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In addition, there is a dramatic adjustment in the location of cell division. FtsZ shifts from midcell toward a cell quarter and directs septation over one chromosome. During sporulation, Z-ring inhibition imposed by both the Min and NO systems at the cell pole must be relieved. Alleviation of Min inhibition may be facilitated by the repositioning of MinD (required to mediate MinC-dependent inhibition of FtsZ) to the distal cell pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Regarding NO, it has been proposed that the axial filament may be arranged such that relatively few Noc-binding sites are positioned at the site of incipient septation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The shift of FtsZ from midcell toward the pole is promoted by increased levels of FtsZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and expression of a membrane-associated sporulation protein, SpoIIE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Following septation, the larger mother cell possesses an entire chromosome, whereas the forespore initially contains only one-quarter to one-third of the second chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The genetic asymmetry between the mother cell and forespore is critical for differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and the region captured is reproducible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The chromosome is not bisected during polar division because SpoIIIE, a DNA translocase localized to the edge of the septum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, assembles around the chromosomal arms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Since the chromosome is threaded through the septum, SpoIIIE must directionally pump the remainder from the mother cell into the forespore for development to progress. To avoid chromosome breakage during septation, capture a reproducible region of DNA in the forespore, and pump the forespore-destined chromosome in the correct direction, there must be coordination between cell division proteins, SpoIIIE, and the chromosome. How this coordination is orchestrated at the molecular level largely remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Precise division over and capture of the forespore-destined chromosome requires RefZ, a TetR family DNA-binding protein conserved across the <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. RefZ expression is activated early in sporulation, first via the stationary phase sigma factor, <italic>&#x03C3;</italic>H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and then by Spo0A&#x007E;P, the activated form of the sporulation master response regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. RefZ binds to five nearly palindromic DNA motifs (RBMs), two on each chromosomal arm and one near <italic>oriC</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The <italic>RBMs</italic> on the left and right arms delineate the boundary between chromosomal regions present in the forespore and mother cell at the time of septation. Chromosomal regions immediately adjacent to each <italic>RBM</italic> localize near the incipient site of polar cell division, suggesting a possible role in division or organization of the chromosome near the sporulation septum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Consistent with this idea, the <italic>RBMs</italic> are required for precise capture of the forespore-destined chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Strikingly, the relative position of the <italic>RBMs</italic> with respect to <italic>oriC</italic> is conserved across the entire <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus. This evolutionary conservation strongly suggests that the location of the <italic>RBMs</italic> is functionally important and provides a considerable selective advantage to the genus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to imprecise chromosome capture, perturbation of RefZ activity is associated with two other phenotypes: first, during sporulation a &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant is modestly delayed in assembly of polar Z-rings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Second, artificially induced expression of RefZ during vegetative growth disrupts Z-ring assembly and inhibits cell division. RefZ-DNA complexes are likely required to disrupt Z-rings, as RefZ DNA-binding mutants no longer disrupt cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. These data, and the fact that RefZ and SlmA are both TetR family proteins led us to hypothesize that <italic>RBM</italic>-bound RefZ complexes might act as a developmentally regulated NO system that tunes FtsZ dynamics and/or Z-ring positioning relative to the chromosome.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we isolated and characterized 10 RefZ loss-of-function (rLOF) variants unable to inhibit cell division when misexpressed during vegetative growth, yet still capable of binding <italic>RBMs</italic>. None of the rLOF variants were able to support wild-type chromosome capture when expressed from the native promoter during sporulation, and instead phenocopied a &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant. These results are consistent with a model in which RefZ mediates precise chromosome capture by modulating FtsZ activity. To better understand the molecular basis of RefZ&#x2019;s activity, wild-type RefZ and the rLOF variants were overexpressed, purified, and structural and biochemical characterizations were carried out. The location of the rLOF substitutions on the RefZ crystal structure suggests that RefZ affects FtsZ through a mechanism that is distinct from that described for SlmA. Characterization of the rLOF variants indicates that specificity for <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA and RefZ&#x2019;s propensity to dimerize are critical determinants in governing RefZ&#x2019;s effect on cell division and precise capture of forespore chromosome <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Identification of RefZ residues important for inhibition of cell division</title>
<p>Misexpression of RefZ during vegetative growth disrupts Z-ring formation and inhibits cell division, resulting in filamentation. The division inhibition phenotype can be suppressed in strain backgrounds harboring specific mutations in <italic>ftsZ</italic> or a second copy of the <italic>ftsAZ</italic> operon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Division inhibition appears to require RefZ&#x2019;s DNA binding activity, as RefZ variants harboring substitutions in the DNA recognition helix (Y43A and Y44A) do not filament cells following misexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. DNA binding is also likely required for RefZ&#x2019;s role in chromosome capture, as a strain harboring point mutations in the five <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal RefZ binding motifs (<italic>RBM<sub>5mu</sub></italic>) exhibits the same capture defect as a &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Based on these data, we hypothesized that RefZ associates with <italic>RBMs</italic> to modulate FtsZ dynamics in the vicinity of the incipient septum and that this modulation would be required for ensuring precise chromosome capture.</p>
<p>To test whether RefZ&#x2019;s ability to inhibit cell division is required to support precise chromosome capture, we designed a two-stage genetic selection-screen to isolate RefZ loss-of-function (rLOF) variants capable of binding to the <italic>RBMs</italic>, but unable to disrupt cell division upon misexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). Gibson assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> was used to generate a library of linear misexpression constructs comprised of an IPTG-inducible promoter (P<sub><italic>hy</italic></sub>), randomly mutagenized <italic>refZ</italic> sequences (<italic>refZ</italic>&#x002A;), a selectable marker (<italic>spec<sup>R</sup></italic>) and regions of homology to direct double crossover integration of the linear DNA at a nonessential locus (<italic>amyE</italic>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). To select for rLOF mutants, we took advantage of the fact that in a sensitized background (&#x0394;<italic>minD</italic>), expression of wild-type <italic>refZ</italic> from an IPTG-inducible promoter prevents colony formation on solid medium, whereas expression of RefZ variants unable to inhibit cell division survive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In addition to <italic>minD</italic>, the native <italic>refZ</italic> gene was also deleted to ensure that the only RefZ expressed would be from the inducible promoter.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of rLOF variants</title><p>(A) Schematic of genetic selection (left) and screen (right) used to isolate rLOF variants that retain RBM-binding activity. The open-reading frame of <italic>refZ</italic> was mutagenized by error-prone PCR (<italic>refZ</italic>&#x002A;), placed under an IPTG-inducible promoter (P<sub><italic>hy</italic></sub>), and introduced at the <italic>amyE</italic> locus of competent recipient cells (BAM168). Mutations that interfere with RefZ&#x2019;s division inhibition function (P<sub><italic>hy</italic></sub>-<italic>rLOF</italic>) permit growth in the presence of IPTG. Survivors were screened for <italic>RBM</italic> binding (P<sub><italic>spremo</italic></sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic>) on plates containing X-gal and IPTG. (B) Ten unique rLOF variants that do not kill following induction but retain RBM-binding function were identified in the selection-screen. (C) The rLOF misexpression constructs were introduced into a wild-type (<italic>Bs168</italic>) genetic background and the extent of cell filamentation in CH medium following 90 min of induction with 1 mM IPTG was monitored using epifluorescence microscopy. Membranes were stained with TMA (white). The uninduced wild-type (WT) control is labeled in yellow. (D) Western blot analysis to monitor the production and stability of wild-type RefZ (WT) and the rLOF variants following 45 min of induction with 1 mM IPTG. RefZ is not produced at levels detectable above background with our antibody during vegetative growth (Lane 1, uninduced) or sporulation (data not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="459685_fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>To eliminate variants unable to bind DNA, survivors of the selection were screened for RBM-binding activity using a RefZ-repressible, <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion (P<italic><sub>spremo</sub>-lacZ</italic>) integrated at the non-essential sacA locus. P<sub><italic>spremo</italic></sub> harbors a single <italic>RBM</italic> (<italic>RBM<sub>L2</sub></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> inserted between the &#x2212;35 and &#x2212;10 elements of a constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). In this background, rLOF variants that can bind the engineered <italic>RBM</italic> operator repress <italic>lacZ</italic> expression and produce white colonies on media containing X-gal. In contrast, rLOF variants unable to bind the <italic>RBM</italic> due to decreased affinity for the <italic>RBM</italic>, poor expression, truncation, or misfolding produce blue colonies, allowing them to be excluded from further investigation.</p>
<p>To facilitate selection and screening efficiency and avoid cloning steps, transformation conditions were optimized so that the mutant <italic>refZ</italic> misexpression construct library could be directly introduced into the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chromosome (see Methods). RefZ loss-of-function and double-crossover integration were selected for simultaneously by plating transformations on a medium containing both spectinomycin and IPTG.</p>
<p>Approximately 1,300 viable transformants were obtained, 37 of which were either white or pale blue on medium containing X-gal and IPTG, consistent with rLOF repression of <italic>lacZ</italic> expression from the engineered <italic>RBM</italic> operator. Since resistance to RefZ can also be conferred by spontaneous suppressor mutations in <italic>ftsZ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, the 37 misexpression constructs were transformed into a clean selection-screen background, and survival and RBM-binding were reassessed. Four candidates failed to survive on IPTG plates, suggesting the presence of suppressor mutations in the original strains, while an additional four turned blue on X-gal indicator medium.</p>
<p>To identify rLOF mutations in the remaining 29 candidates, the P<sub><italic>hy</italic></sub>-<italic>rLOF</italic> region was amplified from the genomic DNA and sequenced. Ten unique single-point mutations were identified, corresponding to the 10 rLOF substitutions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. In contrast to wild-type RefZ, misexpression of the rLOF variants did not result in cell filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>), consistent with a loss of ability to affect FtsZ. The inability of rLOF variants to inhibit cell division was not anticipated to be attributable to protein misfolding or insufficient expression, as each variant was able to repress <italic>lacZ</italic> expression from the <italic>RBM</italic> operator in the primary screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). Consistent with this conclusion, Western blot analysis of the rLOF variants demonstrated that they are stably expressed and present at levels comparable to wild-type RefZ following misexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). From these data we conclude that the 10 rLOF variants are perturbed in their ability to affect FtsZ function, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<title>rLOF mutants miscapture the forespore chromosome</title>
<p>A &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant and a strain harboring point mutations in all five ori&#x2019;C-proximal <italic>RBMs</italic> (<italic>RBM<sub>5mu</sub></italic>) both exhibit a 2-fold increase in the frequency of left and right arm reporter capture compared to wild-type controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that if RefZ&#x2019;s ability to perturb FtsZ assembly is required to mediate precise chromosome capture, then the rLOF mutants would phenocopy the &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant with regard to chromosome trapping. To test this hypothesis, chromosome organization was monitored in sporulating cells expressing the rLOF variants from the native locus (native promoter) using a fluorescence-based trapping assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.

All of the rLOF mutations resulted in significant increases in both left and right arm reporter capture compared to wild-type controls (P&#x003C;0.05)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). Moreover, with the exception of right arm capture in the R116S mutant, miscapture of both left and right arm reporters in the rLOF mutants was statistically indistinguishable from the &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> controls (P&#x003E;0.05). The right arm reporter in the R116S mutant exhibited an intermediate capture defect that was statistically different from both &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> (P&#x003D;3.9&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) and wild-type (P&#x003D;2.3&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>). The intermediate capture defect observed in the R116S mutant suggests this variant retains some functionality, and is consistent with the reduced growth we observed on selection medium in the sensitized &#x0394;<italic>minD</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the same residues required for RefZ&#x2019;s ability to inhibit division upon misexpression are also required for precise chromosome capture, and are consistent with a model in which <italic>RBM</italic>-bound RefZ modulates FtsZ activity to position the polar septum relative to the chromosome.</p>

<title>Structural characterization of RefZ</title>
<p>Like the <italic>E. coli</italic> NO protein, SlmA, RefZ belongs to the TetR family of DNA-binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. At the sequence level, RefZ and SlmA share no significant similarity. We reasoned that structural characterization of RefZ and mapping of the rLOF substitutions to the RefZ structure would not only provide insight into how RefZ functions, but also allow for comparison to what is known about SlmA&#x2019;s mechanism of FtsZ inhibition. RefZ-His6 was purified, crystallized, and the structure was solved using singlewavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing at a resolution of 2.6 &#x212B;. RefZ crystallized as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit of a P4<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 crystal lattice. The model for residues 1-200 was built and refined with R<sub>work</sub>&#x003D; 22&#x0025; and R<sub>free</sub>&#x003D; 25&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each RefZ subunit is composed of 10 &#x03B1;-helices connected by loops and turns, with &#x03B1;1, &#x03B1;2, and &#x03B1;3 comprising the DNA binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain and &#x03B1;4-&#x03B1;10 comprising the regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>), similar to other structurally characterized TetR family proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. There are two major regions for dimerization contacts. Helices &#x03B1;7, &#x03B1;8, &#x03B1;9, and &#x03B1;10 form regulatory domain contacts with &#x03B1;7&#x2019;, &#x03B1;8&#x2019;, &#x03B1;9&#x2019;, and &#x03B1;10&#x2019;, with &#x03B1;8, &#x03B1;10, &#x03B1;8&#x2019; and &#x03B1;10&#x2019; forming a four-helix dimerization motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). A second interface is formed by &#x03B1;6 and &#x03B1;6&#x2019;, at the junction between the regulatory and DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). Although the crystallization condition included <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA, we observed no DNA in the crystal structure. In fact, the HTH DNA binding domain is involved in extensive crystal packing interactions, likely precluding DNA binding within the crystal lattice.</p>

<p>According to a structural similarity search using VAST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, RefZ shares the highest homology with PfmR from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (PDB: 3VPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, with a VAST similarity score of 15.4, closely followed by KstR2 of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (PDB: 4W97)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, with a score 15.2. The SlmA structure (PDB: 4GCT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> was the tenth closest in similarity with a score of 13.6. Superposition of SlmA and RefZ produced a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) in C&#x03B1; of 2.8.</p>
<p>RefZ&#x2019;s HTH domain (residues 1-45) has the highest contiguous alignment similarity score with QacR from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (PDB: 1JT6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, with a VAST similarity score of 4.0 and a rmsd value of 0.7. Superimposition of the HTH domains demonstrates the structures align closely (S1A Fig). However, when the RefZ dimer is superimposed with DNA-bound QacR (PDB: 1JT0), it is apparent that the RefZ dimer would need to undergo a conformational change for the &#x03B1;3 and &#x03B1;3&#x2019; helices to be accommodated in adjacent DNA major grooves (S1B Fig and S1C Fig).</p>
<p>DNA binding in TetR family proteins can be allosterically regulated by ligand binding in a pocket formed by &#x03B1;5, &#x03B1;6, and &#x03B1;7. For QacR, ligand binding results in a pendulum motion of &#x03B1;4 that repositions the HTH domains such that the distance between &#x03B1;3 and &#x03B1;3&#x2019; becomes incompatible with DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In the RefZ structure (unbound from DNA), there is no obvious ligand binding pocket in the &#x03B1;5-&#x03B1;7 regulatory region, suggesting RefZ&#x2019;s affinity to DNA is unlikely to be regulated by ligand binding in this region. At the same time, we do not exclude the possibility that a pocket may exist when RefZ is bound to DNA.</p>

<title>Characterization of RefZ and rLOF variant DNA-binding</title>
<p>RefZ&#x2019;s ability to inhibit cell division is dependent upon DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We predicted that the rLOF variants would be DNA-binding proficient because each was able to repress <italic>lacZ</italic> expression from an <italic>RBM</italic> operator in the <italic>in vivo</italic> screening assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>); however, RBM-binding in the <italic>in vivo</italic> assay was qualitative and not designed to differentiate between specific and non-specific DNA interactions. To directly examine the behavior of the variants with DNA, we overexpressed and purified each of the rLOF variants (S2 Fig) and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with wild-type and mutant <italic>RBM</italic> DNA probes as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Incubation of wild-type RefZ with a 150 bp <italic>RBM</italic>-containing probe produced two major mobility shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), corresponding to RefZ binding to <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA in units of two and four. Consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, the upshifts were lost when RefZ was incubated with a mutant <italic>RBM</italic> probe (harboring seven point-mutations in the central palindrome) suggesting that DNA binding is shows specificity for the <italic>RBM</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). Four of the rLOF variants (R116S, R116W, E117D, and E179K) produced specific upshifts similar to wild-type RefZ, suggesting that their loss-of-function phenotypes are not attributable to altered affinity or non-specific DNA binding.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Interaction of the rLOF variants with DNA.</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with 150 bp DNA probes (10 nM) centered on either the wild-type (lanes 1-4) or the mutant (lane 5&#x002A;) <italic>RBM<sub>L1</sub></italic> sequence. Probes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of purified RefZ-His6 (WT) or rLOF-His6 variants for 30 min. Reactions were run on a 5&#x0025; TBE gel for 30 min at 150 V. The tabulated K<sub>d</sub> values of RefZ for an immobilized 41 bp <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA segment were determined using a bio-layer interferometry assay. All the variants possessed K<sub>d</sub> values within 2-fold of the wild-type K<sub>d</sub>. The differences in K<sub>d</sub> between wild-type RefZ and R116W, E117G, and L153R are significant (indicated by asterisks)(P&#x003D;0.05, P&#x003D;0.025, and P&#x003D;0.003, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="459685_fig6.tif"/></fig>
<p>The remaining variants exhibited altered DNA interactions with respect to either specificity and/or mobility shift pattern. Two variants (E53K and E61K) exhibited a laddering pattern, possibly due to additional subunits of RefZ binding nonspecifically along the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). These variants also shifted a mutant <italic>RBM</italic>, consistent with enhanced nonspecific binding. E53K and E61K may assume conformations more favorable for nonspecific DNA binding since the substitutions are located on &#x03B1;4, a helix important for modulating DNA interaction in response to ligand binding in other TetR family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Although the laddering behavior was most extensive with E53K and E61K mutants, wild-type RefZ is also observed to ladder slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). The laddering behavior is more apparent when the EMSA gels are run at a higher voltage (200 V vs. 150 V)(S3A Fig), likely because EMSAs are non-equilibrium assays and the faster run time reduces RefZ disassociation. E117G also produced laddering, albeit to a lesser extent than either E53K or E61K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). The remaining variants, R102C, R102S, and L153R, each possess substitutions in residues that make dimerization contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). R102C, R102S and L153R produced two major upshifts, but were unable to ladder on DNA even under EMSA conditions in which wild-type RefZ displayed some laddering (S3B Fig).</p>
<p>To determine if there were quantitative differences in DNA binding that might account for the loss-of-function phenotypes, we determined the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of wild-type RefZ and each of the rLOF mutants for a 41 bp segment of <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA using bio-layer interferometry. The <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA, which was 5&#x2019; biotinylated, was immobilized on a streptavidin sensor. The association and dissociation of wild-type RefZ (S3 Fig) and the rLOF variants was then assessed by monitoring the change in thickness of the bio-layer. All of the rLOF variants displayed K<sub>d</sub> values within 2-fold of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). The decreased K<sub>d</sub> for the L153R mutant was most significant (P&#x003C;0.01), consistent with the reduced apparent affinity for DNA observed by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). These results suggest that the <italic>in vivo</italic> chromosome capture defect observed in strains harboring rLOF mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>), with the possible exception of L153R, are unlikely attributable to markedly reduced affinity for DNA.</p>

A minor peak, corresponding to an aggregate or higher-order oligomer, was also observed (S4 Fig). All of the rLOF variants tested displayed elution profiles comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>). These data indicate that if RefZ forms dimers in the absence of DNA, then these dimers are not stable enough to be maintained during size-exclusion chromatography.</p>

<title>Bacterial two-hybrid analysis of RefZ self-interaction</title>
<p>Size-exclusion chromatography is known to disassociate weaker oligomers, including dimers of at least one TetR family protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, to further investigate if any of the rLOF substitutions altered RefZ&#x2019;s ability to form dimers, we performed bacterial 2-hybrid (B2H) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In the B2H assay, wild-type RefZ displayed a selfinteraction that was not observed in the negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). The self-interaction is unlikely to require <italic>RBM</italic> binding, as the B2H assay is performed in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that lacks native <italic>RBM</italic> motifs. Consistent with this observation, a DNA-binding deficient variant, Y43A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, displayed self-interaction similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). The B2H is most likely reporting on dimerization as the RefZ forms a homodimer in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). To explore this possibility further, we introduced a substitution at the dimerization interface predicted to disrupt hydrogen bonding between RefZ subunits. Substitution of an alanine at R106, an invariant residue in <italic>Bacillus refZ</italic> homologs that participates in two hydrogen bond contacts across the dimer interface (four bonds total)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>), resulted in the reduced self-interaction as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>B2H analysis of the 10 rLOF variants revealed three classes of self-interaction phenotypes: loss-of-interaction, gain-of-interaction, and wild-type interaction. Three rLOF variants, L153R, R102C, and R116W classed as loss-of-interaction. Like R106, R102 and L153 are located on the dimer interface. R102 contributes a total of two hydrogen bonds to RefZ dimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). Substitution of a cysteine at R102 would therefore be expected to reduce dimerization and this is consistent with the reduced self-interaction observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). The L153R substitution introduces a longer, positively charged side chain into a hydrophobic region of the RefZ dimer interface, and thus is also predicted to reduce dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). No self-interaction was observed for the L153R variant, consistent with the structural prediction. These data suggest that the loss-of-function phenotypes of R102C and L153R may be related to a reduced ability to dimerize.</p>
<p>Three variants, E53K, R116S, and E179K displayed enhanced self-interaction compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). E53K is positioned on &#x03B1;4, the helix connecting the regulatory domain (&#x03B1;4-&#x03B1;10) to the DNA-binding domain (&#x03B1;1-&#x03B1;3). In TetR and QacR, conformational changes caused by ligand binding to the regulatory domain are transmitted through &#x03B1;4 to the HTH, leading to DNA release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Since the E53K mutant also shows higher affinity for non-specific DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), we hypothesize that E53K facilitates a conformation that both dimerizes and binds DNA more readily. Given that the R116S and R116W variants display opposite phenotypes (enhanced and weakened self-interaction, respectively), R116 clearly has an important role in determining RefZ&#x2019;s dimerization state. The E179K substitution is located just proximal to &#x03B1;8, a helix that participates in hydrophobic interactions between RefZ subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). The E179K substitution may cause a change in RefZ&#x2019;s overall conformation that enhances hydrophobic interactions between helices &#x03B1;8 and &#x03B1;8&#x2019; of the RefZ subunits.</p>
<p>Four variants, R102S, E61K, E117D, and E117G, exhibited self-interaction comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). Notably, even though the R102S and E117D substitutions support wild-type self-interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>) and <italic>RBM</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), they are not functional <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results suggest that R102 and E117 are perturbed in functions not revealed by the <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays. At the same time, six of the 10 rLOF variants display either reduced or increased self-interaction, suggesting that the ability of RefZ to switch between monomer and dimer forms is likely important for the mechanism leading to FtsZ inhibition.</p>

<title>Thermostability of RefZ and the rLOF variants</title>
<p>To examine the effect of the rLOF substitutions on RefZ&#x2019;s thermostability, we performed differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). Wild-type RefZ displayed a single transition melting curve (S5 Fig, WT), with a melting temperature (Tm) of 39&#x00B0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>). With the exception of R116W, all of the variants displayed single transition melting curves (S5 Fig). Most of the variants exhibited a lower Tm compared to wild type (L153R&#x003C;R102C&#x003C;R116S&#x003C;R102S&#x003C;WT). Notably, L153R and R102C were the most destabilized (&#x2212;5&#x00B0;C and &#x2212;4&#x00B0;C, respectively) and also showed the weakest self-interaction in the B2H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). Conversely, E53K was more thermostable than wild type and also displayed the most self-interaction by B2H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>). R116W also displayed reduced thermostability and self-interaction; however, unlike L153R and R102C, the R116W melting curve displayed two transitions, suggesting that the R116W variant assumes more than one conformation in solution. These results suggest that RefZ and the rLOF variants may assume multiple conformations in solution, and that RefZ&#x2019;s oligomerization state may be partly reflected in the thermostability measurements.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RefZ is required for the timely redistribution of FtsZ from midcell to the pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. RefZ can also inhibit Z-ring assembly and filament cells when it is artificially induced during vegetative growth, an activity that requires DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Under its native regulation, RefZ is expressed early in sporulation and requires the <italic>RBMs</italic> to facilitate precise capture of the chromosome in the forespore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Together, these results suggest that RefZ&#x2019;s effect on FtsZ, whether direct or indirect, is regulated by interactions with the nucleoid. Strikingly, the <italic>RBMs</italic> and their relative positions on the chromosome with respect to <italic>oriC</italic> are conserved across the entire <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus, indicating there is strong selective pressure to maintain the location of the <italic>RBMs</italic>. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the <italic>RBMs</italic> are positioned in the cell near the site of polar septation. These observations, and the fact that RefZ, like SlmA (the NO protein of <italic>E. coli</italic>) belongs to the TetR family of DNA-binding proteins led us to hypothesize that RefZ binds to the <italic>RBMs</italic> to tune Z-ring positioning relative to the chromosome during sporulation.</p>
<p>To determine if RefZ&#x2019;s FtsZ-inhibitory activity was important for chromosome capture, we took advantage of RefZ&#x2019;s vegetative misexpression phenotype (filamentation and cell killing in a sensitized background) to isolate 10 rLOF variants capable of binding DNA, but unable to inhibit FtsZ. All 10 of the rLOF variants were unable to support correct chromosome capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>), consistent with a model in which RefZ-RBM complexes act through FtsZ to facilitate precise septum placement with respect to the chromosome during polar division. This model is also supported by recent evidence showing that on average, &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutants position Z-rings approximately 15&#x0025; further away from the cell pole compared to the wildtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>RefZ and SlmA do not inhibit FtsZ through a common mechanism</title>
<p>To better understand RefZ&#x2019;s mechanism of action at the molecular level, wildtype RefZ and the rLOF variants were overexpressed, purified, and analyzed using structural and biochemical approaches (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The RefZ crystal structure revealed that RefZ is capable of forming a homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>), similar to other TetR proteins, including SlmA. The relative locations and nature of the loss-of-function substitutions in RefZ and SlmA are different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that if RefZ interacts with FtsZ directly, then RefZ&#x2019;s mechanism of action is distinct from that of SlmA. At least some mechanistic differences would be expected, as the C-terminal tails of FtsZ from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> are distinct. More specifically, while the portion of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsZ observed to interact with SlmA in the co-crystal is relatively conserved (DIPAFLR in <italic>E. coli</italic> and DIPTFLR in <italic>B. subtilis)</italic>, the remainder of the C-termini differ significantly (KQAD in <italic>E. coli</italic> and NRNKRG in <italic>B. subtilis)</italic>.</p>

<title>The role of self-interaction and RBM-binding in RefZ function</title>
<p>An important finding of this study is that both enhanced and reduced RefZ dimerization are correlated with loss-of-function phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>. B2H analysis indicates that the majority of rLOF variants (6/10) exhibited either stronger or weaker self-interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>), suggesting that RefZ&#x2019;s propensity to switch between a monomer and dimer states is integral to affecting FtsZ function. Two rLOF variants (R102C and L153R) possess substitutions predicted to disrupt dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>), a result corroborated by B2H analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). L153R also causes a 2-fold reduction in affinity for <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA, which could affect its ability to appropriately localize to <italic>RBMs in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Two rLOF variants (E53K and E61K) are located on &#x03B1;4. Based on the observation that E53K and E61K exhibit enhanced laddering and an increased apparent affinity for nonspecific DNA by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), we propose that these variants assume a conformation that is more favorable for nonspecific DNA-binding than that assumed by wild type. <italic>In vivo</italic>, enhanced nonspecific binding would reduce the formation of RefZ-RBM complexes, which prior data suggest is the functional form of RefZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The ability of RefZ to generate DNA laddering in EMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref> and S3 Fig) is presumably due to the association of additional RefZ subunits to adjacent DNA after the initial pair of dimers binds the RBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Other TetR proteins, including SlmA, have also been observed to &#x201C;spread&#x201D; on DNA <italic>in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup></italic>. In the case of SlmA, spreading on DNA is hypothesized to facilitate interaction with the exposed C-terminal tails of FtsZ to promote filament breakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Although genetic and cell biological data suggest RefZ and FtsZ interact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, evidence for direct interaction between RefZ and FtsZ is lacking. Attempts to test for RefZ-FtsZ interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> have been impeded by RefZ&#x2019;s limited solubility outside of the specific conditions identified in this study. Therefore, the precise mechanism by which RefZ affects FtsZ remains to be determined.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting observations obtained from characterizing the rLOF variants is that the R116S and R116W substitutions on the first turn of &#x03B1;7 result in opposite self-interaction phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). Both variants behave comparably with regard to affinity and specificity for the <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>), suggesting the loss-of-function phenotypes are not attributable to differences in DNA interaction or protein misfolding. Instead, these results suggest that R116 is a key residue in determining the stability of the RefZ dimer. We hypothesize that R116 participates in intramolecular bonds with residues within a flexible loop region (between &#x03B1;6 and &#x03B1;7, residues 109-114)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>), possibly contributing to the formation of a more stable homodimer. R116 could participate in formation of either ionic or hydrogen bonds with a invariant aspartate residue (D111) located in the flexible loop. Our ability to assess R116&#x2019;s role in intramolecular bond formation is limited in the current crystal structure, as the electron density for the R116 side-chain is not well defined. Moreover, the electron density for the main chain of the flexible loop is moderately disordered, showing peaks of positive Fo-Fc electron density next to the I110 and D111 side-chains.</p>
<p>R116 is also immediately adjacent to E117, another critical residue identified in this study. E117D is the only rLOF variant that is loss of function with regard to inhibiting cell division and capturing the forespore chromosome, yet is not detectably altered in the other RefZ properties implicated in function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). If RefZ targets FtsZ directly, then these data point toward E117 as a likely candidate residue for mediating interaction. The E117D substitution is intriguing because the glutamate to aspartate change is highly conservative; however, if the interaction is direct, the shorter sidechain of the aspartate could compromise RefZ&#x2019;s ability to target FtsZ. It has not escaped our attention that many regulators of FtsZ including FtsA, ZapD, and MinD possess glutamate or aspartate residues near the implicated FtsZ C-terminal tail binding site which are proceeded by either a hydrophobic or polar uncharged residue followed by an arginine or lysine. For example, FtsA from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> possesses LRE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, ZapD from <italic>E. coli</italic> and a variety of Gammaproteobacteria I(R/K)E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, and MinD a highly conserved ARD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Whether these residues represent a <italic>bona fide</italic> motif involved in FtsZ regulation remains to be determined, but it is intriguing that two residues identified as critical for RefZ function fall within an IRE sequence.</p>

<title>Working model for RefZ-mediated septum positioning</title>
<p>Based on the data available, we propose a model in which RefZ mediates chromosome capture by fine-tuning the position of FtsZ assembly over the forespore-destined chromosome. In our model, RefZ is primed to inhibit FtsZ polymerization near the pole by binding specifically to the polarly-localized <italic>RBMs</italic>. Based on structural studies of other TetR family proteins and the observation that RefZ binds to <italic>RBMs</italic> in units of two and four <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, RefZ likely binds each <italic>RBM</italic> as a pair of dimers. We were not able to report RefZ copy number as native RefZ levels are too close to the detection limit of our antibodies; however, our preliminary data suggest that RefZ is likely a relatively low copy number protein.</p>
<p>Current data suggest the activity of RefZ inhibits rather than promotes FtsZ assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. This raises the question as to how an inhibitor of FtsZ could act near the pole to promote precise placement of a polar division apparatus. In our model, RefZ is a locally-acting inhibitor of FtsZ and its primary function is not to inhibit the formation of polar Z-rings altogether, but rather to tune the location of Z-ring assembly away from the immediate vicinity of the <italic>RBMs</italic>. Based on comparative analysis of the rLOF mutants, both decreased and increased ability to dimerize appears to be detrimental to the inhibitory function of RefZ. This implies that a dynamic process of monomer-dimer exchange, not maintaining a specific oligomeric state, is what is important for RefZ function. One possibility is that <italic>RBM</italic>-bound dimers disassociate from DNA as monomers after engaging with FtsZ.</p>
<p>We present no evidence that RefZ&#x2019;s DNA association or monomer-dimer exchange is influenced by a ligand, and no obvious ligand binding pocket is observed in the regulatory domain of the solved crystal structure. At the same time, we do not exclude the possibility that RefZ activity could be regulated through interaction with FtsZ or ligand binding. Recently EthR, an important TetR family protein from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that regulates drug resistance, was shown to bind the nucleotide cyclic-di-GMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Interestingly, EthR&#x2019;s proposed nucleotide binding region (based on mutagenesis and docking studies) is at the dimer interface, outside the canonical ligand binding pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> (near R102 in RefZ).</p>
<p>Another paradox raised is why a &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant exhibits a slight delay in shifting Z-rings from midcell to the pole during sporulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. If RefZ acts as an inhibitor at the pole, then assembly of the polar Z-ring would be expected to accelerate in a &#x0394;<italic>refZ</italic> mutant. This seeming contradiction may be explained by considering RefZ&#x2019;s localization during sporulation. At early timepoints, just before polar division occurs, RefZ-GFP localizes as foci near the poles. These foci likely represent RefZ-RBM complexes, as they are lost in a RefZ mutant that cannot bind DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Around the time polar division initiates, the polar RefZ foci become less apparent and RefZ is observed to coalesce near midcell at or near the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The redistribution of RefZ&#x2019;s inhibitory activity from the pole to midcell as sporulation progresses could facilitate disassembly of the midcell Z-ring and its reassembly at the pole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Preliminary data also suggest that RefZ has a second role, to prevent additional midcell divisions as sporulation progresses (Miller and Herman, unpublished), and current investigations are aimed at exploring this possibility.</p>

<p><bold>S1 Figure. Superimposition of the N-terminal domains of RefZ and QacR.</bold> (A) Superimposition of the HTH domains of RefZ (cyan) and QacR (orange)(PDB: 1JT6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The Y43 residue on &#x03B1;3 of RefZ, which is required for DNA binding and the corresponding residue in QacR (Y41) are shown as sticks. (B) Superimposition of RefZ dimer (cyan) with the QacR dimer (orange) bound to <italic>IR1</italic> DNa (white)(PDB: 1JT0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. (C) Superimposition of the HTH domains of RefZ (cyan) with QacR (orange) bound to <italic>IR1</italic> DNA (white)(PDB 1JT0).</p>
<p><bold>S2 Figure. Example purification profiles of wild-type RefZ and rLOF variants.</bold> The top gel was loaded with 5 &#x03BC;g protein/lane and stained with coomassie blue dye (R-250). Gels below show example elution profiles from Nickel-NTA agarose beads. The elution gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue dye (colloidal coomassie, G-250). G-250 is approximately 10 times more sensitive than R-250, allowing for detection of less abundant proteins.</p>
<p><bold>S3 Figure. EMSA laddering behavior of wild-type RefZ and rLOF variants.</bold> (A) Laddering of DNA in the EMSAs can be observed for wild-type RefZ and to a greater extent E53K when samples are resolved at 200 V on a 7.5&#x0025; TBE gel. (B)The rLOF variants R102C, R102S, and L153R do not exhibit laddering when samples are resolved at 200 V on a 7.5&#x0025; TBE gel. (C) Typical bio-layer interferometry binding curve for wildtype RefZ with <italic>RBM</italic>-containing DNA. Sensors are pre-equilibrated for 10 min in DNA binding buffer (150 mM KCl and 10 mM Tris [pH 8]) at room temperature (not shown). The experiment is then initiated and performed at 30&#x00B0;C to establish a 30 sec baseline. The streptavidin sensor is dipped into a solution of biotinylated dsDNA (a 41 bp segment centered on <italic>RBMli</italic>) for 2 min. After incubation a new baseline is established by returning the biosensor to the DNA-binding buffer for 30 sec. The biosensor is then moved to a well containing 800 nM protein for 3 min to monitor association. The sensor is then transferred to a well containing fresh DNA-binding buffer to monitor dissociation for 15 min.</p>
<p><bold>S4 Figure. Size-exclusion chromatogram for WT RefZ.</bold> An example Superdex 200 elution profile for 200 &#x03BC;l of 1 &#x03BC;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> RefZ-His6 (7.7 nmol) ran with 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 9], 300 mM KCl and 10&#x0025; (v/v) glycerol. Absorbance at 280 nm is shown on the Y-axis (mAU - milliabsorbance units). Aggregated RefZ elutes at 7.6 ml, near the column void volume (7.0 ml).</p>
<p><bold>S5 Figure. Thermostability of RefZ and the rLOF variants.</bold> DSF estimates of wildtype RefZ-His6 and rLOF-His6 variant stability reported by fluorescence of SYPRO orange as a function of increasing temperature. (A) Representative sigmoidal melting curves. (B) Tm values (inset) were calculated by determining the temperature at which the first derivative of the fluorescence is at a minimum. &#x0394;Tm (inset) is the difference between the wild-type RefZ and each rLOF variant. Differences less than 1.5&#x00B0;C were not considered to be significant and are shown as dashes.</p>
