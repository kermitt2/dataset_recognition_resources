<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Measles is a highly transmissible disease and is one of the leading causes of death among young children under 5 globally. While the use of ongoing surveillance data and &#x2013; recently &#x2013; dynamic models offer insight on measles dynamics, both suffer notable shortcomings when applied to measles outbreak prediction. In this paper, we apply the Sequential Monte Carlo approach of particle filtering, incorporating reported measles incidence for Saskatchewan during the pre-vaccination era, using an adaptation of a previously contributed measles compartmental model. To secure further insight, we also perform particle filtering on an age structured adaptation of the model in which the population is divided into two interacting age groups &#x2013; children and adults. The results indicate that, when used with a suitable dynamic model, particle filtering can offer high predictive capacity for measles dynamics and outbreak occurrence in a low vaccination context. We have investigated five particle filtering models in this project. Based on the most competitive model as evaluated by predictive accuracy, we have performed prediction and outbreak classification analysis. The prediction results demonstrated that this model could predict the measles transmission patterns and classify whether there will be an outbreak or not in the next month (Area under the ROC Curve of 0.89). We conclude that anticipating the outbreak dynamics of measles in low vaccination regions by applying particle filtering with simple measles transmission models, and incorporating time series of reported case counts, is a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in estimating risk and magnitude of measles outbreaks. Such approach offer particularly strong value proposition for other pathogens with little-known dynamics, critical latent drivers, and in the context of the growing number of high-velocity electronic data sources. Strong additional benefits are also likely to be realized from extending the application of this technique to highly vaccinated populations.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Measles is a highly infectious disease and is one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. In 2016, close to 90,000 people died from measles. Measles can cause outbreaks particularly in people who did not receive protective vaccine. Understanding how measles outbreaks unfold can help public health agencies to design intervention strategies to prevent and control this potentially deadly infection. Although traditional methods &#x2013; including the use of ongoing monitoring of infectious diseases trends by public health agencies and simulation of such trends using scientific technique of mathematical modeling &#x2013; offer insight on measles dynamics, both have shortcomings when applied to our ability to predict measles outbreaks. We seek to enhance the accuracy with which we can understand the current measles disease burden as well as number of individuals who may develop measles because of lack of protection and predict future measles trends. We do this by applying a machine learning technique that combines the best features of insights from ongoing observations and mathematical models while minimizing important weaknesses of each. Our results indicate that, coupled with a suitable mathematical model, this technique can predict future measles trends and measles outbreaks in areas with low vaccination coverage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, and has imposed a significant morbidity and mortality burden where vaccination coverage is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. About 30&#x0025; of all cases of measles have one or more complications including diarrhea, otitis media, pneumonia or encephalitis. Measles mortality was estimated to be 0.2&#x0025; in the United States between 1985 and 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Prior to widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In 2016, approximately 89,780 people died from measles &#x2013; mostly children under the age of 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The Americas has become the first region in the world to have eliminated measles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], however importation of cases from other regions leads to outbreaks in unimmunized and under-immunized populations. Understanding measles epidemic patterns can aid in forecasting and help public health agencies to design intervention strategies to prevent and control it, such as setting outbreak response measures, setting vaccination targets, and allocating financial and human resources, etc.</p>
<p>Traditionally, many public health agencies seek to anticipate future transmission of infectious diseases based upon time series of reported incident case counts, derived from public health surveillance. In recent years, simulation models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] have increasingly been used to predict the spread of measles within the population, and the potential impact of interventions on that spread. Although both these methods have their benefits, and have played an important role in estimating and predicting measles epidemic pattern, each suffers from notable limitations.</p>
<p>In many jurisdictions worldwide, measles is a notifiable illness under respective Public Health Acts, and surveillance reports are collected and examined on a regular basis. These data &#x2013; often summarized as epi-curves &#x2013; have offered great value for public health agencies seeking to understand trends in measles incidence and anticipate future evolution. For example, identifying and confirming suspected measles cases through surveillance allows early detection of outbreaks, and supports comparing recent activity to reference periods. However, the reported time series data are often quite noisy, particularly for contexts marked by smaller population or low incidence or diagnosis rates. Such reports are also delayed, and may be incomplete, since families of some of those infected elect not to seek care. When used unassisted, time series lack the capacity to provide quantitatively rigorous insight into the future evolution of the observed patterns -&#x2013; evolution that will be shaped by a complex combination of local circumstances, including birth rates, contact patterns, and the size of latent factors such as the local pool of susceptibles as affected by vaccination rates, immunity acquired after contracting disease and recent history of outbreaks. Perhaps most importantly when considered as a tool for planning, use of time series alone cannot itself be used to investigate counterfactuals, such as how an outbreak response immunization campaign, enhanced contact tracing, advisories, exclusions from schools, day care and workplaces or social distancing measures are likely to affect future incidence dynamics.</p>
<p>Dynamic modeling has played a significant role in providing insight to the measles outbreak dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Most such contributions employing models seek to incorporate some aspects of local epidemiology, &#x003C;and often draw on surveillance data. While powerful tool for investigating counterfactuals, such models also suffer from an essential set of shortcomings. Firstly, while dynamic models are commonly calibrated to empirical data, this process is typically undertaken on a one-time basis, and with significant human involvement. It is rare for a dynamic model to incorporate ongoing arriving ground data; and while systems doing so can be found for other infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], the authors are not aware of any such support for dynamic modeling of measles. More profoundly, a dynamic model of necessity represents a simplified characterization of processes in the real world. Inevitably, such models often omit, simplify and misestimate some factors. These drawbacks and the infeasibility of anticipating the realized outcome of factors represented as stochastic in the model will inevitably lead the model to diverge from ground truth data. While calibration can allow for estimation of model parameters, it provides weak support for ongoing estimation of latent state needed to keep the state of a model aligned with observations on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>This paper seeks to support more accurate estimation and prediction of measles dynamics by applying a computational statistics technique that combines the best features of insights from ongoing (although noisy) empirical data and dynamic models (although fraught by systematic errors, omissions, and stochastic divergence over time) while mitigating important weaknesses of each. The use of sequential Monte Carlo methods in the form of particle filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] has provided an effective and versatile approach to solving this problem in other infectious diseases, such as the influenza. Specifically, this paper investigates the combination of particle filtering methods with a compartmental model (SEIR model) of measles to recurrently estimate the latent state of the population with respect to the natural history of infection with measles, to anticipate measles evolution and outbreak transitions in pre-vaccination era.</p>

<title>Model characterization and discrepancy comparison</title>
<p>To research on the performance of incorporating particle filtering into the compartmental model, we have built 7 models, including 1 normal deterministic model, 1 calibration model and 5 particle filtering models. In the particle filtering models, the number of particles are all 5000. These models respectively listed as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Pure<sub>aggregate</sub></italic>. It is simply the deterministic SEIR model with aggregate population, see the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq (1)</xref>. The value of the initial infectious population is 90, the initial susceptible population is 89910, the initial exposure population is 0, and the initial recovered population is 773545. The values of <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> and reporting rate <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> are 50 and 0.11, respectively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Calibrated<sub>aggregate</sub></italic>. It is the calibration model of the SEIR model with aggregate population. However, the relatively uncertain and stochastic parameters, including initial infectious population, initial susceptible population, the parameter <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> and reporting rate <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> are obtained by calibration. Finally, they are relatively 930, 89070, 49.598 and 0.119. The initial exposure population is 0, and the initial recovered population is 773545.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>PF<sub>aggregate</sub></italic>. The particle filtering model with homogeneous mixing of all population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>PF<sub>age&#x005F;5&#x005F;monthly</sub></italic>. The age structure model where the child age group includes those less than 5 years old, and only incorporated with the monthly reported empirical data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>PF<sub>age_5&#x005F;both</sub></italic>. The age structure model where the child age group includes those less than 5 years old, and incorporated with both the monthly reported and yearly reported age group empirical data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>PF<sub>age&#x005F;15&#x005F;monthly</sub></italic>. The age structure model where the child age group includes those less than 15 years old, and only incorporated with the monthly reported empirical data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>PF<sub>age&#x005F;15&#x005F;both</sub></italic>. The age structure model where the child age group includes those less than 15 years old, and incorporated with both the monthly reported and yearly reported age group empirical data.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>By comparing the discrepancy of these models, we sought to identify the model offering the greatest predictive validity. We then used the most favorable model to perform prediction analysis. To assess model results, each of the five particle filtering models was run 5 times with random seeds generated from the same set. We then calculated the average and 95&#x0025; confidence intervals of the mean discrepancy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref> show the comparison of the discrepancy among the seven models. It is notable that the yearly discrepancy is not available for the aggregated population models. The results demonstrate that the particle filtering models strongly decrease the model discrepancy. This indicates that incorporating particle filtering in the compartmental model of measles could help to improve the simulation accuracy. Secondly, the results suggest that the age structure particle filtering models perform better (as measured by discrepancy) than the aggregated population model, because the monthly discrepancy of all the four stratified age group models are smaller than the aggregated population model. Thirdly, an appropriate splitting of the age groups is also important in improving the simulation results of the models. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref> indicate that the discrepancy of stratified age group models splitting the age group at age 15 years are all smaller than the models splitting the age group at age 5 years. Finally, results suggest that incorporating both the monthly empirical reported cases and yearly empirical data of each age group may be also helpful in improving the simulation accuracy of the models, but further realizations are required to confirm these results. The results suggest that the model <italic>PF<sub>age&#x005F;15&#x005F;both</sub></italic> offers the minimum discrepancy. It is notable that while aggregate population models cannot be compared directly against the other models in terms of total discrepancy, it suffers from the least favorable score in terms of the metric by which comparisons can be made (the monthly discrepancy).</p>

<title>Result Analysis of the minimal discrepancy model</title>
<p>To depict the particle filter results, 2D histograms of reported measles cases calculated by the model and empirical data were plotted. To let the 2D histogram plot characterize the model&#x2019;s output data with proper weighting in accordance with the principles of importance sampling, we plotted the results of the particles sampled by weights. The resulting plot thus represents an approximation to the probability distribution of reported measles cases characterized by the model. It is notable that the number of particles performed, the number of particles sampled in 2D histograms and the number of particles sampled (also by weight) in calculating the discrepancy in all the models in this paper are all 5000, except where otherwise noted.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref> display the prior and posterior results of the particle filtering model <italic>PF<sub>age&#x005F; 15&#x005F;both</sub></italic> for the entire timeframe, respectively. The results include the 2D histogram of monthly reported measles count and the 2D histogram of yearly reported count of each age group. It is notable that because the weights of particles are updated at each month, the 2D histogram plot giving the prior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> is not suitable for the yearly result. Values of empirical data points are shown in red. From them we can see that most of the empirical data are located at the range where the particles exhibit high posterior probability. This reflects the fact that the particles could suitably track the oscillation of the epidemic pattern of measles, given the combination of model prediction and observation-based updating that forms the basis for the particle filter.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="340661_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>It bears emphasis that the results of the particle filtering model sampled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> are before the weight update process in each step, while the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref> are after the weight update process in each step. The value of sampled particles of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref> spread in a wider range, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>. This difference in dispersion indicates that the weight update process of particle filtering algorithm in this paper has the capability to combine the empirical data to the particle filtering model to constrain the particles in a tighter range as suggested by the empirical data.</p>
<p>Particle filtering models can contribute to the estimation of model states and aid in estimating dynamic model parameters. It is notable that, as is widely the case in dynamic models, the states in the compartmental models are latent (e.g., Susceptible (S), Exposure (E), Infectious (I) and Recovered (R) stocks in the SEIR model <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs (1)</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">(5)</xref> of measles). What can be empirically observed is the noisy reported measles cases related to the Infectious (I) state. However, the methodology of particle filter provides an approach to estimate (via sampling from) the distribution of values of these latent states. This ability to estimate the value of latent states &#x2013; such as the reservoir of susceptible people &#x2013; can aid researchers and public health agencies to in terms of understanding the underlying epidemiological situation from multiple lines of evidence, as constrained by understanding of the structure of the system, as characterized by a dynamic model. To illustrate this, we employ a similar method to the above to plot the 2D histogram of the stocks of susceptible, infectious, exposure and recovered sampled according to importance sampling principles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref> show the results of the plots. These plots indicate that most of the susceptible, exposure and infectious people are located in the children (less than 15 years) age group, while most of the recovered population are located in the adults (equal and greater than 15 years) age group. This lies in accordance with the expectations for measles transmission in the real world and builds confidence in the capacity of the model to meaningfully estimate latent state. As noted below, estimation of latent state can be an important enabler for understanding of the effects of interventions.</p>

<p>These prediction results suggest that the particle filter model offers the capacity to probabilistically anticipate measles dynamics with a fair degree of accuracy. From the 2D histogram plots, empirical data lying after Prediction Start Time &#x2013; and thus not considered by the particle filtering machinery &#x2013; mostly lie within the high-density range of the particles. Notably, in such examples, the particle filter model appears to be able to accurately anticipate a high likelihood of a coming outbreak and non-outbreak. Such an ability could offers substantial value for informing the public health agencies with accurate predictions of the anticipated evolution of measles over coming months.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we present a new method for tracking the epidemic pattern of measles in low vaccination regions by applying particle filtering with simple measles transmission models, and incorporating noisy monitored data. Particle filtering offers many attractive features for epidemiological models. Firstly, it relaxes the stiff assumptions of normality with respect to the process and observation noise required by older statistical filtering techniques (such as Kalman Filtering); such assumptions are often particularly problematic in epidemiological contexts with small sample counts. Secondly, particle filtering is especially well suited to non-linear models such as that used here, because it foregoes focus on a single Maximum Likelihood Estimate seen in the Kalman Filter &#x2013; which can be particularly problematic in the context of state uncertainty that can span multiple basins of attraction &#x2013; and instead samples from a distribution of possible states for a given time-point. In our study, the particle filtering algorithm has mitigated significant weaknesses and simplifications associated with aggregate compartmental models and noisy empirical data. By incorporating ongoing arriving empirical data, the particle filter model has the capability to correct for distortions that accompany compartmental model aggregation, such as assumptions of random mixing and homogeneity. In this dataset, the particle filter offered strong performance in estimating the epidemic pattern of measles and predicting future trends.</p>
<p>Specifically, five particle filter models were investigated in this project. By comparing the results, the strongest predictive performance emerged from the age stratified model whose child age group is defined as including those up to 15 years old, and considering both monthly empirical data of total population and yearly reported cases of each age group. However, testing the models over additional realizations is required in order to validate these results. Finally, we perform prediction analysis based on this best model. The results suggest that particle filtering approaches offer notable strengths in predicting of occurrence of measles outbreak in the subsequent month.</p>
<p>A key benefit of particle filtering lies in its capacity to estimate the latent state of the system &#x2013; state that cannot be directly measured, but which is jointly implied by the combination of empirical time series and the hypthesized structure of the system, as captured in the mathematical model. It is important to stress that a key motivation for conducting particle filtering to infer latent state in this way lies in the fact that reliable understanding of such latent state is important for estimating the impact of interventions enacted at that point. By estimating the latent state of the system using particle filtering, we can then conduct &#x201C;what if&#x201D; scenarios forward from that point, each of which characterize the effects of interventions. Accurate estimation of the state of the system prior to initiation of different intervention strategies will frequently be an important enabler for accurately assessing the differential effects of those interventions.</p>
<p>The particle filtering algorithm in general also has important limitations, such as information loss and particle collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] during the evolutionary process of the particles. These limitations are also inherited in the algorithm applying in this paper that combines particle filtering with a compartmental transmission models. Moreover, the treatment here further suffers from some further challenges. For simplicity, the condensation algorithm is employed in calculating the proposal distribution. However, this algorithm may contribute to a loss of the diversity of particle filtering models. These limitations could be relieved by taking more particles during the calculation, or restricting the particles in appropriate range of changes by selecting the values of parameters in more tightly informed ranges. Finally, a key limitation in terms of practical implications the findings in the developed world reflects the fact that we have focused on prediction in a non-vaccine context; there remains a key uncertainty as to the degree to which the approach proposed here will offer high predictive capacity in the context of sporadic, low attack rate outbreaks characteristic of measles epidemiology in developed countries within the vaccination era.</p>
<p>Much work remains to be undertaken. While particle filtering techniques we investigated in this paper have immediate application in populations with low vaccine coverage (including isolated pockets of population or individuals who refuse vaccination in jurisdictions with otherwise high vaccination coverage), in the future, we will consider vaccination state in the measles particle filter model, to simulate the measles transmission pattern in high vaccination regions in the vaccination era more broadly. Such a model could be helpful for predicting the outbreak of measles in regions suffering from borderline or waning vaccination rates due to vaccine hesitancy, health disparities or other causes. We further plan to apply more powerful techniques, such as Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods that can allow for jointly estimating the latent state of the model and static parameter values whose values are poorly known. Finally, we also plan to investigate more sophisticated means of predicting outbreak occurrence based on particle filtering results. It appears likely that such refinements will further enhance the already strong advantages conferred by particle filtering methods and variants in measles transmission modeling.</p>
<p>We conclude that anticipating the epidemic pattern of measles in low vaccination regions by applying particle filtering with simple measles transmission models so as to recurrently incorporate successive elements of time series of reported case counts is a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in estimating risk and magnitude of measles outbreaks. Such approaches offer particularly strong value proposition for other pathogens with little-known dynamics, critical latent drivers, and in the context of the growing emergence of high-velocity electronic data sources. Additional strong benefits will be realized by extending the application of this technique to highly vaccinated populations.</p>

<title>The introduction of the mathematical SEIR model</title>
<p>This project employs a measles SEIR model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] as the disease transmission component of the state-equation model in particle filtering. A time unit of months is used, so as to be consistent with the empirical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Moreover, while the original model lacked age stratification, we also explore an age structured variant of the model. The two model variants used in this paper are introduced as follows.</p>

<p>This model, which can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], contains 4 state variables: (S-Susceptible, E-Exposure, I-Infectious, R-Recovered). The original model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] makes use of a formulation in which each state variable is of unit dimension, representing a fraction of the entire population. However, for the sake of comparison against empirical data, the model in this paper is represented in a re-dimensionalized fashion, with the state variables representing counts of persons. In the first step, we re-dimensionalized the original model. The resulting aggregate compartmental equations are as follows:

</disp-formula></p>
<p>The meaning of the states and parameters are as follows: S, E, I and R are the count of Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered people in the population, respectively. N is the total number of people, and N&#x003D;S&#x002B;E&#x002B;I&#x002B;R. <italic>&#x03C5;</italic> is the birth rate (of unit 1/Month) and <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> is the death rate (also of unit 1/Month). <italic>&#x03C3;</italic><sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and <italic>&#x03B3;</italic><sup>&#x2212;1</sup> are the mean incubation and infectious periods (in months) of the disease, respectively. <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> is the rate of effective contact between individuals, and reflects both the contact rate and transmission probability (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> &#x003D; contact rate &#x00D7; transmission probability), and is thus of unit 1/Month. The population size N was obtained from Saskatchewan during the years from 1921 to 1956. We take the mean of the population across these years to be the value of parameter N. This is associated with the empirical dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. As noted below, while <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> was treated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] as a constant, we took advantage of particle filtering by allowing it to vary over the course of the timeframe explored.

<title>Re-dimensionalized age structured model</title>
<p>Measles has a severe impact on children&#x2019;s health and is one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. Measles transmission pattern may be different among different age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. For example, the age composition of daily contacts may be different for different age groups; children may spend more time with other children and their caregivers, rather than with other adults. Moreover, the rates of contacts sufficiently close to transmitting infection can differ between age groups, such as due to hygienic disparities. To capture such differences, beyond the original model, we created a version of the SEIR model stratified by two age groups: children and adults.</p>
<p>In this variant of the mathematical model, we use subscripts &#x201C;c&#x201D; and &#x201C;a&#x201D; for a quantity to denote the child- and adult-specific values of that quantity, respectively. We further assume in the demographic model (whose formulation and derivation are introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]), that the population of each age group (<italic>N<sub>c</sub>,N<sub>a</sub></italic>) does not change.

<title>Introduction to particle filter</title>
<p>Particle filtering is a modern methodology that fits into the broader &#x201C;statistical filtering&#x201D; tradition that, as time passes, combines estimates generated by a dynamic model (a model that simulates the evolution of a system over time) with arriving empirical observations. As new data arrives, statistical filtering methods provide a means of arriving at a sort of &#x201C;consensus estimate&#x201D; for the current state of the system (as represented by the simulation model) &#x2013; an estimate that recognizes and balances uncertainty associated with the model (on the one hand) with uncertainty with regards to the observations (on the other). Particle filtering is a very well established contemporary statistical filtering method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] that is widely employed in fields such as robotics but comparatively new in the sphere of health modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Each of the states in the distribution for a given time can be seen as representing a competing hypothesis concerning the underlying state of the system at that time, and the Particle Filtering itself can be viewed as undertaking a &#x201C;survival of the fittest&#x201D; of these hypotheses, with fitness determined by the consistency between the expectations of the hypothesis as to what should be observed at observations times, and what is in fact observed at each of those times. Drawing on the theory of Sequential Importance Sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], this distribution is characterized as a collection of importance-weighted samples, each of which is termed a &#x201C;particle&#x201D;. At an intuitive level, a particle&#x2019;s weight at the current time represents an approximation to the probability of the state represented by that particle in fact obtaining at that time. This weight is, in turn, determined by the consistency of the state being hypothesized by that particle with the observations, as quantified by a likelihood function specifying the likelihood of making a given observation in light of the state captured by the particle.</p>

<title>Classifying outbreak occurrence</title>
<p>In this paper, we also investigate the effectiveness of using the particle filtering model in predicting the outbreak of measles in the next time unit (month). The goal of this classification is to map from the reported cases of measles predicted by particle filtering model in the next month to the class of outbreak or non-outbreak. This mapping can be represented by the following equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]:

The value <italic>I</italic><sub>rpk</sub> is generated by the particle filtering models. Specifically, the <italic>I</italic><sub>rpk</sub> equals <italic>I</italic><sub>rmk</sub> in the aggregated particle filtering model (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq (11)</xref>), and equals <italic>I<sub>rmck</sub></italic> &#x002B; <italic>I<sub>rmak</sub></italic> in the two age groups structured models (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eq (15)</xref>).</p>
<p>Two processes are then used to perform the classification analysis of the results from particle filtering models. In the first process, we define a threshold (<italic>&#x03B8;</italic><sub>ik</sub>) of a particle <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>k</italic> above which to consider that particle as positing an outbreak. In the second process, we define a threshold of fraction (<italic>&#x03B8;<sub>k</sub></italic>) of particles required to posit an outbreak at time <italic>k</italic> for us to consider there as being an outbreak. Then, the vector of determining whether there is an outbreak of measles in each month &#x2013; <italic>z<sub>k</sub></italic> &#x2013; is calculated.</p>
<p>We further denote <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="340661_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> as the empirical vector of whether a measles outbreak indeed obtained at time <italic>k, y<sub>lk</sub></italic> &#x2208; &#x007B;0,1&#x007D;. The calculation method of <italic>y<sub>lk</sub></italic> is similar to that of each particle. If the measles reported cases is greater or equal than the threshold <italic>&#x03B8;</italic><sub>ik</sub>, the related element in vector <italic>y<sub>lk</sub></italic> is labeled to be outbreak (the value is 1). Otherwise, non-outbreak (the value is 0).</p>
<p>Finally, to summarize the performance of the classifier, we employ metrics such as the confusion matrix, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, etc. Readers interested in additional detail are referred to S5 Appendix.</p>

Except for the basic states in the SEIR model (S, E, I, R), models of infection transmission are often related to more complex dynamics &#x2013; such as parameters evolving according to stochastic processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h2">
<title>Aggregate model</title>
<p>In the aggregate model (i.e., the model not stratified by age), three essential stochastic processes are considered. Firstly, we consider changes in the transmissible contact rate linking infectious and susceptible persons, which is represented by the parameter <italic>&#x03B2;</italic>. A second area in which we consider parameter evolution is with respect to the disease reporting process. Specifically, to simulate this process, a parameter &#x2013; representing the probability that a given measles infectious case is reported <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic>, and a state <italic>I<sub>m</sub></italic> &#x2013; calculating the accumulative measles infectious cases per unit time (per Month in this paper) &#x2013; are implemented. Finally, the model includes a stochastic process (specifically, a Poisson process) associated with incidence of infection. This process reflects the small number of cases that occur over each small unit of time (&#x0394;<italic>t</italic>). The stochastics associated with these factors represents a composite of two factors. Firstly, there is expected to both be stochastic variability in the measles infection processes and some evolution in the underlying transmission dynamics in terms of changes in reporting rate, and changes in mixing. Secondly, such stochastic variability allows characterization of uncertainty associated with respect to model dynamics &#x2013; reflecting the fact that both the observations and the model dynamics share a high degree of fallability. Given an otherwise deterministic simulation model such as that considered here, there is a particular need to incorporate added stochastic variability in parameters and flows capture the uncertainty in simulation results.</p>
<p>To estimate the changing values of these two stochastic parameters (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic> and <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic>) and to investigate the capacity of the particle filter to adapt to parameters whose effective values evolve over simulation, the state associated with each particle includes the contact transmission rate <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> and reported rate <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic>. Thus, each particle in this project is associated with a state vector <italic>x</italic> &#x003D; [<italic>S, E, I, R, &#x03B2;, C<sub>r</sub>, I<sub>m</sub></italic>]<sup>T</sup>.</p>
<p>Reflecting the fact that the transmissible contact rate <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> varies over the entire range of positive real numbers, we treat the natural logarithm of the transmissible contact rate (denoted by <italic>&#x03B2;</italic>) as undergoing a random walk according to a Wiener Process (Brownian Motion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The stochastic differential equation of transmissible contact rate can thus be described according to Stratonovich notation as:

In this paper, we selected an initial value of <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> following a uniform distribution in the interval [40, 160) across all particles. Unless otherwise noted, the constant value of the diffusion coefficient <italic>s<sub>&#x03B2;</sub></italic> used is 0.8.</p>
<p>Over the multi-decadal model time horizon, and particularly on account of shifting risk perception, there can be notable evolution in the degree to which infected individuals or their guardians seek care. To capture this evolution, we consider evolution in the fraction of underlying measles cases that are reported (denoted by <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic>). Reflective of the fact that <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> varies over the range [0, 1], we characterize the logit of <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> as also undergoing Brownian Motion according to Stratonovich notation as:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="340661_eqn8.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where the initial value of <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> among particles follows a uniform distribution in the interval [0.11, 0.15). The diffusion coefficient (<italic>s<sub>r</sub></italic>) associated with the perturbations to the logit of <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> over <italic>dt</italic> is selected to be a constant 0.03 across all particles in this paper.</p>
<p>To incorporate the empirical data, we further implement a convenience state <italic>I<sub>m</sub></italic> with respect to the cumulative count of infectious cases per unit time (Month). The state <italic>I<sub>m</sub></italic> is different from the state <italic>I</italic>. Specifically, the state of an cumulative count of infectious cases per unit time <italic>I<sub>m</sub></italic> only considers all the inflows to the infectious state and without all the outflows, to simulate the same process of reporting the measles cases in the real world. The cumulative infectious cases <italic>I<sub>m</sub></italic> of measles at time <italic>k</italic> is:

<p>In total, the compartmental model without age stratification is the combination of the classic SEIR model and these three stochastic processes:

</disp-formula></p>
<p>To solve the system above, we made use of Euler integration with a time step of 0.01 Month (i.e., &#x25B3;<italic>t</italic>&#x003D; 0.01 Month in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq (11)</xref>). The same approach was also used in the stratified system presented in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn15">Eq (15)</xref> below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h3">
<title>Age stratified model</title>
<p>In the age stratified model, four stochastic parameters and two extra states are considered dynamically, compared with the original SEIR model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eqs (2)</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">(5)</xref>). The stochastic process related to incidence of infection is also considered in the age structured state space model, as in the aggregated model above (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq (11)</xref>). The first stochastic parameter is the same as in the aggregate group model: the disease reporting process parameter (<italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic>), whose dynamics are characterized according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq (8)</xref>. The second is the rate of transmissible contacts between infectious persons and susceptible persons of child age group, which is represented by the parameter (<italic>&#x03B2;<sub>c</sub></italic>) in the age structured model &#x2013; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq (2)</xref>. The equation and chosen values of (<italic>&#x03B2;<sub>c</sub></italic>) are the same with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">Eq (7)</xref>. The third stochastic parameter (<italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic>) represents the ratio of the adult age group&#x2019;s transmissible contact rate (<italic>&#x03B2;<sub>a</sub></italic>) to that of the child age group (<italic>&#x03B2;<sub>c</sub></italic>). And we have <italic>&#x03B2;<sub>a</sub></italic> &#x003D; <italic>M<sub>a</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>c</sub></italic>. Reflecting the fact that this parameter represents a non-negative real number, similar to the rate of transmissible contacts (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic>) in the aggregate state space model, we treat the natural logarithm of <italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic> as undergoing a random walk according to a Brownian motion:
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="340661_eqn12.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>It is a widespread perception that because of limited hygienic awareness and other factors, children are subject to higher rates of transmissible contact than adults. This would suggest that the value of the multiplier <italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic> normally less than 1.0. Thus, we elected to impose an initial value of <italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic> across all particles as drawn from a uniform distribution with support [0.2, 1). And, the diffusion coefficient (<italic>s<sub>M<sub>a</sub></sub></italic>) associated with the evolution of <italic>d</italic>(<italic>lnM<sub>a</sub></italic>) is chosen to be a constant value of 0.5 among all particles.</p>
<p>The fourth stochastic parameter in the stratified model is the fraction of the contact of children that occurs with other children, denoted as <italic>f<sub>cc</sub></italic>. This parameter appears in the contact matrix, and varies over the range from 0 to 1. As a result, the dynamic process for <italic>f<sub>cc</sub></italic> is similar to the disease report rating <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic> with the <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq (8)</xref>, specifically:
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="340661_eqn13.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The initial value of <italic>f<sub>cc</sub></italic> we employed follows a uniform distribution in the interval [0.2, 1.0). We assumed a constant value of 0.2 as the diffusion coefficient (<italic>s<sub>cc</sub></italic>) associated with the logit of <italic>f<sub>cc</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, the new state of cumulative infectious count per unit time is implemented similar to aggregate model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq (9)</xref>), except for its division into two distinct states according to stratification into two age groups (<italic>I<sub>mc</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>ma</sub></italic>). The discrete time equations of <italic>I<sub>mc</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>ma</sub></italic> and reported infectious count per unit time in model <italic>I<sub>rmc</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>rma</sub></italic> at time k are as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<alternatives>
<graphic xlink:href="340661_eqn14.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The state vector <italic>x<sup>N</sup></italic> is [<italic>S<sub>c</sub>, S<sub>a</sub>, E<sub>c</sub>, E<sub>a</sub>, I<sub>c</sub>, I<sub>a</sub>, R<sub>c</sub>, R<sub>a</sub>, &#x03B2;<sub>c</sub>, M<sub>a</sub>, f<sub>cc</sub>, C<sub>r</sub>, I<sub>mc</sub>, I<sub>ma</sub></italic>] in the age stratified model, and N equals 14.

<graphic xlink:href="340661_eqn15.gif"/>
</alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Reflective of the structure of the age group stratification in available data, it is notable that we have considered two different age group configurations in this paper: one where the child age group includes those up to 5 years old (<italic>M<sub>age_5</sub></italic>) and another where it includes those up to 15 years old (<italic>M<sub>age&#x005F;15</sub></italic>).</p>

<title>The measurement model</title>
<p>As introduced in particle filtering tutorials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], the measurement model characterizes the relationship between the measured data and the model.

<title>Likelihood function</title>
<p>In this project, the observed data is of two types &#x2013; the monthly reported incidence case count of measles and annual reported cases within different age groups. As previously introduced, the measured data is the reported cases of measles in this paper. The likelihood function <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="340661_inline22.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> describes such a reporting process, and specifies the probability that a given measles case in the dynamic model will be measured. We followed several past contributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] in selecting the negative binomial distribution as the basis for the likelihood function, which allows for greater robustness than the classic binomial distribution. Readers interested in additional detail are referred to S6 Appendix.</p>
<p>The equation associated with the likelihood function is thus as follows:

<title>Aggregate model</title>
<p>In the aggregate model, because the model lacks the capacity to distinguish between individuals within different age groups as necessary to compare to the yearly age-stratified reported values, the measured data is a one-dimensional vector consisting of the monthly reported cases. It indicates that the weight update rule (likelihood function) of the aggregate model could simply achieved by calculating the value of <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y<sub>mk</sub></italic>|<italic>I<sub>rmk</sub></italic>), where (<italic>y<sub>mk</sub></italic> is the empirical data as given by the monthly reported measles cases at time <italic>k</italic>, and <italic>I<sub>rmk</sub></italic> is the reported cases calculated by the dynamic model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4l">
<title>Age stratified model</title>
<p>In the age stratified model, the weight update rule is similar to that in the aggregate model, except for the update associated with the close of each year. Specifically, the weights of particles associated with the age stratified model from January to November are only updated by the monthly empirical data &#x2013; monthly measles reported cases at each time (using the likelihood function given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn18">Eq (18)</xref>). However, the weight at the end of the last month (December) of each year is updated by the combination of three parts. The likelihood formulation of age stratified model is listed as follows:

where <italic>L<sub>month</sub></italic> is the likelihood function based on the monthly empirical data for the total population.

<title>Evaluating particle filter performance</title>
<p>To assess the accuracy of particle filtering for robust estimation of model states, it is essential to evaluate the estimation and predictive capacity of the particle filtered models. In this project, we therefore sought to calculate the discrepancy at each observation time (Month in this paper) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] between the model generated data and empirical data, using a linear measure. Reflecting the dual sources of data employed, the discrepancy includes monthly discrepancy and yearly discrepancy, with the total discrepancy representing the sum of these quantities.</p>
<p>Typically, there will be thousands of particles included in each model run. To calculate the discrepancy of particle filter results by incorporating empirical data across all time points, we sample n particles by importance sampling for each such time. The monthly discrepancy of each time is simply the Root Mean Squared error (RMSE) between the monthly empirical data at that time and the related data calculated by the particle filtering model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To get the yearly discrepancy of each time (here, successive Months), the RMSE was calculated for each age group of each year (similary to monthly discrepancy). Then the yearly discrepancy is the sum across all age groups of the yearly RMSE over 12 (to convert the unit to Month).</p>
<p>Moreover, to investigate the predictive capability and efficiency of particle filter model, we defined a variable &#x201C;Prediction Start Time&#x201D;, denoted by <italic>T</italic>&#x002A;; it indicates the time 1 &#x2264; <italic>k</italic> &#x003C; <italic>T</italic>&#x002A; up to which the weights of particles are updated based on the observed data. When <italic>k</italic> &#x2265; <italic>T</italic>&#x002A;, the particle filtering ceases &#x2013; the weights of particles are no longer updated and no further re-sampling occurs. During that period (i.e., following the Prediction Start Time), particles simply continue to evolve according to the state space model shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn11">Eq (11)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eq (15)</xref> (depending on whether an age-specific model is being applied). For such a Prediction Start Time <italic>T</italic>&#x002A;, the model calculated a prediction discrepancy using a simple variant of the strategy of the discrepancy used in considering all the time frame, but limited to considering only times <italic>T</italic>&#x002A; and larger.</p>

<title>Empirical dataset</title>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>Measles reported cases</title>
<p>In this project, the empirical data consists of the time series from 1921 to 1956 of reported measles cases for the mid-western Canadian province of Saskatchewan. These aggregate data are obtained from Annual Report of the Saskatchewan Department of Public Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We have employed two datasets: monthly reported measles cases aggregated across the total population and yearly reported cases in each of different age groups. In the empirical yearly dataset, these yearly reported cases are split into different age groups. In a small minority of years (from 1926 to 1941), the age categories present in the reported data do not correspond neatly to the age group categories in the models (considering children as being those within their first 5 years or first 15 years). For these cases, we split them into the age categories of the models proportionally. Readers interested in additional detail are referred to S7 Appendix.</p>
<p>We consider the pre-vaccination era of measles within Saskatchewan to study the natural dynamics of measles in low vaccination areas. The time of the monthly empirical data is from Jan. 1921 to Dec. 1956, with the monthly dataset offering a total of 432 records. The yearly age specific data are from 1925 to 1956, reflecting the fact that reporting of age specific data is only started in 1925. Every record contains three features &#x2013; date, measles reported cases and population size. To make them consistent with the total population size of the dynamic model (863,545), the empirical data are normalized to the same population size of the model. The normalized monthly empirical data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Fig 13</xref>; it can be readily appreciated that the time series demonstrates the classic patterns of waxing and waning incorporating both stochastics and regularities characteristic of many childhood infectious diseases in the pre-vaccination era.</p>

From 1921 to 1956, the empirical population lies in the interval from 757,000 to 932,000. And the empirical total population of Saskatchewan in these years does not exhibit drastic fluctuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Thus, we let the model population remain constant at 863,545, which represents the mean population over that interval. Also, the monthly total and yearly age groups&#x2019; empirical measles reported cases are normalized to the model population. It is notable that we employ an equilibrium population model &#x2013; the total population and population among each age group will stay the same, rather than change. Similarly, the values of the population in each age group also employs the average population among 1921 to 1956 in their age group as given by the age pyramid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
