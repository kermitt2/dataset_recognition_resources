<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Phototrophic microorganisms are promising resources for green biotechnology. Compared to heterotrophic microorganisms, however, the cellular economy of phototrophic growth is still insufficiently understood. We provide a quantitative analysis of light-limited, light-saturated, and light-inhibited growth of the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 within a reproducible cultivation setup. We report key physiological parameters, including growth rate, cell size, and photosynthetic activity over a wide range of light intensities. Intracellular proteins were quantified to monitor proteome allocation as a function of growth rate. Among other physiological adaptations, we identify an upregulation of the translational machinery and downregulation of light harvesting components with increasing light intensity and growth rate. The resulting growth laws are discussed in the context of a coarse-grained model of phototrophic growth and available data obtained by a comprehensive literature search. Our insights into quantitative aspects of cyanobacterial adaptations to different growth rates have implications to understand and optimize photosynthetic productivity.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Cyanobacteria are key primary producers in many, if not most, ecosystems and are an integral part of the global biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycle. Due to their fast growth rates, high productivity and amenability to genetic manipulations, cyanobacteria are considered as promising host organisms for synthesis of renewable bioproducts from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Al-Haj et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2016</xref>), and serve as important model organisms to understand and improve photosynthetic productivity.</p>
<p>Understanding the cellular limits of photosynthetic productivity in cyanobacteria, however, requires quantitative data about cellular physiology and growth: accurate accounting is central to understand the organization, growth and proliferation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">V&#x00E1;zquez-Laslop and Mankin, 2014</xref>). While quantitative insight into the cellular economy of phototrophic microorganisms is still scarce, the cellular economy of heterotrophic growth has been studied extensively&#x2014;starting with the seminal works of Monod, Neidhardt, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Neidhardt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Neidhardt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jun et al., 2018</xref>) to more recent quantitative studies of microbial resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Molenaar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klumpp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Scott and Hwa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bosdriesz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maitra and Dill, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wei&#x00DF;e et al., 2015</xref>). In response to changing environments, heterotrophic microorganisms are known to differentially allocate their protein resources: with increasing growth rate, heterotrophic microorganisms typically exhibit upregulation of ribosomes and other proteins related to translation and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Molenaar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Peebo et al., 2015</xref>), exhibit complex changes in transcription profiles, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klumpp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Matsumoto et al., 2013</xref>), as well as increased cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular limits of heterotrophic growth have been described thoroughly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Erickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Metzl-Raz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Klumpp et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, only few studies so far have addressed the limits of cyanobacterial growth from an experimental perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abernathy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ungerer et al., 2018</xref>). Of particular interest were the adaptations that enable fast photoautotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abernathy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ungerer et al., 2018</xref>). The cyanobacterium with the highest known photoautotrophic growth rate, growing with a doubling time of up to <italic>T<sub>D</sub></italic> &#x007E; 1.9h, is the strain <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> UTEX 2973. Compared to its closest relative, <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942, the strain shows several physiological adaptation, such as higher PSI and cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> content per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ungerer et al., 2018</xref>), lower metabolite pool in central metabolism, less glycogen accumulation, and higher electron charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abernathy et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, high light was reported to promote the transcription of genes associated with central metabolic pathways, repression of phycobilisome genes, and accelerated glycogen accumulation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tan et al., 2018</xref>)</p>
<p>While these studies point to strain-specific differences and are important for characterizing non-model microbial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abernathy et al., 2017</xref>), the general principles of resource allocation in photoautotrophic metabolism and the laws of phototrophic growth are still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide a consistent quantitative dataset of cyanobacterial physiology and protein abundance for a range of different light intensities and growth rates&#x2014;and put the data in the context of published values obtained by a comprehensive literature search as well as in the context of a recent model of photosynthetic resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faizi et al., 2018</xref>). To this end, we chose the widely used model strain <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (<italic>Synechocystis</italic> hereafter). Since <italic>Synechocystis</italic> exhibits significant variations with respect to genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ikeuchi and Tabata, 2001</xref>) and phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Morris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zavrel et al., 2017</xref>), we chose the substrain GT-L, a strain that has a documented stable phenotype for at least four years preceding this study. All data are obtained under highly reproducible and controlled experimental conditions, using flat-panel photobioreactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nedbal et al., 2008</xref>) within an identical setup as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>).</p>
<p>The data obtained in this work provide a resource for quantitative insight into the allocation of cellular components during light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited growth. In dependence of the light intensity and growth rate, we monitor key physiological properties, such as changes in cell size, dry weight, gas (CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) exchange, as well as changes in abundance of pigments, DNA, total protein, and glycogen. Using proteomics, we show that &#x007E; 57&#x0025; (779 out of 1356 identified proteins) proteins change their abundance in dependence of growth rate, whereas the rest was independent of growth rate. A detailed analysis of changes in individual protein fractions revealed phototrophic &#x201C;growth laws&#x201D;: abundances of proteins associated with light harvesting decreased with increasing light intensity and growth rate, whereas abundances of proteins associated with translation and biosynthesis increased with increasing light intensity and growth rate&#x2014;in good agreement with recent computational models of cyanobacterial resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burnap, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">R&#x00FC;gen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faizi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Establishing a controlled and reproducible cultivation setup</title>
<p>The <italic>Synechocystis</italic> substrain GT-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>) was cultivated in flat panel photobioreactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) using at least 5 independent reactors in a quasi-continuous (turbidostat) regime, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, with red light intensities of 27.5 &#x2212; 1100 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, supplemented with a blue light intensity of 27.5 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The addition of blue light avoids possible growth limitations in the absence of short wavelength photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Golden, 1995</xref>). Steady-state specific growth rates in turbidostat mode were calculated from monitoring the optical density measured at a wavelength of 680 nm (OD<sub>680</sub>) as well as from the rate of depletion of spare cultivation medium (as measured by top loading balances). Both methods resulted in similar average values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Estimation of the specific growth rate based on the medium depletion, however, exhibited higher variance. For further analysis, therefore, only values obtained from the OD<sub>680</sub> signal are reported.</p>

<p>The measured specific growth rates increased from <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> &#x003D; 0. 025 &#x00B1; 0.002 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> &#x003D; 0.104 &#x00B1; 0.009 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (corresponding to doubling times of <italic>T<sub>D</sub></italic> &#x2248; 27.7h &#x2014; 6.9h) with increasing light intensities up to 660 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> of red light. For higher light intensities the cultures exhibited photoinhibition&#x2014;a reduction of the specific growth rate induced by high light intensities. Under the highest intensity of 1100 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the specific growth rate decreased to <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> &#x003D; 0.093 &#x00B1; 0.011 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to a doublingtime of <italic>T<sub>D</sub></italic> &#x003D; 7.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). The growth curve is consistent with previous measurements of cyanobacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cordara et al., 2018</xref>) and can be subdivided into three phases: light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited growth.</p>
<p>The cultivation condition were highly controlled and reproducible, with (red) light intensity as the only variable. Temperature (32&#x00B0;C) and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of sparging gas (0.5&#x0025;) were set to saturate <italic>Synechocystis</italic> growth in the exponential phase (OD<sub>680</sub> &#x003D; 0.60 &#x2212; 0.66), as established earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>). Addition of selected nutrients (including Na, N, S, Ca, Mg, P and Fe) was tested to ensure absence of growth limitations by these nutrients (see Figure 1 - Figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>The experimental setup, including the photobioreactor setup, light quality and intensity, temperature, composition of cultivation medium, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in sparging gas, bubbling and stirring rate was identical to the setup used in previous studies for this substrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2017</xref>). We therefore could evaluate the stability of the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 GT-L phenotype throughout a four year period (2013 &#x2013; 2017). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref> show a comparison of the specific growth, as well as photosynthetic and respiration rates, from several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2017</xref>) and as yet unpublished data.</p>

<title>Photosynthesis and respiration increase with light intensity and growth rate</title>
<p>The cultivation setup included a probe for dissolved oxygen (dO<sub>2</sub>) and a gas analysing unit to measure CO<sub>2</sub> in the gas efflux. Online measurements of gas exchange rates allowed to assess respiration rates (measured as O<sub>2</sub> uptake rate during a 5 minutes dark period, see Materials and Methods) as well as photosynthetic activity (net O2 release rate and net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rate). Both photosynthetic activity and respiration rates increased with increasing light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Between a light intensity of 27.5 and 880 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the photosynthetic activity (O<sub>2</sub> release) increased from 30.5 &#x00B1; 5.7 &#x03BC;mol(O<sub>2</sub>) mmol (Chl)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 251.6&#x00B1;49.4 &#x03BC;mol(O<sub>2</sub>) mmol (Chl)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the respiration rate increased from 5.5&#x00B1;2.7 &#x03BC;mol(O<sub>2</sub>) mmol (Chl)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 40.9 &#x00B1; 14.6 &#x03BC;mol(O<sub>2</sub>) mmol (Chl)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest were changes in gas exchange as a function of the specific growth rate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows gas exchange rates as a function of the specific growth rate per gram cellular dry weight (gDW), as well as per cell.

<title>Cell morphology and composition acclimate to changes in light intensity and growth rate</title>
<p>Culture samples were harvested under different light intensities to investigate the allocation of key cellular components as a function of growth rate. Cellular parameters included cell count, cell size, cell dry mass, as well as concentrations of glycogen, total protein, total DNA, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, and carotenoids. The data (normalized per gDW as well as per cell) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as a function of the specific growth rate, and the data as a function of light intensity are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> - Source data 1.</p>
<p>With increasing growth rate, the volume and weight of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). The cell diameter increased from 1.96 &#x00B1; 0.03 &#x03BC;m to 2.19 &#x00B1; 0.03 &#x03BC;m, and slightly decreased again under photoinhibition. Since <italic>Synechocystis</italic> has a spherical cell shape, the estimated diameters correspond to cell volumes ranging from 3.97 &#x03BC;m<sup>3</sup> to 5.49 &#x03BC;m<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Changes in cell volume were reflected in changes in cellular dry weight. Dry weight per cell increased from 5.3 &#x00B1; 1.7 pg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for the slowest specific growth rate to 11.3 &#x00B1; 2.3 pg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> at the maximal growth rate. Under photoinhibition, cellular dry weight again decreased to 8.6 &#x00B1; 2.6 pg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1). The ratio of cellular dry weight to cell volume showed no significant change for different growth rates (Kruskal-Wallis test: <italic>p</italic> &#x2212; <italic>value</italic> &#x003D; 0.077).</p>
<p>The amount of glycogen per gDW increased with increasing growth rate, from 84 &#x00B1; 28 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 199 &#x00B1; 35 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> for the maximal growth rate, and further increased to 229 &#x00B1; 72 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> under the conditions of photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These values correspond to an increase of glycogen per cell from 440 &#x00B1; 79 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> to 2329 &#x00B1; 504 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the protein content per gDW decreased with increasing growth rate. Protein content per cell, however, did not significantly change for different light intensities and growth rates (Kruskal-Wallis test: <italic>p</italic> &#x2212; <italic>value</italic> &#x003D; 0.076). The absolute values of protein content were between 402 &#x00B1; 144 and 227&#x00B1;6 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and between 2144&#x00B1;482 and 2937 &#x00B1; 466 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in DNA content were only estimated in relative units and are reported relative to the DNA content at the lowest growth rate. With increasing growth rate, the DNA content normalized per gDW decreased to 51 &#x00B1; 11&#x0025; of the initial value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). The (relative) DNA content per cell, however, increased with increasing growth rate up to 137&#x00B1; 19&#x0025; of its initial value. Under conditions of photoinhibition, the relative DNA content per cell decreased again to 94 &#x00B1; 29&#x0025; of the initial value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>
<p>Relative to gDW, the amounts of phycobiliproteins, chlorophyll a and carotenoids decreased with increasing growth rate. Under the conditions of photoinhibition, we observed an additional reduction of these pigments per gDW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,M</xref>). When considering the concentrations per cell, however, the respective amounts initially increased with increasing growth rates, and decreased again under conditions of photoinhibition. Overall, pigment content decreased with increasing light intensity (irrespective of normalization), with the exception of carotenoids which exhibited a slight increase per cell as a function of light intensity. The changes of pigment amounts as a function of growth rate (relative to gDW as well as per cell) were significant (Kruskal-Wallis test: <italic>p</italic> &#x2212; <italic>value</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, see Materials and Methods for further details). The absolute amounts of phycocyanin were between 86.4 &#x00B1; 30.7 and 26.5 &#x00B1; 7.5 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to 172 &#x00B1; 29 and 620 &#x00B1; 63 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,L</xref>), the amounts of allophycocyanin were between 14.8&#x00B1;5.3 and 6.7&#x00B1; 1.9 mggDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to 57 &#x00B1; 10 and 123 &#x00B1; 15 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,L</xref>).</p>
<p>The absolute amounts of chlorophyll a were between 16&#x00B1; 5.2 and 5.8 &#x00B1; 1.6 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to a range between 50 &#x00B1; 10 and 96 &#x00B1; 14 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>), the absolute amounts of carotenoids were between 4.4&#x00B1;0.7 and 2.6 &#x00B1; 0.5 mg gDW<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to a range between 22 &#x00B1; 3 and 29 &#x00B1; 6 fg cell<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>).</p>
<p>To put the data into context, we conducted a literature research with respect to reported physiological parameters of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803. The results are summarized in Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2. The data include also meta information on experimental conditions.

<title>Proteome allocation as a function of growth rate</title>
<p>Culture samples for 6 light intensities were harvested to obtain quantitative proteome profiles using mass spectrometry, with at least 5 biological replicates for each light intensity. The results of the proteomics analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We identified 1356 proteins (the complete list is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> - Source data 1).

The complete list of growth dependent and growth independent proteins is provided in Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1 and Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2, respectively. We then obtained functional annotation for all 1356 proteins using the Gene Ontology (GO) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>). Of the 779 growth-dependent proteins, 450 were annotated with a non-trivial category (excluding categories such as <italic>unknown</italic> or <italic>putative</italic>), of the 577 growth-independent proteins, 303 were annotated with a non-trivial category. To facilitate analysis, the functional annotation was mapped to a subset GO slim (higher level GO terms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Klopfenstein et al.

<p>To allow for a more detailed analysis of growth-dependent proteins, the changes in abundance of the 779 proteins were grouped into 7 clusters using <italic>k</italic>-means clustering (Figure 3 - Figure supplement 3). The number of clusters was determined using the elbow method. The identified clusters either corresponded to upregulation of protein abundance with growth rate (cluster 1 and 6), downregulation (cluster 2, 5, 7) or more complex changes (cluster 3 and 4). The results of the clustering analysis are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, along with an annotation matrix that highlights the prevalent function (GO slim) categories for each cluster. The growth-dependent proteins encompass 37 distinct annotations mapped to GO slim.</p>
<p>Cluster 1 (192 proteins) and 6 (41 proteins) exhibit increasing abundance for increasing light intensity and growth rate. Prevalent annotations are <italic>biosynthetic processes</italic>, such as <italic>cellular nitrogen compound metabolic processes, cellular amino acid metabolic processes</italic>, as well as, for cluster 1, <italic>translation.</italic> Cluster with low variation (Cluster 2, 218 proteins) and cluster with ambiguous shapes (cluster 4, 124 proteins) exhibit a similar set of categories as cluster 1 and 6. In contrast, both clusters that exhibit a clear decrease with increasing light intensity and growth rate (cluster 5, 65 proteins and cluster 7, 79 proteins) are both annotated with <italic>photosynthesis</italic> as highest-ranking annotation. Finally, cluster 3 (2 proteins) exhibits a sharp upregulation during photoinhibition, both proteins are annotated with the categories <italic>transport</italic> and <italic>transmembrane processes</italic>.</p>
<p>We note that, similar to some of the physiological properties shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the abundances of clusters 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 exhibited a characteristic &#x201C;kink&#x201D; at high growth rates corresponding to a sharp up- or downregulation under photoinhibition.</p>

<title>Visualization of functional annotation using proteomaps</title>
<p>To complement the clustering analysis, we used the proteomaps software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteomaps.net">proteomaps.net</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liebermeister et al., 2014</xref>)) to visualize the relative abundances of the identified proteins for different light conditions. To this end, iBAQ intensities were used as an approximation for quantitative protein amounts. We emphasize that, while iBAQ intensities are roughly proportional to the molar amounts of the proteins, iBAQ intensities only refer to identified proteins and do not reflect the whole proteome (hence the proportionality factor could change from sample to sample). Therefore, the intensities are interpreted only as an approximation that provide insight into expected overall abundances.</p>

<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faizi et al. (2018)</xref>, all kinetic parameters were sourced from the primary literature, except the parameters for the photosynthetic cross section, photosynthetic turnover rate, and the rate constant for photoinhibition (see Materials and Methods). These 3 parameters were fitted numerically, such that the predicted maximal growth rate <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>) matched the experimental values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The stoichiometry and energy requirements for biosynthesis were approximated using a genome-scale model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Knoop et al., 2013</xref>). All parameters and model definitions are provided in Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the model is based on the assumption of (evolutionary) optimality. That is, the model is solved using an optimization algorithm that maximizes the specific growth rate <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> as a function of protein allocation. In this way, the model is able to predict how the coarse-grained proteome fractions are optimally allocated with increasing light intensity. These predictions provide a reference to which data can be compared. We emphasize that such a comparison does not presuppose that proteome allocation in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is necessarily optimal.</p>
<p>Model predictions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, together with data from the experimental analysis. The protein fraction associated with biosynthesis (<italic>M</italic>), as well as the ribosomal fraction (<italic>R</italic>), increases with increasing growth rate&#x2014;in accordance with known growth laws of heterotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wei&#x00DF;e et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>The most abundant proteins in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells were proteins associated to photosynthesis and carbon fixation, in particular proteins related to phycobilisomes, photosystems and RuBisCO. Aside from protein complexes, the most abundant monomeric protein was the elongation factor Tu (TufA) with approximately 2 &#x2013; 3 &#x00B7; 10<sup>5</sup> copies per cell. Abundances of photosynthetic proteins were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower, similar to ribosomal and other proteins, including phosphoglycerate kinase, transketolase, PII signal transducing protein, ferredoxin-NADP reductase, D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, plastocyanin, superoxide dismutase, orange carotenoid protein, RNA polymerase, cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> and chaperonine GroEL.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> also includes several previous estimates of protein abundances. We note that a direct comparison is challenging due to differences in cultivation conditions, including type of cultivation and cultivation vessel, cultivation media, irradiance, temperature, aeration, pH and the particular <italic>Synechocystis</italic> substrain (see Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2 for further details).</p>

<title>Quantitative resource allocation in cyanobacteria</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to close a gap with respect to knowledge and interpretation of key physiological parameters of the cyanobacterial model strain <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 in dependence of light intensity and growth rate. Despite the importance of cyanobacteria as photosynthetic model organisms, as yet only few studies have addressed quantitative growth properties and resource allocation even for well characterized model strains. This scarcity of data is partially due to the fact that a quantitative experimental assessment of phototrophic growth is subject to a number of technical difficulties and standardized cultivation conditions are still missing. The diversity of culture conditions used in the literature (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2) makes a direct comparison of literature data difficult and often key parameters, such as the specific growth rate, spectral properties of the light source, vessel geometry or gas exchange rates are not reported in sufficient detail. The premise of this study was therefore to use a highly reproducible cultivation setup that enables stable culture conditions in turbidostat mode and to provide a broad characterization of physiological parameters that can be compared to reported literature values. The interpretation of data was facilitated by a coarse-grained computational model of cyanobacterial resource allocation and the date was put into the context of data obtained from a comprehensive literature research.</p>

<title>Maximal growth rates and glycogen accumulation</title>
<p>The maximal specific growth rates of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> GT-L obtained in this study were similar to the maximal growth rates of other <italic>Synechocystis</italic> substrains reported in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Touloupakis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nguyen and Rittmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Du et al., 2016</xref>). While individual <italic>Synechocystis</italic> substrains can be more sensitive to high light, the correspondence with reported values suggests an upper limit of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> growth in standard BG-11 medium. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">van Alphen et al. (2018)</xref> recently reported a specific growth rate of 0.16h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> (<italic>T<sub>D</sub></italic> &#x003D; 4.3h) using BG-11 medium with modified iron source and chelating agents. This finding suggests that the standard composition of BG-11 medium still induces a growth limitation, even though in our study the total concentration of iron was sufficient to fully saturate <italic>Synechocystis</italic> growth (Figure 1 - Figure supplement 1). The true growth limit of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and other strains remains an open question. We note, however, that the main goal of our study was not to maximize <italic>Synechocystis</italic> growth per se.</p>
<p>A sub-maximal specific growth rate in standard BG-11 medium might also relate to the observed increase in glycogen content with increasing light intensity and growth rate. The relative amounts of glycogen observed in this study is well within values reported in the literature (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2), and the observed upregulation of glycogen synthesis is consistent with previous findings in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). However, from the perspective of optimal resource allocation, glycogen accumulation is seemingly suboptimal, since the required energy and carbon is stored and not utilized to enhance growth. Various growth limitations are known to induce accumulation of storage products, including glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Monshupanee and Incharoensakdi, 2014</xref>), and a recent study showed that glycogen plays an important role in energy balancing and energy homeostasis in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that the observed increase in glycogen content, in the absence of other stress factors, is consistent with a limitation in standard BG-11 medium.</p>

<title>Cell morphology and variability of physiological parameters</title>
<p>Overall, the morphology and range of physiological data obtained in this study were in good agreement with previously published values for <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The cell diameter and volume were well within the range of values reported in the literature. Likewise, the photosynthetic quotient PQ was well within values reported in the literature and did not vary significantly with growth rate. The total protein content reported here (23 &#x2013; 40&#x0025; of gDW) was lower than in several previous studies.</p>
<p>As noted above, variability in physiological parameters observed in the literature (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) can often be attributed to differences in cultivation setup and experimental design. Additionally, the choice of analytical technique can affect the results, especially with respect to absolute quantification. We are aware of limitations of some of the techniques used in this work, including glycogen estimation (extracellular polymeric substances could potentially lead to overestimation of glycogen content), proteins estimation by western blotting (where bovine serum albumin, used as a protein standard, does not have to represent cyanobacterial proteins properly), DNA estimation by flow cytometry (where penetration of SYBR<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Green I solution to the cells, and potentially also SYBR<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Green I binding to RNA could both potentially differ under increasing light intensity), or phycobiliproteins determination (where proteomics analysis resulted in two times higher values than spectrophotometric analysis, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, even taken these technical limitations into account, the quantities reported here fit well into the previously reported ranges of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> physiology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Trends in physiological parameters</title>
<p>Of particular interest were the trends of physiological parameters with respect to increasing light intensities and growth rate. Almost all identified parameters showed significant changes in dependence of light intensity and growth rate, including cell size (diameter and volume), gas exchange rates, as well as glycogen, DNA and pigment content. Trends in physiological parameters were consistent with previous studies. The increase in gas exchange (O<sub>2</sub> release and basal respiration) has been observed previously. Likewise, the increase in cellular size with growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) has been reported in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cordara et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in bacteria, yeast or mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aldea et al., 2017</xref>). Light was also shown to affect DNA content (ploidy level) in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zerulla et al., 2016</xref>), however, no study of DNA content change with growth rate is available to date.</p>
<p>Reduction of light harvesting pigments under high light is well described. Interestingly, we found upregulation of chlorophyll a, phycobilins and both PSII and PSI proteins synthesis in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells in the inital part of the growth curve (i.e. between light intensities of 27.5 &#x2013; 220 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). Similar trends have been described in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2017</xref>) as well as in other cyanobacteria and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Different from most previous studies, the range of light intensities also included conditions of photoinhibition. In several parameters, in particular pigment content, we observed a characteristic &#x201C;kink&#x201D;, i.e., a sharp in- or decrease of the respective abundances. This finding emphasizes photoinhibition as a distinct growth regime and distinguishes phototrophic growth laws from their heterotrophic counterparts.</p>
<p>Our findings also emphasize the need to specify to which reference value changes are reported. Typically values in the literature are reported relative to optical density, corresponding to changes observed per cellular dry weight. If cellular composition or cell size changes, however, these changes do not necessarily translate into corresponding changes per cell or per protein.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Proteome allocation with growth rate</title>
<p>Beyond physiological parameters, we followed the global proteome allocation as a function of growth rate. The most pronounced changes in proteome with increasing light and growth rate were related to upregulation of translational proteins and downregulation of photosynthetic proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The upregulation of proteins related to translation is consistent with well-established growth laws for heterotrophic growth. In particular, <italic>E. coli</italic> shows consistently increased proteome investment into translation-related proteins with increasing growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Peebo et al., 2015</xref>). Unique for photosynthetic organisms, we observed a decrease of (relative) allocation to proteins annotated with photosynthesis. This decrease is consistent with expectations for resource-allocation models. While the RbcL subunit of RuBisCo showed a slight increase with increasing growth rate, we observed no general upregulation of metabolic proteins with increasing growth rate&#x2014;an important deviation from known growth rate relations. This finding indicates that the metabolic capacity itself is sufficient for high growth rates, even under conditions where lack of light input limits faster growth. We hypothesize that the most pronounced changes with changing light intensity are observed for proteins related to translation and photosynthesis are due to the facts that (i) translation is typically limited by ribosomal capacity and the short half-life of the D1 protein that requires the cell to adjust it translational capacity at high light intensities, and (ii) overcapacity of light harvesting may induce cellular (photo-)damage. In contrast, overcapacity in the metabolic dark reaction entails few obvious detrimental consequences and therefore exhibits less pronounced changes.</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>Interpretation of results in the context of a coarsegrained computational model</title>
<p>A coarse-grained model of phototrophic growth allows us to interpret the physiological and proteomic changes in the context of (optimal) protein allocation. We emphasize that the model was not constructed to reproduce certain observed behavior &#x2013; rather it represents an independent nullhypothesis that provides information about the expected changes in proteome fractions with increasing growth rate under the assumption of (evolutionary) optimality. In line with models of heterotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Molenaar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wei&#x00DF;e et al., 2015</xref>), the model predicts a increase in allocation of ribosomal proteins as a function of growth rate. Different to heterotrophic models, however, the model also predicts a characteristic upward &#x201C;kink&#x201D; under conditions of photoinhibition. The relative proteomics data confirms this behavior, including the kink at high light intensities. The sharp upregulation of ribosomes at high light intensities in the model is due to the increased turnover of proteins subject to photodamage. As already noted in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faizi et al.,2018</xref>), the model is likely to overestimate this effect, due to the fact that within the model photodamage is exclusively related to protein turnover. We expect that in cells other repair mechanisms are active as well, resulting in a less pronounced upregulation of ribosomes and energy useage elsewhere. Indeed, the observed upregulation in the data is less pronounced than in the model simulations.</p>
<p>Likewise, the model predicts a downregulation of the light harvesting machinery with increasing light intensity and growth rates. The relative proteome allocation confirms this trend, including again the predicted &#x201C;kink&#x201D; when entering photoinhibition.</p>
<p>Finally, as for models heterotrophic growth, the model predicts an increase in the proteome fraction related to metabolic processes. The metabolic proteome fraction, in particular enzymes related to a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Knoop et al., 2013</xref>), did not exhibit such a clear upregulation with the exception of the RbcL protein (a subunit of RuBisCo) that increased in relative abundance with increasing growth rate. As noted above, discrepancies between model and observed data can be expected when other factors play a role in resource allocation, such as bet hedging.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Cyanobacteria are increasingly important as host organisms for green biotechnology, but as yet insight into proteome allocation of these organisms has been scarce. In this work, we focused on light as the only variable environmental parameter - and identified trends in key physiological parameters and proteome allocation as a function of growth rate. Light, however, is not the only factor that affects photoautotrophic growth. Further studies are required to identify growth limitation under different environmental conditions, such as limitations of growth by inorganic carbon or other macro -or micronutrients. The proposed cultivation setup and coarse-grained model provide a suitable framework and reference to facilitate such studies&#x2014;towards a predictive theory of phototrophic growth.</p>

<title>Photobioreactor</title>
<p>Growth experiments were performed in flat panel photobioreactors that were described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nedbal et al., 2008</xref>). The illumination in the photobioreactors was designed as a chessboard configuration of red and blue LEDs (red: &#x03BB;<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> &#x2248; 633 nm, &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub>/<sub>2</sub> &#x2248; 20 nm, Luxeon LXHLPD09; blue: &#x03BB;<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> &#x2248; 445 nm, &#x03BB;<sub>1</sub>/<sub>2</sub> &#x2248; 20 nm, Luxeon LXHL-PR09; all manufactured by Future Lighting Solutions, Montreal, QC, Canada). Spectral characteristics of the LEDs are shown in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>). The photobioreactor continuously measured optical density (OD) by an inbuilt densitometer and steady-state pigment fluorescence emission yield by a build-in fluorometer (both described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nedbal et al., 2008</xref>)). Dissolved O<sub>2</sub> was monitored by the InPro6800 electrode, culture temperature and pH were monitored by the InPro3253 electrode (all manufactured by Mettler-Toledo Inc., Columbus, OH, USA). Culture homogenization was secured by the inflow gas bubbling with a rate of 200 mL min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, complemented by rotations of a magnetic stirrer bar (<italic>&#x03D5;</italic>5 &#x00D7; 35 mm, 210 rpm) in a vertical plane. All other photobioreactor accessories were the same as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>).

<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>Growth characterization was performed in a quasicontinuous regime as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zav&#x0159;el et al., 2015b</xref>). Briefly, the exponentially growing <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells were maintained in a defined range of optical density (measured at 680 nm, OD<sub>680</sub>) by controlled dilution of the culture suspension with fresh BG-11 medium (turbidostat). The optical density was measured by the photobioreactor instrument base, and the OD<sub>680</sub> range was set to 0.60 &#x2013; 0.66, which corresponded to approximately 2 &#x2013; 4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Starting OD<sub>680</sub> of all cultures was 0.1 &#x2013; 0.2, which corresponded to approximately 2 &#x2013; 4 &#x00D7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Once the culture density reached OD<sub>680</sub> 0.66, the quasi-continuous cultivation setup was initiated by starting automated cultures dilution within the selected OD<sub>680</sub> range. Under each light condition, the cultures were growing for at least 24 hours. This period was long enough to reach growth stability, i.e. to acclimate the cells to the specific condition. The principal of quasi-continuous cultivation is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>During the quasi-continuous experiments, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was cultivated under red light intensities of 27.5 &#x2013; 1000 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The cultures were always supplemented with low intensity of blue light (27.5 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) in order to avoid growth limitation by complete absence of short wavelength photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Golden, 1995</xref>). Cultivation temperature was set to 32&#x00B0;C, and the experiments were performed under a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 5000 ppm in the sparging gas (secured by the Gas Mixing System GMS 150, Photon System Instruments Ltd., Brno, CZ).</p>

<title>Protein extraction and immunoblotting protein analysis</title>
<p>Protein extraction was done according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brown et al. (2008)</xref> with modifications. For each sample, 90 mL of culture suspension was withdrawn from the photobioreactor, centrifuged (4 000 &#x00D7;g, 5 min, 32&#x00B0;C), supernatants were partially discarded, and pellets were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged (20 000 &#x00D7; g, 4 min, 32&#x00B0;C), supernatants were discarded and the tubes were stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until further processing (up to 4 months). All following steps of protein isolation were performed at 4&#x00B0;C. The frozen pellets were resuspended in 0.8 mL of a protein extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 2 mM EDTA; 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 250 mM sucrose, 1&#x0025; of protease inhibitor cocktail P9599, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

The protein concentrations were quantified as relative to the lowest light intensity (27.5 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). In addition, absolute amounts of PsbA, PsaC, and RbcL proteins were estimated from standard curves prepared by serial dilutions of corresponding standard proteins.</p>

<title>Quantitative proteomics</title>
<p>Protein lysates of 5 individually grown replicate samples per group (27.5-55-110-220-440-1100 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) were prepared for mass spectrometric analysis by shortly stacking 5 &#x03BC;g proteins per sample in a 4-12&#x0025; Bis-Tris sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel (Thermo Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany) over a 4 mm running distance. Proteins were further processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Poschmann et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, gels were subjected to a silver staining protein containing bands cut out from the gel, destained, washed, reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Subsequently, proteins were digested for 16 h at 37&#x00B0;C with 0.1 &#x03BC;g trypsin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), peptides were extracted from the gel and after drying in a vacuum concentrator resuspended in 0.1&#x0025; trifluoroacetic acid. 500 ng of sobulized peptides per sample were then analyzed by a liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation Liquid Chromatography system, RSLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry. First, peptides were loaded for 10 minutes at a flow rate of 6 &#x03BC;l/min on a trap column (Acclaim PepMap100 trap column, 3 &#x03BC;m C18 particle size, 100 &#x212B; pore size, 75 &#x03BC;m inner diameter, 2 cm length, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) using 0.1 &#x0025; trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase. Subsequently, peptides were separated at 60&#x00B0;C on an analytical column (Acclaim PepMapRSLC, 2 &#x03BC;m C18 particle size, 100 &#x212B; pore size, 75 &#x03BC;m inner diameter, 25 cm length, Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using a 2 h gradient from 4 to 40&#x0025; solvent B (solvent A: 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid in water, solvent B: 0.1&#x0025; (v/v) formic acid, 84&#x0025; (v/v) acetonitrile in water).</p>
<p>Separated peptides were injected via distal coated SilicaTip emitters (New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) into a Q Exactive plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) online coupled via a nanosource electrospray interface. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent positive mode with a capillary temperature of 250&#x00B0;C and spray voltage set to 1 400 V. First, full scans were recorded in profile mode at a resolution of 70 000 over a scan range from 350 to 2 000 m/z. Ions were accumulated for a maximum of 80 ms and the target value for automatic gain control was set to 3 000 000. Second, a maximum often two- or threefold charged precursor ions were selected within a 2 m/z window using the build in quadrupole, fragmented via higher-energy collisional dissociation and fragments analyzed in the Orbitrap over a maximal scan range from 200 to 2 000 m/z at a resolution of 17 500. Here, the automatic gain control was set to 100 000 and the maximum ion time was 60 ms. For the next 100 s already fragmented precursors were excluded from further analysis.</p>

<title>Peptide and protein identification</title>
<p>For peptide and protein identification and quantification the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.6.1.0, MPI for Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany) was used with standard parameters if not otherwise stated. For database searches 3507 protein entries from the UP000001425 <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. strain PCC 6803 downloaded on the 20th of November 2017 from the UniProtKB were considered. Searches were conducted using following parameters: carbamidomethylation at cysteines as fixed and oxidation at methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modification, false discovery rate on peptide and protein level 1&#x0025;, match between runs enabled as well as label-free quantification and iBAQ, tryptic cleavage specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavage sites. A first search was conducted with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm and after recalibration by MaxQuant, 4.5 ppm precursor mass tolerances were applied. The mass tolerances for fragment spectra signals were set to 20 ppm.</p>
<p>Quantitative information for identified proteins was further processed within the Perseus framework (version 1.6.1.1, MPI for Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany). Here, only non-contaminant proteins identified with at least two different peptides were considered. Additionally, all proteins were filtered out which - in at least one group &#x2013; did not show any missing values in the label-free quantification data which then was used after log2 transformation for statistical analysis and relative protein amount comparisons between the different light intensity groups. Calculations of protein stoichiometries and comparison to quantitative protein data derived from other methods was done on absolute quantitative data based on iBAQ intensities. First, iBAQ intensities were normalized on the sum iBAQ intensities of four proteins (Q55806, P72587, P73505, Q59978) showing a small standard deviation, similar intensity range and ratio close to 1 between the mean intensities of the 27.5 and 1100 &#x03BC;mol(photons) m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> group. Second, a calibration of absolute intensities was performed using the PsaC Western blot data (mean of 104 fmol/&#x03BC;l). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vizcaino et al., 2016</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD009626.</p>

<p>For the identification of cellular resources that significantly changed with growth rate (including each single protein out of total 1356 identified proteins), we performed a Kruskal-Wallis test (Python scipy.stats module) for each resource (null hypothesis was that the median of all compared groups is equal) and did a pair-by-pair comparison of two conditions in each case. For the test we compared only those measurements with at least 3 samples.

<p>We further performed a Fisher&#x2019;s exact test to investigate which of the GO categories filtered out from the proteomics dataset are significantly associated to growth related proteins. For this test we used the GO slim categories. Therefore, we classified the 1356 proteins into growth dependent (779 proteins) and independent groups (577 proteins). The second classification criterion referred to being in one specific gene ontology group or not. The test was then performed for each GO slim category. An imbalance for one GO slim category, between the amount of growth-dependent and independent proteins, was determined as significant for a <italic>p</italic> &#x2212; <italic>value</italic> &#x003C; 0.05.</p>

<title>A coarse-grained proteome allocation model</title>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Model overview</title>
<p>The previously published model of proteome allocation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faizi et al. (2018)</xref> was extended with a growth-independent protein class Q that accounts for approximately half of the proteome. The growth-dependent proteome is comprised of transporter (T), ribosomes (R), metabolic enzymes (M) and photosynthetic units (P). A description of the modified model with all reaction rates and parameters is provided in Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1.</p>
<p>The proteome allocation model gives rise to an optimization problem. We assume that the objective of a unicellular organism is to maximize its growth rate while the proteome mass remains constant. The maximization of the cellular growth rate, for a given external condition, is achieved by re-adjusting the amount of ribosomes that are delegated to translate a specific protein. The optimization problem was solved using the APMonitor Optimization Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hedengren et al., 2014</xref>) with the steady-state optimization mode and the IPOPT (Interior Point Optimizer) solver option. The python interface was used to run the model.</p>

<title>Model parametrization and fitting</title>
<p>Model parameters were modified according to the data measured in this study. The model describes growth per cellular dry weight. Cell size only affects the estimated parameter for diffusion of inorganic carbon. For simplicity, the diffusion parameter is set constant. Parameters were as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faizi et al., 2018</xref>) with a cell diameter of approximately 2 &#x03BC;M and sourced from the primary literature. The remaining three parameters <italic>&#x03C4;</italic> (turnover rate of the photosynthetic unit), k<sub><italic>d</italic></sub> (photodamage) and <italic>&#x03C3;</italic> (effective absorption cross-section) were then fitted to the measured growth rates.
