<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Generalized linear models (GLMs) have a wide range of applications in systems neuroscience describing the encoding of stimulus and behavioral variables as well as the dynamics of single neurons. However, in any given experiment, many variables that directly impact neural activity are not observed or not modeled. Here we demonstrate, in both theory and practice, how these omitted variables can result in biased parameter estimates for the effects that are included. In three case studies, we estimate tuning functions for common experiments in motor cortex, hippocampus, and visual cortex. We find that including traditionally omitted variables changes estimates of the original parameters and that modulation originally attributed to one variable is reduced after new variables are included. In GLMs describing single-neuron dynamics, we then demonstrate how post-spike history effects can also be biased by omitted variables. Here we find that omitted variable bias can lead to mistaken conclusions about the stability of single neuron firing. Omitted variable bias can appear in any model where omitted variables modulate neural activity and the effects of the omitted variables covary with the included effects. Understanding how and to what extent omitted variable bias affects parameter estimates is likely to be important for interpreting the parameters and predictions of many neural encoding models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regression models have been widely used in systems neuroscience to explain how external stimulus and task variables as well as internal state variables may relate to observed neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kass et al., 2005</xref>). However, in many cases, the full set of variables that explain the activity of the observed neurons is not observed or is not even known. It is important to recognize that, in these cases, omitted variables can cause the parameter estimates for the effects that are included in a regression model to be biased. That is, parameter estimates for the modeled effects would be different if other, omitted variables were to be included in the model. In experiments from behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), but also in more controlled sensory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arandia-Romero et al., 2016</xref>), there is growing evidence that neural activity is affected by many more variables than are typically considered relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kandler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stringer et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, although it has received some attention in other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Greenland, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clarke, 2005</xref>), omitted variable bias, as a general problem, appears underappreciated in systems neuroscience. Here we demonstrate why systematically considering omitted variable bias may be important and examine how omitted variable bias can affect one popular framework for describing neural spiking activity &#x2013; the generalized linear model (GLM) with Poisson observations.</p>
<p>In modeling neural activity, omitted variable bias can appear in any situation where neurons are modulated by omitted variables and the omitted variables are not independent from the variables included in the model &#x2013; the ones whose effects we are trying to estimate. To give a concrete example, imagine an idealized neuron in primary motor cortex (M1) whose firing, unlike typical M1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</xref>), is not at all modulated by reach direction but, instead, is modulated by reach speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). If the average speed differs across reach directions, such a neuron will appear to be tuned to reach direction, despite not being directly affected by direction. First, fitting a typical tuning curve for reach direction, we would infer that such a neuron has a clear preferred direction and non-zero modulation depth. On the other hand, if we then fit a second model that included both reach direction and speed, we would infer that the neuron is modulated by speed alone, and it would be apparent that the original preferred direction and modulation depth estimates were biased due to the omitted variables.</p>

<p>In adding additional variables, previous studies have largely focused on the fact that including previously omitted variables improves model accuracy or the fact that neural activity is often influenced by a host of task variables. In M1, for instance, including speed improves model accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Moran and Schwartz, 1999</xref>), but the presence of many correlated motor variables (e.g. kinematics, end-point forces, muscle activity) makes it difficult to interpret how neurons represent movement overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Humphrey et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Omrani et al., 2017</xref>). Here, instead of focusing on the advantages and complexities of models with many variables, we focus on the fact that the parameters describing the original effects change as additional variables are included. The hypothetical M1 neuron above points to a more general set of questions about regression models of neural activity. How do we decide what variables to include? and What happens when we cannot or do not include variables that are relevant to the process that we are modeling?</p>
<p>Here we first evaluate the statistical problem of omitted variable bias in the canonical generalized linear model with Poisson observations. Then, as a case study, we examine how speed affects estimates of direction tuning of neurons in primary motor cortex, as well as, two other case studies where the spike counts are modeled as a function of external variables: orientation tuning in primary visual cortex (V1) and place tuning in the hippocampus (HC). In each of these case studies we find that commonly omitted variables (speed in M1, population activity in V1, and speed and heading in HC) can bias the estimated effects of commonly included variables (reach direction in M1, stimulus orientation/direction in V1, and place in HC). Across all three case studies, including the omitted variables reduces the estimated modulation due to typical tuning effects. We also illustrate how omitted variable bias can affect generalized linear models of spike dynamics where a post-spike history filter aims to describe refractoriness and bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>). The goal of these models is typically to differentiate aspects of spike dynamics that are due to the neurons own properties (e.g. membrane time constant, resting potential, after-hyper-polarization currents) from those due to input to the neuron from other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brillinger and Segundo, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Paninski, 2004</xref>). In this setting, the input to the neuron is typically not directly observed, but is approximated by stimulus or behavioral covariates, local field potential, or the activity of other neurons. Here we show that omitting the input can lead to large biases in post-spike history filters, and that including omitted variables describing the input can change the interpretation and stability of the estimated history effects.</p>
<p>GLMs have been used in many settings to disentangle the effects of multiple, possibly correlated, stimulus or task variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>) and also to model neural mechanisms such as post-spike dynamics, interactions between neurons, and coupling to local fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pillow et al., 2008</xref>). It is often argued that GLMs are advantageous because they have unique maximum likelihood estimates and can be more robust to non-spherical covariate distributions than other methods, such as spike-triggered averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Paninski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pillow, 2007</xref>). Although, these advantages shouldn&#x2019;t be dismissed, it is important to realize that GLMs are not immune to bias. Here we show how the possibility of omitted variable bias, in particular, should encourage researchers to be cautious in their interpretation of model parameters, even in cases where a GLM achieves high predictive accuracy.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Here we introduce the problem of omitted variable bias and examine differences between omitted variable bias in linear models and the canonical Poisson GLM. We then consider three tuning curve estimation problems: estimating direction tuning in primary motor cortex, place tuning in hippocampus, and orientation tuning in primary visual cortex and show how omitted variables in each of these three cases can alter parameter estimates. Finally, we consider a GLM that aims to describe the dynamics of post-spike history and show how omitted inputs can bias the estimated history effects and qualitatively change model stability.</p>

<title>Omitted Variable Bias in Linear Regression and canonical Poisson GLMs</title>
<p>When relevant variables are not included in a regression model, the estimated effects for the variables that are included can be biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Box, 1966</xref>). Omitted variable biases can cause the parameters describing the effects of the original variables to be over- or under-estimated, and model fits can change qualitatively when omitted variables are included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the problem of omitted variable bias it will be helpful to briefly review the case of multiple linear regression, where the bias can be described analytically. In the linear setting, consider the generative model
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where observations <italic>y</italic> are a linear combination of observed <italic>X</italic> and omitted <italic>X<sub>h</sub></italic> variables plus normally-distributed i.i.d. noise <italic>&#x220A;</italic>&#x007E;<italic>N</italic>(0, <italic>&#x03C3;</italic>). For simplicity, we ignore the intercept term, but in the analysis that follows it may also be considered as part of <italic>X</italic>. If we then fit the (mis-specified) model without the hidden variables using ordinary least squares (OLS) the estimated parameters will be
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic>o</italic>(<italic>&#x220A;</italic>) denotes the effect of noise. Although the noise term will disappear as more data is added <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, the bias (<italic>X<sup>T</sup>X</italic>)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> <italic>X<sup>T</sup>X<sub>h</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>h</sub></italic> will, generally, be non-zero. There will be no bias only in the cases where the omitted variables do not affect the observations (<italic>&#x03B2;<sub>h</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0) or when the omitted variables and observed variables are uncorrelated (<italic>X<sup>T</sup>X<sub>h</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0). Note that (<italic>X<sup>T</sup>X</italic>)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> <italic>X<sup>T</sup>X<sub>h</sub></italic> is the matrix of regression coefficients from using OLS to predict each of the omitted variables using the observed variables as predictors. For linear regression, the omitted variable bias thus depends on both the extent to which the omitted variables affect the observations <italic>&#x03B2;<sub>h</sub></italic> and the extent to which the omitted variables can be (linearly) predicted from the observed variables.</p>
<p>Although there is a closed-form solution for the omitted variable bias for linear regression, the generalized linear setting is not as tractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Clogg et al., 1992</xref>). We will consider the case of a canonical Poisson GLM, in particular, where
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
In the more general case, GLMs have
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn4.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
Where <italic>g</italic><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>(&#x00B7;) is the inverse link function, and <italic>y</italic> is distributed following an exponential family distribution. For a canonical GLM the log-likelihood takes the form
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn5.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where the nonlinear function <italic>G</italic>(&#x00B7;) depends on both the link function and the noise model. For canonical GLMs, this log-likelihood is concave and the maximum likelihood estimate <italic>&#x03B2;&#x0302;</italic>satisfies <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The exact form of <italic>G</italic>(&#x00B7;) will depend on the model, but for linear regression <italic>G</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is proportional to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and for canonical (log-link) Poisson regression <italic>G</italic>(&#x00B7;)&#x003D;exp(&#x00B7;).</p>
<p>Now, with omitted variables, instead of maximizing the correct log-likelihood, we maximize instead maximize
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn6.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>For the omitted variable bias in <italic>&#x03B2;&#x0302;</italic> to be 0, we need both <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> at the same value of <italic>&#x03B2;</italic>. Although, neither MLE has a closed form solution, this condition implies that, if there is no bias due to the omitted variables,
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn7.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Where <italic>G&#x2032;</italic>(&#x00B7;)is the derivative of <italic>G</italic>(&#x00B7;). For linear regression this equality reduces to the OLS form derived above, and for canonical Poisson regression we have
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn8.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>This equality is satisfied when observations are not modulated by the hidden variables <italic>X<sub>h</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>h</sub></italic> &#x003D; 0 or, more generally, when the effect of the hidden variables &#x03B4;&#x03BB; &#x003D; exp(<italic>X&#x03B2;</italic> &#x002B; <italic>X<sub>h</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>h</sub></italic>) &#x2013; exp(<italic>X&#x03B2;</italic>) is orthogonal to the included variables <italic>X</italic>. Note that with linear regression, <italic>X<sup>T</sup>X<sub>h</sub></italic>&#x003D;0 implies that the estimates will not be biased, but here this is not the case unless <italic>X<sup>T</sup>&#x03B4;&#x03BB;</italic>&#x003D;0 as well.</p>
<p>These conditions are unlikely to be met, in practice, and the maximum likelihood estimate <italic>&#x03B2;&#x0302;</italic> will typically be biased under the mis-specified model. However, this mis-specification does not just affect the maxima, but also the entire likelihood. Optimization methods, such as Newton&#x2019;s method, will typically contain omitted variable bias in each parameter updates. For canonical Poisson regression, for instance, the updates take the form
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn9.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
at iteration <italic>k</italic> where the weight matrix <italic>W</italic> is diagonal with entries <italic>W<sub>ii</sub></italic> &#x003D; <italic>&#x03BB;<sub>i</sub></italic> and (<italic>X<sup>T</sup>WX</italic>)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> is the Fisher scoring matrix (inverse Hessian of the log-likelihood) at the current estimate <italic>&#x03B2;&#x0302;</italic><sup><italic>k</italic></sup>. Since the mis-specified model will use &#x03BB; &#x003D; exp(<italic>X&#x03B2;</italic>) instead of the exp(<italic>X&#x03B2;&#x002B; X<sub>h</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>h</sub></italic>), both the weight matrix and derivatives <italic>X<sup>T</sup></italic>(<italic>y</italic> &#x2013; <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>) will be biased at each step of the optimization (except when <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The parameters of GLMs are, thus, likely to be regularly biased by omitted variables. Other properties of the MLE may also be affected. For instance, if omitted variables bias the parameters themselves we should also be cautious interpreting the parameter standard errors, since <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="317511_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. In addition, omitted variables can lead to misestimation of the variability in <italic>E</italic>[<italic>y</italic>] and dispersion <italic>var</italic>(<italic>y</italic>). If the omitted variables affect the observations, then they will generally increase the variability of <italic>E</italic>[<italic>y</italic>]. Then, unless the omitted variables are perfectly predicted by the included variables, the explained variance of the mis-specified model should be lower than that of the full model. This may, in turn, lead to overestimates of dispersion, since <italic>var</italic>(<italic>y</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>E</italic>[<italic>var</italic>(<italic>y</italic>)] &#x002B; <italic>var</italic>(<italic>E</italic>[<italic>y</italic>]) &#x003D; <italic>E</italic>[<italic>var</italic>(<italic>y</italic>)] &#x002B; <italic>var</italic>(<italic>&#x03BB;</italic>).</p>

<title>Omitted Variable Bias in Tuning Curve Estimation</title>
<p>To illustrate how omitted variable bias affects GLMs of neural spiking, not just in theory, but in practice, we consider three case studies where we fit typical tuning curve models that omit potentially relevant variables along with augmented models that include these additional variables. We first consider modeling spike counts across trials and on slow (&#x003E;100ms) timescales. Here we assess 1) the tuning of neurons in motor cortex to reach direction, with speed as a potential omitted variable, 2) the tuning of neurons in hippocampus to position, with both speed and head-direction as potential omitted variables, and 3) the tuning of neurons in visual cortex to the direction of motion of a sine-wave grating, with population activity as a potential omitted variable. In each of these cases studies, we show how the omitted variables are not independent from the commonly included variables and how neural responses are modulated by the omitted variables. These two properties, together, can lead to omitted variable biases.</p>
<p>In our first case study, we model data recorded from primary motor cortex (M1) of a macaque monkey performing a center-out, planar reaching task. In this task, speed differs systematically across reach directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), with average speed differing by as much as 35&#x00B1;3&#x0025; (for the targets at 45 and 225 deg relative to right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). To model neural responses, we first fit a traditional tuning curve model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amirikian and Georgopulos, 2000</xref>), where the predicted responses depend only on target direction. Here we use a circular, cubic B-spline basis (5 equally spaced knots) to allow for deviations from sinusoidal firing, but, in most cases, the responses of the n&#x003D;81 neurons in this experiment are well described by cosine-like tuning curves with clear modulation for reach direction. We then fit a second model that includes effects from movement speed. Here we use covariates based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Moran and Schwartz, 1999</xref>), including a linear speed effect, as well as, cosine-tuned direction-speed interactions (see Methods). This model captures the responses of individual neurons, where spike counts can increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>, top) or decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>, middle) as a function of speed, and, in some cases, speed and direction appear to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>, bottom). Together, the fact that direction and speed are not independent along with the fact that neural responses appear to be modulated by speed could lead to biased parameters estimates for the model where speed is omitted.</p>

</fig>
<p>Comparing the models with and without omitted variables we find that, averaged across the population, there are only minimal shifts in the preferred direction (3&#x00B1;2 deg) when speed is included in the traditional tuning curve model, and there do not appear to large, systematic shifts in the population distribution of PDs (Kuiper&#x2019;s test, p&#x003E;0.1). At the same time, there is substantial variability between neurons in the size of the PD-shift (circular SD 32&#x00B1;5 deg). Across the population, modulation depth (measured using the standard deviation of the tuning curve) decreases slightly on average (3&#x00B1;2&#x0025;), and the size of the modulation change also varies substantially between individual neurons (SD of changes 18&#x00B1;3&#x0025;). An example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref> (bottom), for instance, has a modulation decrease of 9&#x00B1;5&#x0025; and the preferred direction changes 4&#x00B1;9 deg when speed is included in the model (standard error from bootstrapping). Overall, &#x007E;10&#x0025; of neurons have statistically significant changes in PD, and &#x007E;14&#x0025; have significant changes in modulation (bootstrap tests <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>&#x003D;0.05, not corrected for multiple comparisons). For some individual neurons, at least, the parameters of the model without speed, thus, have clear omitted variable bias. However, since individual neurons have diverse speed dependencies, in this case, the average biases across the population are minimal.</p>
<p>When speed is included in the model, model accuracy does increase slightly (p&#x003D;0.01, one-sided paired t-test). The average cross-validated (jack-knife) pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> for the original model is 0.23&#x00B1;0.01 and for the model with speed 0.24&#x00B1;.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). However, it seems likely that in other experimental contexts the effects of omitting speed would be more pronounced. Here, the relatively small number of trials (290) and reach directions (8) limits the complexity of the models that can be used before over-fitting occurs. Additionally, since all targets were the same size and distance from the initial position, the distribution of speeds is likely less variable than for reaches between more varied targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fitts, 1954</xref>). By requiring the animal to make reaches to the same targets at different speeds, previous studies have more clearly demonstrated that responses in M1 are modulated by speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>). Here we demonstrate how this type of modulation can lead to omitted variable biases in the estimated parameters of typical tuning curve models without speed.</p>
<p>In our second case study we examine the activity of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus of a rat foraging in an open field. Here we consider to what extent the practice of omitting speed and head direction from a place field model biases estimates of a neuron&#x2019;s position tuning. As in the first case study, omitted variable bias can occur if neural activity is modulated by omitted variables and the omitted variables covary with the included variables. In the case of the hippocampus, neural activity is known to be modulated by both movement speed and head direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>), in addition to an animal&#x2019;s position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">O&#x2019;Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). Additionally, behavioral variables can be highly nonuniform across the open field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Walsh and Cummins, 1976</xref>), for instance, near and far from the walls. Together the fact that the omitted variables may covary with position and the fact that neurons appears to be modulated by the omitted variables, suggest that there may be omitted variable bias.</p>
<p>Here, in one recording during an open field foraging task we find that the average speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>) and heading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>) differ extensively as a function of position. Within a given neuron&#x2019;s place field, the distributions of speed and heading may be very different from their marginal distributions. Across the population of n&#x003D;68 place cells (selected from 117 simultaneously recorded neurons, see Methods), average in-field speed was between 80-135&#x0025; of the average overall speed (5.5cm/s), and the animal&#x2019;s heading can be either more or less variable in-field (circular SD 57-80 deg) compared to overall (75 deg).</p>
<p>As previous studies have shown, we also find that neural responses are modulated by speed and head direction. Responses due to place, speed, and heading are shown for one example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>. This neuron shows a stereotypical place-dependent response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>), but splitting the observations by speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>, top) or heading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, bottom) by quartiles/quadrants reveals that there is also tuning to these variables. The neuron appears to increase its firing with increasing speed and responds most strongly when the rat is facing the left. These dependencies are well fit by the full model where the firing rate depends, not just on position, but also on the (log-transformed) speed and the heading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3D</xref>, bottom). For the example place cell shown here, the location of the place-field does not change substantially when the omitted variables are included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E</xref>). However, the modulation (SD of the rate map) decreases by 27&#x0025;. That is, 27&#x0025; of the apparent modulation due to position when it is modeled alone, can be explained by speed and heading effects.</p>

<p>Across the population of place cells, there were no clear, systematic difference in the place field locations, but the modulation (SD of the rate map <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)) decreases by 9&#x00B1;1&#x0025; on average when speed and heading are included. Individual neurons showed substantial variability in their modulation differences (population SD 10&#x00B1;1&#x0025;). As in M1, including the omitted variables increased spike prediction accuracy &#x2013; the average cross-validated (10-fold) pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> was .29&#x00B1;.02 for the original model and .31&#x00B1;.02 for the model including speed and heading activity. This difference seems small, since there is large variability in pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> values across the population, but the average increase in pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> was 11&#x00B1;3&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>). Given that neurons appear to be modulated by speed and heading, it is unsurprising that including these variables improves model fit. However, as before, it is important to note that this modulation can lead to biases in the place field estimates for the model with only position.</p>
<p>In our third case study, we examine the activity of neurons in a more controlled sensory experiment. Here we use data recorded from primary visual cortex (V1) of an anesthetized monkey viewing oriented sine-wave gratings moving in on of 12 different directions (see Methods). In this experiment, variability in the animal&#x2019;s behavior is purposefully minimized, and, instead of considering the effect of omitting a behavioral variable, here we consider the effect of omitting a variable relating to the animal&#x2019;s internal state &#x2013; the total population activity. Several studies have previously shown that population activity alters neural responses in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Okun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arandia-Romero et al., 2016</xref>). If the distribution of population activity also varies with stimulus direction, then there is the potential for omitted variable bias.</p>
<p>Here we assess neural activity from n&#x003D;90 simultaneously recorded neurons across many (2400) repeated trials with 12 different movement directions. We find that there is high trial-to-trial variability in the population rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>), and the average firing across all neurons does differs across stimulus directions, up to &#x007E;50&#x0025;. For this recording, the most extreme differences were between the 180 deg stimulus where the average rate across the population was 3.4&#x00B1;0.1Hz and the 60 deg stimulus where the average rate was 6.3&#x00B1;0.1Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). By adding the (log-transformed) population rate as a covariate to a more typical model of direction tuning, we find that population activity may lead to omitted variable bias in models of direction tuning alone.</p>

<p>As in the case studies above, there do not appear to be any consistent or systematic effects on the preferred stimulus direction at the population level (Kuiper&#x2019;s test, p&#x003D;0.1). However, the modulation depth (measured using SD of the tuning curve) decreases substantially 15&#x00B1;2&#x0025; when population rate is included in the model, and there is again high variability across neurons (SD 20&#x00B1;2&#x0025;). In this case, model accuracy increases substantially when the omitted variable is included. The cross-validated (10-fold) pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> is .26&#x00B1;.02 for the original model and .43&#x00B1;.02 for the model including population activity, with an average increase of 164&#x00B1;31&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="317511_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Unlike in M1 where the effect of speed was highly diverse for different neurons, in this case study the effect of the population rate is largely consistent. Higher population rates are associated with higher firing rates, and, for most neurons, the effect of the population rate is stronger in the preferred direction(s), consistent with a multiplicative effect. Note that here, we do not include the neuron whose rate we are modeling in the calculation of the population rate. However, using the population rate as an omitted variable requires some interpretation. The population rate will certainly be affected by the tuning of the, relatively small, sample of neurons that we observe. If we have a disproportionate number of neurons tuned to a specific preferred direction, the population rate in those directions will be higher. This suggests that in a different recording, the covariation between the stimulus and the population rate could very likely be different. However, it appears that the omitted variable biases in this case are mostly driven by noise correlations, where neural activity is correlated on single trials even within the same stimulus condition, rather than stimulus correlations, where neural activity is correlated due to similar tuning. When we shuffle the data within each stimulus condition (removing noise correlations) the average change in the modulation depth is &#x2212;1&#x00B1;2&#x0025; (SD 18&#x00B1;3&#x0025;), and the effect of the omitted variable becomes negligible.</p>

<title>Omitted Variable Bias in the Estimation of Post-Spike History Effects</title>
<p>In addition to modeling spike counts over trials or on relatively slow (&#x003E;100ms) behavioral timescales, GLMs are also often used to describe detailed, single-trial spike dynamics on fast (&#x003C;10ms) timescales. One common covariate used in these types of models is a post-spike history effect where the probably of spiking at a given time depends on the recent history of spiking. Modeling these effects allows us to describe refractoriness, bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Paninski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>), and a whole host of other dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weber and Pillow, 2017</xref>). Conceptually, the goal of these models is to disentangle the sources of rate variation based only on observations of a neuron&#x2019;s spiking, with history effects, ideally, reflecting intrinsic biophysics. However, since the full synaptic input is typically not known with extracellular spike recordings there is potential for omitted variable biases.</p>
<p>To illustrate the potential pitfalls of omitting the input to a neuron, consider using the GLM to capture single neuron dynamics in the complete absence of external covariates
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn10.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where the rate <italic>&#x03BB;</italic> is determined by a baseline parameter <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> along with a filtered version of the neuron&#x2019;s past spiking with <italic>h<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x003D; &#x03A3;<sub><italic>&#x03C4;</italic>&#x003E;0</sub> <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>&#x03C4;</italic>)<italic>n</italic>(<italic>t</italic> &#x2013; <italic>&#x03C4;</italic>). This is a perfectly acceptable model of intrinsic dynamics, but for most spike data that we observe this isolated neuron model may not provide a realistic description of a neuron receiving thousands of time-varying synaptic inputs. If we fit this model to data where the input to the neuron did vary over time,
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn11.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
then the history filter in the first model will attempt to capture variation in spiking due to the time-varying input, in addition to any intrinsic dynamics. For example, when <italic>x<sub>h</sub></italic> is periodic, the estimated history filters of the original model will attempt to capture this periodic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A-B</xref>). Just as in the tuning curve examples above, the fact that history effects covary with the input and the fact that the input modulates the neuron&#x2019;s firing leads to omitted variable bias. When the input is omitted from the model, the biased history effects simply provide the best (maximum likelihood) explanation of the observed spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Estimated post-spike history filters can be heavily biased when the input is not included in the model. A) Here we simulate from an inhomogeneous Poisson model with sinusoidal input (no post-spike history effects). The input and spike responses from 20 trials are shown. Although there are no history effects in the generative model, a GLM with history effects that is missing the correct input covariate will use the history terms to capture the structure in the autocorrelation (C). Traces denote the estimated rate for the 20 trials shown above. When the history term is included in the model, but the input is not, the GLM can still reconstruct PSTH responses using the post-spike history alone. B) Post-spike filters for the models in (A) with 95&#x0025; confidence bands.

<p>These examples with strong, periodic input are not necessarily biologically realistic, but they make it apparent how the post-spike history can be biased by omitted input variables. In vivo, neurons instead appear to be in a high-conductance state, where membrane potential fluctuations have approximately 1/<italic>f</italic> power spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Destexhe et al., 2001</xref>, 2003). When these naturalistic input statistics are used to drive the GLM, omitted variable bias can occur, as well. Here we simulate a GLM receiving 1/<italic>f<sup>&#x03B1;</sup></italic> noise input with <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> &#x003D; 0(white noise) 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7</xref>). For white noise input, the MLE accurately recovers the simulated post-spike history filter when the input is omitted from the model, but when <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> &#x003D; 1 or 2 the estimates become increasingly biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A,C</xref>). With the full model, where the input is included as a covariate, the history is recovered accurately no matter what the input statistics are. Just as in the periodic case, however, these different input statistics alter the auto-correlation, and, when the input is omitted from the model, the maximum likelihood history filter simply aims to capture these patterns.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="317511_fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In GLMs for single-neuron dynamics, one effect of omitted variable bias is that it may lead us to misinterpret how stable a neuron&#x2019;s dynamics are. Even if the true history filter only reduces the neuron&#x2019;s firing rate following a spike (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>), the estimated filter can be biased upwards when the input is omitted. If we were to simulate the activity of this neuron based on the biased filter, the bias could cause the neuron&#x2019;s rate to diverge if the rate becomes high enough. To assess the stability of the estimated post-spike history effects quantitatively, here we make use of an quasi-renewal approximation analysis introduced in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>). Given a history filter, this approach finds an approximate transfer function describing the neuron&#x2019;s future firing rate (output) given its recent (input) firing rate (see Methods). For all estimated models, the transfer function has a stable fixed point near the neuron&#x2019;s baseline firing rate. When the true input is omitted and <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> &#x003E; 0, the estimated history filters also have an unstable fixed point where the neuron&#x2019;s firing rate will diverge if the rate exceeds this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>). Here we find that omitted variable bias leads to apparent fragility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B,D</xref>). The stable region shrinks as &#x03B1; increases, and even when the true dynamics are strictly stable (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C,D</xref>), omitted variable bias can lead us to mistakenly conclude that the neuron has fragile dynamics.</p>
<p>With most extracellular spike recordings, the synaptic input that the neuron receives is unknown. However, there may also be omitted variable bias when history effects are estimated from real data. In this case, the input to a neuron can be approximated by stimulus or behavioral variables, local field potentials, or the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pillow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gerhard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Volgushev et al., 2015</xref>). Just as in the simulations above, including or omitting these variables can then alter the estimated history effects, even though they are not as directly related to spiking as the synaptic input itself. Here we consider total population spiking activity as a proxy for synaptic input and consider how including population activity alters the history filters when compared to a model of history alone.</p>
<p>We examine two datasets: spontaneous activity from primary visual cortex of an anesthetized monkey with n&#x003D;62 simultaneously recorded neurons and activity from dorsal hippocampus of a sleeping rate with n&#x003D;39 simultaneously recorded neurons. To model population covariates we sum the spiking of all neurons, excepting the one whose spiking we aim to predict, and low-pass filter the signal (see Methods). Similar to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Okun et al., 2015</xref>), we find that, since neurons often have correlated fluctuations in their spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8A,D</xref>), the population rate is a good predictor for single neuron activity. Moreover, when we add population covariates to a GLM with post-spike history effects the history filter changes.</p>
<fig id="fig8" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 8:</label>

</fig>
<p>In the V1 dataset, the post-spike gain decreases by 7.8&#x00B1;0.5&#x0025; on average when population covariates are included, and 14.9&#x00B1;0.8&#x0025; when considering only the first 50ms after a spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8B</xref>). The effects of adding population covariates are less pronounced in the hippocampal dataset. The post-spike gain decreases by 2.5&#x00B1;0.3&#x0025; on average, and 9.5&#x00B1;1.2&#x0025; when considering only the first 50ms after the spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8E</xref>). Based on the quasi-renewal approximation, all neurons in both the V1 and hippocampal datasets have fragile transfer functions where there is a stable fixed point (near the neuron&#x2019;s average firing rate) and an unstable fixed point where the neuron&#x2019;s rate diverges if the input becomes too strong. For V1, the average upper-limit of the stable region is 80&#x00B1;3Hz for the models with history only and 143&#x00B1;7Hz for the models with population covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8C</xref>). In the hippocampal data, the average upper-limit of the stable region is 38&#x00B1;6Hz for the models with history only and 75&#x00B1;13Hz for the models with population covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8F</xref>). Each neuron is, thus, apparently, more stable after the population covariates are included.</p>
<p>As in the case studies using tuning curves, adding covariates also improves spike prediction accuracy. In the V1 dataset, the average log likelihood ratio relative to a homogeneous Poisson model is 2.2&#x00B1;0.3 bits/s for the history model and 3.3&#x00B1;0.3 bits/s for the model with population covariates. In hippocampus, the log likelihood ratio is 0.9&#x00B1;0.3 bits/s for the history model and 2.0&#x00B1;0.5 bits/s for the model with population covariates. The larger effects in V1 are likely explained by the fact that the population rate is predictive for many more neurons here than for the hippocampal data. In the hippocampus, only 26&#x0025; of the neurons have an increase of over 0.5 bits/s when the population covariates are included, compared to 85&#x0025; of neurons in V1. Altogether these results demonstrate how omitted variable bias could affect estimates of post-spike history filters in vivo. In both datasets we find that when population covariates are included in the GLM spike prediction accuracy increases, post-spike gain decreases, and apparent stability increases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have illustrated the potential for omitted variable bias in two types of commonly used GLMs for neural spiking activity: tuning curve models using spike counts across trials and models that capture single-neuron dynamics with a post-spike history filter. In each model, adding a previously omitted variable, as expected, improved spike prediction accuracy. However, what we emphasize here is that, when omitted variables were included, the estimates of the original parameters changed. For three case studies using tuning curves we found that by adding a traditionally omitted variable tuning curves showed less modulation due to the originally included variables. In models of single neuron dynamics, adding omitted variables led to decreased post-spike gain and greater apparent stability. Importantly, omitted variables can arise in GLMs in any situation where an omitted variable affects neural activity and the effect of the omitted variable is not independent of the included variables.</p>
<p>The case studies here are not unique, and many studies have described how adding additional variables to a tuning curve or single neuron model can improve prediction accuracy. In M1, in addition to movement speed, joint angles, muscle activity, end-point force, and many other variables also appear to modulate neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fetz, 1992</xref>; Kalaska, 2009). In addition to speed and head direction in the hippocampus, theta-band LFP, sharp-wave ripples, and environmental features, such as borders, appear to modulate neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hartley et al., 2014</xref>). And in V1, there is growing evidence that population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lin et al., 2015</xref>) and non-visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ghazanfar and Schroeder, 2006</xref>) modulates neural responses. In each of these systems, neural responses are affected by many, many factors. Responding to many task variables may even be functional, allowing downstream neurons to more effectively discriminate inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>). In any case, it seems clear that our models do not yet capture the full complexity of neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carandini et al., 2005</xref>). By omitting relevant variables, current models are likely to be not just less accurate but also biased.</p>
<p>Parameter bias may be problematic in and of itself. However, omitted variable bias may also have an important effect on generalization performance. As noted in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Box, 1966</xref>), in a new context, the effect of the omitted variables and the relationship between the omitted and included variables may be different. Since the parameters of the included variables are biased, this change can reduce generalization accuracy. This phenomena may explain, to some extent, why tuning models fit in one condition often do not generalize to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Graf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Oby et al., 2013</xref>). For models of single-neuron dynamics, omitted variable bias can also have a negative effect on the accuracy of simulations. Previous work has shown that simulating a GLM with post-spike filters estimated from data often results in unstable, diverging simulations. Although several methods for stabilizing these simulations have recently been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>; Hocker and Park, 2017), one, perhaps primary, reason for this instability may be that the post-spike filters are biased due to omitted synaptic input. Since estimated post-spike filters may reflect not just intrinsic neuron properties but also the statistics of the input, interpreting and comparing post-spike filters may be difficult. Different history parameters may be different due to intrinsic biophysics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tripathy et al., 2013</xref>) or due to differing input, and resolving this ambiguity will likely involve more accurately accounting for the input itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kim and Shinomoto, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The possibility of omitted variable bias does not mean that estimated parameters, predictions, and simulations from simplified model are useless, but it may mean that we need to be cautious in interpreting these models and their outputs. Previous studies have already identified several specific cases of omitted variable bias where careful interpretation is necessary. For instance, omitted common input can bias estimates of interactions between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brody, 1999</xref>), and omitted history effects can bias receptive field estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pillow and Simoncelli, 2003</xref>). In estimating peri-stimulus time histograms, omitting variables that account for trial-to-trial variation may cause biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Czanner et al., 2008</xref>) or issues with identifiability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amarasingham et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, biases due to spike sorting errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Ventura, 2009</xref>) could be framed as a result of omitting variables related to missing/excess spikes. Since we typically do not model or observe all the variables that affect neural activity, omitted variable problems are likely to be pervasive in systems neuroscience far beyond these specific cases.</p>
<p>Although we have focused on GLMs here, omitted variable bias can also affect any model. Adding input nonlinearities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">David et al., 2009</xref>), interaction effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McFarland et al., 2013</xref>), or higher-order terms to the GLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Park et al., 2013</xref>) may fix certain types of model misspecification, but any model that omits relevant variables is still likely to suffer from the same problems. This includes both machine learning methods that may provide better prediction accuracy than GLMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Benjamin et al., 2017</xref>) and single neuron models aiming to describe greater biophysical detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Herz et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike over-fitting or non-convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhao and Iyengar, 2010</xref>), omitted variable bias will generally not be resolved by including additional data or by adding regularization.</p>
<p>One approach that could potentially reduce omitted variable bias is latent variable modeling, where the effects of unknown covariates are explicitly included (constrained by simplifying assumptions). Recent work has introduced latent variables for neural activity with linear dynamics (Smith and<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kulkarni and Paninski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Paninski et al., 2010</xref>), switching dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Putzky et al., 2014</xref>), rectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Whiteway and Butts, 2017</xref>), and oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arai and Kass, 2017</xref>). And these models appear to out-perform GLMs on population data in retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vidne et al., 2012</xref>), visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Archer et al., 2014</xref>), and motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Macke et al., 2011</xref>). Inferring latent variables requires making (sometimes strong) assumptions about the nature of the variables and may require observations from multiple neurons or across multiple trials, but, by approximating some of the effects of relevant omitted variables, latent variables may reduce omitted variable bias. However, generally determining when relevant variables are omitted from a model and what those variables are is not a trivial problem.</p>
<p>There is a well-known aphorism from George EP Box that, &#x201C;All models are wrong, but some are useful.&#x201D; The lengthier version of this quip is, &#x201C;All models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind.&#x201D; GLMs are certainly useful descriptions of neural activity. They are computationally tractable, can disentangle the relative influence of multiple covariates, and often provide the core components for Bayesian decoders. Here we emphasize, however, one ubiquitous circumstance in systems neuroscience where the &#x201C;approximate nature&#x201D; of the models should be &#x201C;borne in mind.&#x201D; Namely, omitted variables can bias estimates of the included effects.</p>

<title>Neural Data</title>
<p>All data analyzed here was previously recorded and shared by other researchers through the Collaborative Research in Computation Neuroscience (CRCNS) Data Sharing Initiative (crcns.org).</p>
<p>Data from primary motor cortex is from CRCNS dataset DREAM-Stevenson_2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Walker and Kording, 2013</xref>). These data were recorded using a 100-electrode Utah array (Blackrock Microsystems, 400 mm spacing, 1.5 mm length) chronically implanted in the arm area of primary motor cortex of an adult macaque monkey. The monkey made center-out reaches in a 20&#x00D7;20cm workspace while seated in a primate chair, grasping a two-link manipulandum in the horizontal plane (arm roughly in a sagittal plane). Each trial for the center-out task began with a hold period at a center target (0.3&#x2013;0.5 s). After a go cue, subjects had 1.25 s to reach one of eight peripheral targets and then held this outer target for at least 0.2&#x2013;0.5 s. Each success was rewarded with juice, and feedback (1-2cm diam) about arm position was displayed onscreen as a circular cursor. Spike sorting was performed by manual cluster cutting using an offline sorter (Plexon, Inc) with waveforms classified as single- or multi-unit based on action potential shape and minimum ISIs greater than 1.6 ms (yielding n&#x003D;81 single units). Here we take model tuning curves using spike counts between 150ms before to 350ms after the speed reached its half-max. Average movement speed for each trial was calculated from 0-250ms after the speed reached its half-max (290 trials in total). For the details of the surgery, recording, and spike sorting see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stevenson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Hippocampal data is from CRCNS HC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mizuseki et al., 2013</xref>). Here we use recording sessions ec16.19.272 and ec014.215, where a Long-Evans rat was sleeping and foraging in a 180&#x00D7;180cm maze, respectively. For both recordings, 12-shank silicon probes (with 8 recording sites each, 20&#x03BC;m separation) were implanted in CA1 (8 shanks) and EC3-5 (4 shanks) (based on histology). Spikes were sorted automatically using KlustaKwick and then manually adjusted (Klusters) yielding 85 units for the sleep data and 117 for the open field data. For the sleep data where we model post-spike history effects, the spike trains were binned at 1ms and the recording length was 27min. Here we model all neurons with firing rates &#x003E;0.5Hz (n&#x003D;39). For the open field data where we model place tuning, spike trains were binned at 250ms and the recording length was 93min. Place cells (n&#x003D;68) were selected based on having an overall firing rate &#x003C;5Hz (to rule out interneurons), a peak firing rate &#x003E;2Hz, and a contiguous set of pixels (after smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian <italic>&#x03C3;</italic>&#x003D;8cm) of at least 200 cm<sup>2</sup> where the firing rate was above 10&#x0025; of the peak rate. For details of the surgery, recording, and spike sorting see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Diba and Buzsaki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from primary visual cortex is from CRCNS dataset PVC-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kohn and Smith, 2016</xref>). Here we use spontaneous activity, during a gray screen, (Monkey 1) and responses to drifting sine-wave gratings (Monkey 1) both from an anesthetized (Sufentanil - 4-18 microg/kg/hr) adult monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Recordings were made in parafoveal V1 (RFs within 5 degrees of the fovea) using a 96-channel multi-electrode array (Blackrock Microsystems), 400 mm electrode spacing, 1mm depth. After automatic spike sorting and manual cluster adjustment, 87 and 106 units were recorded during spontaneous activity and grating presentation, respectively. Only neurons with waveform SNR&#x003E;2 and firing rates &#x003E;1Hz were analyzed, n&#x003D;62 for spontaneous and n&#x003D;90 for grating data. For the spontaneous activity we bin spike counts at 1ms and the recording length was 20min. For the drifting grating data, we analyzed spike counts from 200ms to 1.2s after stimulus onset on each trial &#x2013; 12 directions, 2400 trials total. Gratings had a spatial frequency of 1.3 cyc/deg, temporal frequency of 6.25Hz, size of 8-10 deg (to cover receptive fields of all recorded neurons) and were presented for 1.25s with a 1.5s inter-trial interval between stimuli. For surgical, stimulus, and preprocessing details see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Smith and Kohn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>For place fields in hippocampus we use isotropic Gaussian radial basis functions <italic>f</italic>(&#x00B7;) equally spaced (30cm) on an 6&#x00D7;6 square lattice with a standard deviation of 30cm

<title>Post-spike History Simulations and Population Rate Models</title>
<p>In addition to capturing tuning curves, many studies have used GLMs to describe the dynamics of single spike trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brillinger, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Paninski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Okatan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weber and Pillow, 2017</xref>). Here, to account for post-spike history effects, we use a GLM taking the form
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn18.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
Where <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the vector of spike history covariates representing the recent history of spiking and <italic>&#x03BC;</italic> determines a baseline firing rate. Here we assume <italic>h<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>)&#x003D;&#x03A3;<sub><italic>&#x03C4;</italic>&#x003E;0</sub> <italic>f<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>&#x03C4;</italic>)<italic>n</italic>(<italic>t</italic>&#x2013;<italic>&#x03C4;</italic>), and we use neuron-specific, cubic B-spline bases <italic>f</italic>(&#x00B7;) whose knots are determined by the quantiles of each neuron&#x2019;s ISI distribution. Specifically, we choose knots spaced between 10 and 400ms (HC) or 2 and 200ms (V1), where the spacing follows equal percentile regions of the ISI distribution in that same range. This gives 6 basis functions, and coefficients <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> to capture the spike-history. To enforce refractoriness, we fix the coefficient of the fastest basis (which peaks at 0 and ends at 10ms) to be-5, leaving 5 coefficients to be estimated.</p>
<p>The population rate model simply adds covariates where, for each neuron <italic>i</italic>

<title>Stability analysis</title>
<p>Here we make use of a stability analysis proposed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gerhard et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, we use a quasi-renewal approximation of the conditional intensity by considering the effect of the most recent spike, at time <italic>t&#x2032;</italic>, and averaging over possible spike histories preceding this spike
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn20.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
Where <italic>H</italic>(<italic>t</italic> &#x2013; <italic>t&#x2032;</italic>) &#x003D; <italic>&#x03B1;f</italic>(<italic>t</italic> &#x2013; <italic>t&#x2032;</italic>) and <italic>S</italic> represents the history of spiking. By assuming that <italic>S</italic> is generated from a homogeneous Poisson process with firing rate <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>, the second term can be approximated by
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn21.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Given this approximation, we can then estimate the inter-spike interval distribution as we would for a true renewal process and the steady-state distribution of inter-spike intervals is given by
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn22.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
and the predicted steady-state firing rate is <italic>f</italic>(<italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>) &#x003D; 1/<italic>E<sub>P</sub></italic>(<italic>&#x03C4;</italic>)[<italic>&#x03C4;</italic>].</p>
<p>To assess stability, we can then examine how the predicted steady-state firing rate depends on the assumed rate of the homogeneous Poisson process <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>. In particular, when <italic>f</italic>(<italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>) &#x003D; <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>the quasi-renewal model has a fixed-point. To allow for external input, we incorporate the average effect of the covariates <italic>X</italic> into the conditional intensity approximation
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="317511_ueqn23.gif"/></alternatives></disp-formula></p>
<p>Note that, in general, adding inputs <italic>X</italic> will only change the stability of the model to the extent that these covariates change the estimate of <italic>h</italic>.</p>
