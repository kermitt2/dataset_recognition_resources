<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounders in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. Yet, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify reliable, quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how such measures of quality relate to common measures of brain structure, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding brain development in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings for 1601 T1-weighted volumes acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Expert manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures, which derived measures from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project&#x2019;s Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP). Generalized linear mixed-effects models using the automated quality measures were constructed in a training sample (n &#x003D; 1067) to: 1) identify unusable images with significant artifacts, and 2) quantify subtle artifacts in usable images. These models were then tested in an independent validation dataset (n &#x003D; 534). Results reveal that unusable images can be detected with a high degree of accuracy: a model including background kurtosis and skewness achieved an AUC of 0.95 in the training dataset and 0.94 in the independent validation dataset. While identification of subtle artifact was more challenging, an 8-parameter model achieved an AUC of 0.80 in the training dataset, and 0.92 in the validation dataset. Notably, quantitative measures of image quality were related to cortical thickness and gray matter density; measures of cortical volume were less affected by artifact. Furthermore, these quantitative measures of image quality demonstrated comparable or superior performance to estimates of motion derived from other imaging sequences acquired during the same protocol. Finally, data quality significantly altered structural brain maturation occurring during adolescent development. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain development.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In-scanner motion and other imaging artifacts are increasingly appreciated as a source of bias in neuroimaging research. To the degree that in-scanner motion impacts image quality and is also related to characteristics of interest, such as age, clinical group, or treatment condition, it has the potential to systematically confound inference. While motion has long been a well-described methodological obstacle in medical imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bellon et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Smith and Nayak, 2010</xref>), and a known confound for task-related fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Friston et al., 1996</xref>), there has been an acceleration of dedicated investigations following reports that even small amounts of in-scanner motion can bias studies of functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Power et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Satterthwaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>). Such work has reinvigorated interest regarding the potential impact of data quality on other imaging modalities, including T1-weighted neuroimaging of brain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>) and diffusion weighted imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Roalf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yendiki et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Following initial work to assess the motion&#x2019;s impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Atkinson et al., 1997</xref>), much subsequent work regarding structural imaging has focused on data quality issues driven by scanner and platform-related variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Magnotta and Friedman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Styner et al., 2002</xref>; Woodard and Carley-Spencer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">2006</xref>). However, two published studies have used unique attributes of T1-weighted images to identify useable and unusable volumes. Mortamet et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2009</xref>) introduced a quality index (Qi) that accurately identified unusable volumes (AUC=0.93) collected as part of the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pizarro et al. (2016)</xref> developed statistics based on specific artifacts such as eye motion, ringing and tissue contrast. Combined in a multivariate approach these statistics classified unusable volumes with a classification accuracy of 80&#x0025;. However, neither of these studies examined how these quality indices are related to measures of brain structure, or how quantitative indices of data quality might be used to account for biases in group level analyses of brain structure. This is particularly relevant given that measures of brain structure (including regional volumes, cortical thickness, and gray matter density) are frequently used as putative biomarkers in research on development, aging, and a myriad of neurological and psychiatric diseases.</p>
<p>Research using other modalities has typically applied the &#x201C;frame displacement&#x201D; calculated from timeseries realignment parameters to summarize motion during a scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Power et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Satterthwaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>). However, most structural imaging sequences do not provide a ready estimate of participant motion during acquisition. Recently, Tisdall and colleagues overcame this limitation by embedding volumetric navigators (T1-vNavs) in the T1-weighted volume acquisition, allowing for motion to be directly quantified in a manner akin to functional imaging time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tisdall et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reuter et al. (2015)</xref> used this T1-vNavs MPRAGE sequence to demonstrate in 12 healthy adults that motion during the T1 sequence was associated with spurious alterations of cortical thickness and cortical volume.</p>
<p>Despite the clear importance of such work, the vast majority of T1-weighted imaging sequences acquired to date lack T1-vNav technology, and thus cannot derive the quantitative assessment of motion used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reuter et al. (2015</xref>). Accordingly, three important recent studies used motion during a functional imaging sequence acquired during the same scanning session as a proxy of in-scanner motion during the structural scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>). This approach is based on the observation that participant motion tends to be highly correlated across acquisitions: individuals with high motion in one sequence tend to have high motion in other sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). All three of these studies demonstrated that higher motion during a functional sequence acquired in the same session is associated with cortical thickness, even in those scans which passed manual quality assurance procedures. Furthermore, Salvia et al. (2017) demonstrated that the confounding influence of motion inflated the apparent effects of aging. While motion during a functional sequence is the most opportune proxy for motion during a structural scan, it nonetheless has important limitations. First, the ecological validity of the proxy is likely to vary with ordering effects, amount of time between scans, and other uncontrolled variables such as patient comfort. Another limitation is that it requires the addition of a functional scan, which may not have been acquired due to timing limitations or the study-specific hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on this context, we had four related aims in the current study. First, we sought to use quantitative metrics to identify T1-weighted volumes considered unusable as determined by three expert manual raters. Second, we used these measures to quantify artifact in images considered usable by manual raters. Third, we described how quantitative metrics of T1-weighted image quality related to measures of brain structure (thickness, volume, density). Finally, we investigated the confounding impact of data quality on apparent estimates of brain development during adolescence. To accomplish these goals, we utilized summary measures of the T1-weigthed image provided by the Quality Assessment Protocol (QAP)(Shehzad et al., 2015), which is part of the Configurable Pipeline for Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bellec et al., 2017</xref>). All measures were calculated for a large sample of T1-weighted volumes acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; n &#x003D; 1601), which were independently manually rated by three trained experts. Multivariate models were constructed in a large training sample, and then tested in a completely independent validation sample. These model-based metrics were directly compared to motion as measured during functional sequences acquired in the same scanning session. Finally, limits of this approach were assessed by examining model performance in images acquired on a different scanner as part of separate study. As described in detail below, we found that measures derived directly from the T1-weighted volume provide highly reliable measures of image quality.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Approach overview</title>
<p>Our overall goal was to evaluate quantitative measures of image quality directly from structural MRI volumes, and understand how such measures relate to commonly used measures of brain structure. This process included <italic>seven</italic> discrete tasks. First, three image analysts underwent rigorous training, and then independently rated each of the 1601 T1-weighted volumes from the PNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Satterthwaite et al., 2014</xref>). Second, based on these manual ratings, we created a statistical model that sought to identify images that were unusable and should not be included in analyses of brain structure; we refer to this as the &#x201C;inclusion&#x201D; model. Third, we built a second model that could differentiate usable images with some artifact from artifact-free images, ultimately using this information to yield a continuous measure of image quality; we refer to this as the &#x201C;quantification&#x201D; model. Fourth, we related the quantitative measures of image quality to commonly used measures of brain structure from two pipelines. Fifth, we examined how data quality can bias inference in studies of adolescent brain development. Sixth, we compared this approach to proxy measures estimated from motion during functional time series acquired during the same session. Seventh, we tested the limits of our strategy, and applied our models to a new dataset acquired on a different scanner.</p>

<title>Participants and structural data acquisition</title>
<p>Imaging data included 1601 scans from the PNC. All images were acquired on the same 3T Tim Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil (Siemens: Erlangen, Germany) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Satterthwaite et al., 2014</xref>). Structural images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared, rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) Tl-weighted sequence (TR &#x003D; 1810ms; TE &#x003D; 3.51ms; T1 &#x003D; 1100ms; FoV &#x003D; 180 &#x00D7; 240mm; flip angle &#x003D; 9&#x00B0;; GRAP PA factor &#x003D; 2; BW/pixel &#x003D; 130 Hz; resolution: 0.94mm &#x00D7; 0.94mm &#x00D7; 1.0mm; Acquisition time &#x003D; 3:28). Prior to scanning, in order to acclimate participants to the MRI environment and to help subjects learn to remain still during the actual scanning session, a mock scanning session was conducted using a decommissioned MRI scanner and head coil. Mock scanning was accompanied by acoustic recordings of the noise produced by gradient coils for each scanning pulse sequence.</p>

<title>Manual rating procedure and rater training</title>
<p>Similar to prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>), all 1601 images were rated on quality using a 0-2 ordinal scale. Initial pilot testing indicated that using systems with finer categories (i.e., 4 or 5 rating classes) resulted in substantially diminished interrater reliability. In this framework, a &#x201C;0&#x201D; denoted images that suffer from gross artifacts and were considered unusable. In contrast, a &#x201C;2&#x201D; was assigned to images free from visible artifact. The intermediate &#x201C;1&#x201D; category was used for images with some artifact, but which still would be considered usable.</p>
<p>A rigorous process of training was used to ensure high inter-rater reliability (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). First, anchors and exemplars for the three quality classes were agreed upon through consensus of 5 experts, including a board-certified neuroradiologist (JES), an MR physicist (MAE), a cognitive neuroscientist (DRR), an experienced image analyst (AR), and a neuropsychiatrist (TDS). Next, two of these experts (DRR and TDS) created a larger training sample by rating 100 images independently. Initial concordance was 93&#x0025;; discrepancies were resolved through consensus, thus yielding a set of 100 images that were used to train three image analysts (KS, PV, JB) who served as the raters for the complete dataset. These three analysts were trained to &#x003E;85&#x0025; agreement in this dataset. This required two rounds of blind rating: during the first round, agreement with the expert consensus was 82&#x0025;(JB), 57&#x0025;(PV), and 82&#x0025;(KS). Following further training, each rater re-rated this set of 100 images (presented in a different order, without identifiers), and achieved an accuracy of 91&#x0025;(JB), 86&#x0025;(PV), and 94&#x0025;(KS). Having met reliability benchmarks, these three raters then independently rated all 1601 images of the PNC.</p>

<p>Rater concordance was evaluated using two measures: the weighted-&#x03BA; statistic and polychoric correlations. These two measures provide complementary information: while the weighted-&#x03BA; assesses absolute rating agreement, the polychoric correlation assesses the ordering of the ratings. Variation amongst raters were assessed using a repeated effects ANOVA model. The relationship between manual rating and demographic variables (age and sex) was evaluated with a linear mixed effects model, implemented using the &#x2018;lme4&#x2019;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) package in R. In this model and those described below, rater was modeled as a random effect to account for small but systematic differences between raters.</p>

<title>Construction of training and validation samples</title>
<p>Prior to model building, the complete collection of Tl-weighted volumes was split into training and testing samples. The use of an independent validation set allowed us to select model parameters in the training sample, and then evaluate model performance in the validation sample without concern for over-fitting. Specifically, 1,067 images were used for training, and 534 were used during validation (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). In order to maintain a similar distribution of age, sex, and manual image quality rating across the two samples, we used the &#x2018;caret&#x2019;package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>;)(see <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Quantitative metrics of structural image quality</title>
<p>We evaluated the utility of an array of quantitative imaging measures included in QAP (see <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref></bold>)(Shehzad et al., 2013). QAP version 1.0.3 utilizes FMRIB&#x2019;s Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>) for image segmentation, which enables definition and quantification of quality metrics using an image&#x2019;s gray matter, white matter, and background voxels. Steps were taken to avoid the inclusion of neck and face tissue within the image&#x2019;s background for the calculation of all background metrics as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mortamet et al., 2009</xref>). Image kurtosis and skewness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Joanes and Gill, 1998</xref>) were also calculated for each tissue class and background using tools included in the &#x2018;ANTsR&#x2019;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avants et al., 2016</xref>) and &#x2018;psych&#x2019;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Revelle, 2017</xref>) packages in R; these measures have been integrated into recently-released updates to QAP. In order to visualize the relationship between quantitative measures and manual quality rating, we plotted the mean value for each image quality metric versus the mean manual quality rating. Furthermore, we also calculated partial Spearman s correlations between manual ratings and automated metrics (while controlling for age, age squared, and sex). For these plots and analyses, we collapsed any image with at least one &#x2018;0&#x2019;rating into the &#x2018;0&#x2019;bin due to small cell size of other bins.</p>

<title>Creation of model to identify unusable images (&#x201C;Inclusion" model)</title>
<p>Next, we sought to use the quantitative measures described above in a model, termed the &#x201C;inclusion&#x201D; model, to identify unusable images. We used a logistic mixed effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>), where rater was modeled as a random effect. This model sought to identify unusable images (i.e., rated &#x201C;0&#x201D;) from usable images (i.e., rated &#x201C;1&#x201D; or &#x201C;2&#x201D;). The model was built in the training set (n &#x003D; 1067). As each image was rated three times, there were in total 3201 observations in the training dataset.</p>
<p>Model training began with a simple mass-univariate model and then added features to create a multivariate model in a forward-stepwise manner. The first (base) variable in the multivariate model was defined as the variable with the best performing receiver operator curve (ROC) as measured by area under the curve (AUC) in the mass-univariate analyses. Each additional measure was added separately to this base model, and the AUC was re-calculated. The best performing feature was selected, and this process was repeated. At each step, in order to determine whether an additional model parameter provided significantly improved classification, we calculated the Delong statistic, which tests for a significant increase in AUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">DeLong et al., 1988</xref>). Model building was terminated when no significant increase in AUC was found for any variable.</p>
<p>Performance in the training set was assessed by AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Next, the exact parameters and classification threshold criterion from the training set were applied to the validation set, and the same outcome measures were evaluated in this independent dataset. For the validation data (n &#x003D; 534), we collapsed manual ratings to derive a single label per image (rather than a label for each rater), where any image with at least one &#x2018;0&#x2019;rating was considered unusable (n &#x003D; 16 images).</p>

<title>Creation of model to identify image artifacts in usable data (&#x201C;Quantification model&#x201D;)</title>
<p>While the &#x201C;inclusion&#x201D; model identified unusable data (rated &#x201C;0&#x201D;), we next aimed to identify more subtle variations in image quality, which we call the &#x201C;quantification&#x201D; model. Identical procedures were used as described above, except that the task of the model was to differentiate images rated &#x201C;1&#x201D; and &#x201C;2&#x201D;; images rated &#x201C;0&#x201D; were not included in this analysis. The training sample for the quantification model was comprised of 1,034 images, with 269 images with some artifact (rated &#x201C;1&#x201D;). As above, to derive a single label per image in the validation dataset, we collapsed information across raters and assigned the modal manual rating.</p>
<p>Notably, while the quantification model remained a logistic mixed model, it also yielded a predicted quality value (&#x0177;) that was continuously distributed. In this model, a larger &#x0177; value (log-odds) denoted higher data quality and diminished artifact. As described below, we next compared the relationship between the continuous &#x201C;quantification&#x201D; model prediction (&#x0177;) and commonly-used morphometric measures derived from the structural image.</p>

<title>Structural image processing</title>
<p>We evaluated multiple measures including cortical volume, thickness and gray matter density. To parcellate the brain into anatomically-defined regions, we used an advanced multi-atlas labeling approach. Specifically, 24 young adult T1-weighted volumes from the OASIS data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marcus et al., 2007</xref>) that were manually labeled by Neuromorphometrics, Inc. were registered to each subject&#x2019;s T1-weighted volume using the top-performing SyN diffeomorphic registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avants et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Klein et al., 2010</xref>). These label sets were synthesized into a final parcellation using joint label fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Volume was determined for each parcel using the intersection between the parcel created and the intersection of a prior driven gray matter cortical segmentation from the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline as described below. Mean thickness and density were calculated within each parcel as described below.</p>
<p>Cortical thickness was quantified using tools included in ANTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tustison et al., 2010</xref>). To avoid registration bias and maximize sensitivity to detect regional effects that can be impacted by registration error, a custom adolescent template and tissue priors were created using data from 140 PNC participants, balanced for age and sex. Structural images were then processed and registered to this custom template using the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tustison et al., 2014</xref>). This procedure includes brain extraction, N4 bias field correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tustison et al., 2010</xref>), Atropos tissue segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avants et al., 2011b</xref>), SyN diffeomorphic registration method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avants et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Klein et al., 2010</xref>), and diffeomorphic registration-based cortical thickness (DiReCT) estimation in volumetric space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Das et al., 2009</xref>). One large-scale evaluation study has shown that this procedure for estimating cortical thickness is more sensitive to individual age and sex differences over the lifespan than FreeSurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tustison et al., 2014</xref>). However, in order to ensure that results were not specific to this processing pipeline, we also calculated regional volume and thickness using FreeSurfer v5.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fischl and Dale, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, gray matter density was calculated using Atropos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avants et al., 2011b</xref>), using an iterative segmentation procedure that is initialized using 3-class K-means segmentation. This procedure produces both a discrete 3-class hard segmentation as well as a probabilistic gray matter density map (soft segmentation) for each subject. Gray matter density was calculated within the intersection of this 3-class segmentation and the subject&#x2019;s volumetric parcellation (Gennatas, et al., under review).</p>

<title>Relationship of quality estimates to measures of brain structure</title>
<p>Initial comparisons between data quality and measurements of brain structure were completed on a global level, including mean cortical thickness, total cortical volume, and mean gray matter density. This was performed in useable images (i.e., those that did not receive a &#x201C;0&#x201D; rating by any of the three manual raters). Both mean thickness and total volume were evaluated for ANTs and FreeSurfer; density was examined using ANTs only.</p>
<p>In order to relate these global image estimates to our quantification model s outcome, a partial Spearman correlation was calculated; age, age squared, and sex were included as covariates in the calculation of these partial correlations.</p>
<p>Following this evaluation of global measures of brain structure, we examined associations between data quality and regional brain structure. Specifically, we used linear regression to examine the association between image quality as summarized by the quantification model and regional estimates of cortical thickness, cortical volume, and gray matter density calculated using the ANTs pipelines. Age, age squared, and sex were included in these regression models as covariates. Multiple comparisons were controlled for using the False Discovery Rate (FDR; q &#x003D; 0.05).</p>

<title>Impact of data quality on estimates of brain development</title>
<p>The analysis described above revealed substantial relationships between data quality and measures of brain structure. We next examined how data quality may bias estimates of brain development. Specifically, we conducted mediation analyses, to determine to what degree data quality (as summarized by the &#x0177; of the quantification model) might mediate the apparent relationship between age and brain structure. A Sobel&#x2019;s z-score (Sobel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">1982</xref>) was calculated for each cortical region for thickness, volume, and gray matter density. Sobel&#x2019;s z-score estimation was implemented in the &#x2018;bda&#x2019;package in R (Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">2015</xref>).

<title>Comparison to motion in functional scans acquired in the same session</title>
<p>Three recent reports demonstrated that motion in functional sequences acquired during the same scanning session acts as an effective proxy for structural image quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, derived T1 based quantitative metrics of image quality were then compared to head motion estimated from functional sequences acquired later during the same scanning session. These additional sequences included a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeled (PCASL) perfusion scan, two task fMRI scans (tfMRI 1 &#x0026; tfMRI 2), and one resting functional connectivity scan (rsfMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Satterthwaite et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2016</xref>). The motion in each of these sequences was summarized as the Frame Displacement (FD), estimated using the average root mean square displacement as calculated by FSL&#x2019;s MCFLIRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). As not all individuals completed all functional sequences in the PNC protocol, this analysis was restricted to 804 subjects in the training sample and 424 subjects in the validation sample for whom complete data was available. For each functional sequence, the partial Spearman correlation value between the FD of each sequence and each global measure of brain structure were calculated as above; age, age squared, and sex were included as covariates as prior. In order to compare the magnitude of these relationships with the quantification model, the absolute value of these correlations was plotted.</p>

<title>Generalizability of T1 based quantitative metrics to data acquired on a different scanner</title>
<p>In order to assess the limits of our strategy and generalizability to images acquired on different scanning hardware, we tested our models on T1-weighted volume data from another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Roalf et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, T1-weighted volumes were collected on a different 3T Tim Trio scanner, using an 8-channel head coil with the following acquisition parameters: TR &#x003D; 1680ms; TE &#x003D; 4.67ms; T1 &#x003D; 1100ms; FoV &#x003D; 180 &#x00D7; 240mm; flip angle &#x003D; 15&#x00B0;; bandwith/pixel &#x003D; 150Hz; resolution: 0.94mm &#x00D7; 0.94mm &#x00D7; 1.0mm; acquisition time &#x003D; 5:00 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Roalf et al., 2015</xref>). Instead of a large sample of youth, this study compared healthy adults and those with a family history of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Data from this study was rated by each of the same three raters as described above, and processed using identical procedures.

<title>Integrated quantitative image quality metrics are related to measures of brain structure</title>
<p>We next evaluated the degree to which quantitative measures of image quality were related to commonly used measures of brain structure. These measures included cortical thickness, cortical volume, and gray matter density; thickness and volume were evaluated for both ANTs and FreeSurfer pipelines. For most measures derived from the ANTs pipeline, the outcome of the quantification model and the average manual rating demonstrated similar correlations in training and validation samples (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref></bold>). As expected and in line with prior reports, higher quality data was associated with thicker cortex on average. Total cortical volume was less impacted by artifact, and only had a nominal relationship with manual rating in the training dataset. However, in both the training and validation dataset, gray matter density displayed a very strong relationship with both manual and quantitative measures of artifact, with higher quality being associated with higher density.</p>

<p>Partial Spearman correlations are displayed between quality metrics and measures including mean cortical thickness (CT), mean cortical volume (Vol), and mean gray matter density (GMD). Thickness and volume were calculated using both ANTs and FreeSurfer. Covariates for these correlations included age, the quadratic effect of age, and sex. In general, quantitative measures of image quality aligned well with the average manual rating. Higher data quality was associated with greater mean cortical thickness; FreeSurfer had a stronger association with data quality than ANTs. Gray matter volume was least impacted by data quality, although the impact was again more pronounced for FreeSurfer. In contrast, gray matter density showed a strong relationship with data quality, with higher quality data being associated with greater density. Multiple comparisons were corrected for using FDR.</p>

<p>To ascertain if these results were specific to the processing pipelines utilized, we reran the above analyses using the FreeSurfer software suite. (Density was not evaluated as that is not a standard output of FreeSurfer). Broadly, convergent results were revealed. However, the association between data quality and cortical thickness was substantially stronger using data from FreeSurfer in both the training and validation samples.</p>
<p>Volumetric measures derived from FreeSurfer also appeared to be substantially more sensitive to image artifact than those derived from multi-atlas labeling procedure implemented in ANTs. However, the quantification model diverged for this measure from manual ratings and was not significantly related to total cortical volume as calculated using FreeSurfer.</p>
<p>To further understand such global associations with data quality, we conducted mass-univariate analyses evaluating the relationship between data quality (as summarized by the &#x0177; from the quantification model) with regional thickness, volume, and density calculated using ANTs. For cortical thickness, of the 98 regions evaluated, there was an FDR-corrected relationship with data quality in 75&#x0025; of cortical regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref></bold>) in the training dataset and 62&#x0025; in the validation dataset (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). However, the directionality of this association was regionally heterogeneous. In sensorimotor and temporal regions, higher data quality was associated with thicker cortex. In contrast, regions including the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex, higher data quality was associated with thinner cortex.</p>
<p>Regional volume as measured by ANTs was somewhat less impacted by data quality, with only 11&#x0025; of ROIs demonstrating a significant association with image quality (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref></bold>) in the training and 15&#x0025; in the validation data set (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref></bold>). Finally, gray matter density was heavily impacted by artifact, with every region demonstrating an FDR-significant association with image quality in both the training and validation samples (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref></bold> &#x0026; <bold>E</bold>). For all regions, higher data quality was associated with higher gray matter density.</p>

<title>Data quality systematically biases estimates of structural brain development</title>
<p>Having established that data quality as measured directly from features of the T1 image is related to commonly used measures of brain structure, we next evaluated the degree to which data quality might alter inference regarding brain development in youth. This is of particular concern as age is systematically related to data quality (i.e., <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Accordingly, we conducted mediation analyses to examine the degree to which data quality might mediate the relationship between age and brain structure. As expected from regionally heterogeneous effects of data quality on cortical thickness (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref></bold>), data quality had a bidirectional bias on estimates of development (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>)</bold>. For most regions (shown in red), the relationship with data quality resulted in a masking of developmental effects, and age effects became more significant when controlling for data quality.</p>
<p>However, in several regions primarily located in cingulate cortex (shown in blue), data quality had the opposite effect, and inflated apparent developmental effects. Results were highly concordant in the training and validation datasets.</p>
<p>In contrast, data quality significantly mediated the development of gray matter density in a consistent manner across all regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><bold>Figure 9E</bold> &#x0026; <bold>F</bold></xref>). As data quality reduced gray matter density, and density increases with age, artifact in the T1-weighted volume inflated apparent associations with age, and controlling for data quality resulted in diminished significance of age effects.</p>

<title>Motion from functional sequences align variably with manual rating and quantitative measures</title>
<p>Based on prior reports that motion in functional sequences acquired in the same scanning session can provide a useful proxy of structural image quality, we compared quantitative measures of structural image quality to frame displacement from the four functional scans acquired as part of the PNC. Mean motion in each functional sequence increased as the scanning session progressed in both the training and validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><bold>Figure 10 A</bold> &#x0026; <bold>B</bold></xref>). Next, we compared these proxy measures to global measures of brain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><bold>Figure 10C</bold> &#x0026; <bold>D</bold></xref>). In general, the magnitude of the relationship between motion during each functional sequence and brain structure was similar to that of the quantification model. As might be expected, functional sequences that were collected at the end of the scanning session (and thus were farther away in time from the T1 scan) tended to have a weaker relationship with measures of brain structure. This was most obvious for the resting state sequence, which was acquired last. As noted above, quantitative measures of image quality did not align well with total cortical volume.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate that summary measures derived from a T1-weighted volume can replicate results from visual inspection with a high accuracy. These measures were comparable to proxy measures derived from functional sequences acquired in the same scanning session. Furthermore, we demonstrate that image-based measures of data quality show differential relationships to several common measures of brain structure, and systematically alter estimates of brain development in youth. However, we caution that our classifiers did not generalize across scanning platforms, emphasizing the need for additional research to identify robust automated classifiers of data quality. This effort is significantly assisted by openly shared neuroimaging datasets and tools such as the PNC and the QAP software package.</p>

<title>Manual raters can achieve a high level of concordance in a large-scale sample</title>
<p>It is increasingly recognized that data quality may be the primary confound in brain imaging studies of individual difference, lifespan development, or clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ciric et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Power et al., 2015</xref>). In-scanner motion is usually the single biggest determinant of data quality, especially in individuals who are young, elderly, or ill. While summary measures of motion can be easily derived from the realignment parameters of functional time series, motion cannot be easily estimated for most existing structural imaging data. Volumetric navigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tisdall et al., 2012</xref>) provide an extremely useful solution to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tisdall et al., 2016</xref>), but such sequences have not been used for the vast majority of already-collected imaging data, which represents a huge societal investment. Due to lack of ground truth, one of the first challenges for any study attempting to estimate image-derived measures of data quality for structural images is to create manual ratings, which are necessary to train subsequent quantitative models. This problem is quite analogous to studies of psychiatric or neurologic illness, where several clinicians evaluate information from a patient and attempt to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>With limited training utilities available, we pursued an approach analogous to established procedures for training on clinical interviews and rating scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Forbes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>). Specifically, a panel of experts originally created a small set of anchors. Notably, while we originally used a rating system with 5 levels similar to that used in one recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>), we found that even highly trained experts could not reach a high level of concordance. Accordingly, we limited the quality rating to three levels, more akin to previous efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>). A larger training set of 100 images were then rated according to these anchors by two faculty experts, and were then used to train three experienced staff members to &#x003E;85&#x0025; accuracy. After this degree of reliability was established, the full set of images was evaluated.</p>
<p>Following such training, concordance remained relatively good in both the training and validation samples. The pairwise correlation between raters was even higher, reflecting that when raters were not concordant it was usually due to a small but significant between-individual rater bias. To capture such bias in all models of data quality, a mixed-effect framework was used, where rater was modeled as a random effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Image-based summary measures accurately predict image quality</title>
<p>Having established a reliable set of manual ratings, we next derived quantitative measures of data quality using summary statistics from the structural image alone. These measures were derived from the Quality Assurance Pipeline (QAP)(Shehzad et al., 2015) included in the Configurable Pipeline for Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC)(Sikka et al., 2013). Prior studies have shown that utilizing a multivariate approach with a wide array of imaging features provides enhanced accuracy for artifact detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pizarro et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Using these measures, our first task was to identify images that were so corrupted by artifact as to be unusable. This is a common first step in any imaging study. We found that these images could be accurately identified using very few model parameters. Specifically, background skewness and background kurtosis were able to identify unusable images with an AUC of 0.95 in the training set, and an AUC of 0.94 in an independent validation dataset. These measures reflect the change in the shape of the distribution of background voxels, as artifacts introduce more high intensity voxels into the background.</p>
<p>Having identified images that are unusable we removed them from the analysis and created a model trained to differentiate images without notable artifact and useable images where some artifact was present. This model yields both a dichotomous classification and a dimensional score that could be used as a covariate in group-level analyses, akin to the use of frame displacement in fMRI studies. As anticipated, this was a more difficult task: using 8 model parameters, AUC in the training set was 0.80, with a validation AUC of 0.92. The most predictive feature in this model was Qi1, which has previously been examined as a quantitative measure of image quality in large scale studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mortamet et al., 2009</xref>). While Qi1 was the most discriminative feature, it alone produced an AUC of only 0.70. However, with of 7 additional features including skewness, kurtosis, CNR, SNR, FBER, and EFC raised model performance significantly (AUC &#x003D; 0.80). Together, results of both models demonstrate that summary measures from the structural image itself can be used to derive a quantitative estimate of data quality. This information can be used to identify and exclude unusable images, and potentially as a nuisance covariate in group-level analyses.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Measures of brain structure are differentially impacted by data quality</title>
<p>As noted above, the quantification model yielded not only a classification, but also a dimensional index of image quality. This fully continuous quality score was next related to commonly-used measures of brain structure. Previous work has shown that both cortical thickness and volume is systematically biased by in-scanner motion, whether quantified by manual rating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>), motion estimated from functional sequences acquired in the same scanning session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>), or volumetric navigators embedded in the T1 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the index of image quality derived directly from the structural image itself shows a similar relationship. Relationships between measures of brain structure and our quantitative index were nearly as strong as the associations with the average of three expert raters. Realistically, most studies will not devote the resources to training three raters to a high degree of concordance, and require each rater to examine every structural image.</p>
<p>By evaluating a broad set of structural measurements, we demonstrated that the relationship with data quality is heterogeneous, and some measures are much more sensitive to noise than others. As reported in other studies, we found that higher data quality was globally associated with thicker cortex. There was substantial variability across pipelines, and cortical thickness as measured by ANTs was less impacted by data quality than the estimates provided by FreeSurfer. Furthermore, this association had notable regional heterogeneity. In somatomotor, temporal, and many frontal regions, higher data quality was associated with greater thickness. However, in other regions within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal cortex, and cingulate cortex, higher data quality was associated with thinner estimated cortical thickness. These results are strikingly convergent with prior reports including that of Reuter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2015</xref>), where motion was measured directly from the scan using embedded volumetric navigators. It should be noted that regional heterogeneity of motion effects to some degree show correspondence with large scale functional networks (such as the fronto-parietal control network and cingulo-opercular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dosenbach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vincent et al., 2008</xref>)). Thus, regional heterogeneity in the effect of data quality on cortical thickness may masquerade as results with interpretable functional neuroanatomy.</p>
<p>Of the measures evaluated, gray matter volume was the most robust to changes in image quality. Total gray matter volume as measured using ANTs was not significantly related to image quality. However, there was evidence of a substantial effect of processing pipeline, and with gray matter volume as measured by FreeSurfer being more strongly related to data quality. Such variation may be due to the multi-atlas labelling procedure employed, which has previously been found to be highly accurate in rigorous analysis grand challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Landman and Warfield, 2012</xref>). Regardless of the pipeline used, quantitative measures of image quality were not significantly related to mean brain volume, suggesting that this approach may have differential utility depending on the primary measure of interest.</p>
<p>Beyond volume and cortical thickness, we also evaluated gray matter density, a measure of brain structure derived from image segmentation. Gray matter density is a commonly used metric in voxel-based morphometry studies, with applications to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gogtay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meijer et al., 2011</xref>). Our analyses revealed a marked impact of data quality on gray matter density. Taken together, these results emphasize that data quality as estimated directly from the structural image is associated with bias in commonly-used measures of brain structure, and suggest that FreeSurfer may be somewhat more sensitive to such noise than ANTs. Finally, we provide new data showing that gray matter density may be particularly sensitive to such bias.</p>

<title>Measures of motion from functional sequences show a variable relationship to structural image quality</title>
<p>One recently proposed approach for deriving estimates of data quality from structural images is to use motion estimated from a functional time series acquired within the same session as a proxy. Several prior reports have shown that this is a fruitful approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pardoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savalia et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrating associations between this proxy measure of data quality and both cortical thickness and volume. One clear limitation of this approach is that it requires a functional scan to be acquired in the same scanning session. We document a second limitation, which is that the relationship between data quality as estimated from the functional sequence and the structural image may vary considerably based on the order of sequence acquisition. Thus, the ASL scan acquired immediately after the T1 image in our study showed a stronger relationship to measures of brain structure, which were similar in magnitude to the manual rating and image-based quality index. However, the resting-state scan acquired at the end of our scanning session showed markedly attenuated relationships in both the training and validation datasets, most likely due to increased variation and amplitude of movement as the scanning session progressed. These data should caution investigators that proxy measures of motion from functional sequences are not uniformly informative, and that sequences acquired closer in time to the structural image are more likely to provide useful proxy data.</p>

<title>Data quality biases estimates of structural brain development in youth</title>
<p>Accurate measurement of cortical thickness, volume and gray matter density are critical to understanding typical and atypical trajectories of the developing brain. The extant literature indicates robust age-related cortical thinning, reductions in regional gray matter volumes, and increases in gray matter density in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Courchesne et al., 2000</xref>; Gennatas et al., n.d.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Giedd et al., 1999</xref>; Giedd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gogtay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jernigan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kennedy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lenroot and Giedd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pfefferbaum et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Reiss et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shaw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sowell et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2004</xref>). Moreover, there are regional-specific patterns of cortical maturation throughout development, with delayed maturation of higher-order association cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Giedd et al., 1999</xref>; Giedd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gogtay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shaw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sowell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tamnes et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, the robustness of these results is predicated upon high data quality. While most of these studies use validated methods to reduce in-scanner head motion during acquisition, few if any systematically evaluated or controlled for data quality. Importantly, several recent reports indicate significant relationships between age and in-scanner head motion in a variety of MRI protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Power et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Satterthwaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Roalf et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our findings of reduced data quality in some T1-weighted volumes were not surprising. To see if previously reported developmental trends are resilient to the negative impact of data quality we performed region-wise mediation analyses. Age-related changes in regional volume were largely resilient to data quality. However, associations between age and both cortical thickness and density were significantly altered. Age-related changes in regional cortical thickness showed bidirectional, regionally heterogeneous bias when data quality was considered. Several regions in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices showed more prominent developmental effects once T1 data quality was considered. In contrast, medial regions, such as the anterior cingulate, show less prominent associations with age after controlling for data quality. Mediation analyses of age and gray matter density indicated that not accounting for data quality results in inflated apparent developmental associations.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Despite the accuracy of our image-based index of data quality, application of this model to an external dataset acquired on a different scanner provides evidence of clear limitations. While the model trained on a single scanner retained superb performance, when faced with previously unseen data acquired in the same way from the same scanner, performance was poor for data acquired on a different scanning system. This is likely due to differences in sensitivity of the head coil, which is known to influence many measures of image intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mortamet et al., 2009</xref>); differences in the sample composition (adults vs. youth) may have contributed as well. Constructing a new model with data from the new scanner restored the classification model to excellent performance, showing that approach is effective as long as it is trained and tested upon data from the same scanner. These results therefore emphasize that our statistical models of quality indices constructed from summary statistics calculated directly from the T1 image are hardware-specific, and do not generalize across scanners. Future work should evaluate which sequence and hardware variations specifically lead to such limitations, and evaluate heterogeneity amongst scanners, coils, and software. Furthermore, the degree to which such measures could provide useful information regarding the quality of other structural imaging sequences (e.g., T2-weighted images) remains unknown. Finally, there is clear need for additional research to evaluate whether a different modeling approach (perhaps using machine learning techniques) could produce a more generalizable classifier using similar input features.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present work demonstrates that data quality can be estimated directly from structural images that lack volumetric navigators. Such image-based indices of data quality can be used to exclude unusable images in a reproducible fashion. Furthermore, these continuous measures of image quality have the potential to be used as covariates in group-level analyses of structural imaging data. The ability to derive a measure of data quality directly from the structural image obviates the need for use of proxy measures from functional sequences, which we show have heterogeneous utility based on their proximity of acquisition to the structural image in the scanning session.</p>
<p>More broadly, the present data emphasize the degree to which data quality should be appreciated as an important confound in structural imaging studies, and that this varies based on the measure and analysis pipeline used. We present data establishing that gray matter density is severely impacted by data quality. Cortical thickness is substantially impacted as well, while volume shows more attenuated relationships with image quality. Furthermore, thickness and volume estimates derived from FreeSurfer appear to be more impacted by data quality than pipelines that use ANTs.</p>
<p>Given such data, investigators are encouraged to report measures of data quality for all structural imaging studies that evaluate individual or group differences. This is particularly relevant for studies where data quality is likely to be systematically related to the primary subject-level variable of interest, such as age, clinical group status, or disease severity. We provide one such example, with results that show that data quality can systematically bias estimates of structural development during youth. While it is now common practice to report summary measures of motion and image quality for fMRI research, it is less common for studies using T1-weighted imaging. The present results underscore a need for transparent reporting of such data. We urge investigators to report associations between data quality and both subject level variables of interest (e.g., age, group) as well as the primary imaging measure evaluated.</p>
<p>As noted above, the lack of generalizability of models trained on one scanner to data acquired on a different scanner will limit groups from using the exact model generated for the PNC and described here. However, given that MRI scanners represent a substantial financial investment (of several million dollars), it is not unreasonable to anticipate that such a model might be created for data acquired on each platform, and applied to the many studies collected using that hardware. Moving forward, volumetric navigators may obviate the need for such an approach, but we anticipate that the strategy outlined here will likely prove to be useful for the massive amount of structural imaging data that has already been collected at great effort and cost.</p>
