<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated Cas proteins provide an immune-like response in many prokaryotes against extraneous nucleic acids. CRISPR-Cas systems are classified into different classes and types. Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems form multi-protein effector complexes that includes a guide RNA (crRNA) used to identify the target for destruction. Here we present crystal structures of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> Type III-A CRISPR subunits Csm2 and Csm3 and a 5.2 &#x00C5; resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of an effector subcomplex including the crRNA. The structures help to clarify the quaternary architecture of Type III-A effector complexes, as well as to provide details on crRNA binding, target RNA binding and cleavage, and intermolecular interactions essential for effector complex assembly. The structures allow a better understanding of the organization of Type III-A CRISPR effector complexes as well as highlighting the overall similarities and differences with other Class 1 effector complexes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many prokaryotes, including most archaea and many bacteria, utilize immune-like response systems to defend themselves against phages and genomic invasions. One of these adaptive systems is comprised of genomic loci formed by <underline>c</underline>lustered <underline>r</underline>egularly <underline>i</underline>nterspaced <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>p</underline>alindromic <underline>r</underline>epeats (CRISPRs) and their CRISPR associated (Cas) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Horvath &#x0026; Barrangou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Karginov &#x0026; Hannon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marraffini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marraffini &#x0026; Sontheimer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">van der Oost, Westra, Jackson, &#x0026; Wiedenheft, 2014b</xref>). Although originally CRISPR was thought to function as an antisense system targeting invading phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>), it was later shown that it can also protect against horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marraffini &#x0026; Sontheimer, 2008</xref>) and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">van der Oost et al., 2014b</xref>). CRISPR loci contain several non-adjacent direct DNA repeats separated by variable sequences, called spacers, which correspond to segments of captured viral and plasmid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jansen, van Embden, Gaastra, &#x0026; Schouls, 2002</xref>). These loci allow for immune memory against invading foreign genetic elements by integrating the foreign DNA, which is then transcribed and processed to form CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bolotin, Quinquis, Sorokin, &#x0026; Ehrlich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pourcel, Salvignol, &#x0026; Vergnaud, 2005</xref>). The crRNA, in conjunction with Cas proteins, are utilized for the identification and eventual destruction of recurrent invaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Koonin, Makarova, &#x0026; Zhang, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a wide diversity in the organization and architecture of CRISPR-Cas systems. Two main classes (Class 1 and 2) have been identified from extensive comparative analysis of both the loci and proteins associated with each system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems (Types I, III, and IV) consist of multi-protein effector complexes that function together for target surveillance and defense, whereas Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems (types II, V, and VI) have a single protein that incorporates both surveillance and defense stages into one protein, Cas9 or homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). Within Class I systems, the number of proteins involved and the general architecture of the effector complexes varies and even within each type there are differences in subunit stoichiometry. Type I systems can be subdivided into seven subtypes whereas Type III CRISPR systems are further divided into four subtypes, III-A to III-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). All Type III subtypes include the Type III-defining <italic>cas10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Makarova et al., 2011</xref>), which encodes the signature Type III Cas10 protein that is responsible for DNA target degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ramia, Spilman, et al., 2014</xref>). There are two distinct effector complexes formed within Type III subtypes, known as the Csm (Types III-A/D) and Cmr (Types III-B/C) effector complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rouillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zhang, Graham, Tello, Liu, &#x0026; White, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). While originally it was not clear whether Type III systems targeted foreign DNA or RNA for destruction, it was later shown that in Type III-A systems, both RNA and DNA can be cleaved, but utilize different active sites and in a co-transcriptional manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Samai et al., 2015</xref>). Further studies showed that both Type III-A and III-B effector complexes act as RNases and target RNA-activated DNA nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Estrella, Kuo, &#x0026; Bailey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kazlauskiene, Tamulaitis, Kostiuk, Venclovas, &#x0026; Siksnys, 2016</xref>), unifying the previously incongruent mechanisms of the Type III systems into one cohesive mechanism.</p>
<p>The S<italic>taphylococcus epidermidis</italic> RP62a CRISPR-Cas system has served as the paradigm for the Type III-A subtype. Only one CRISPR loci is encoded in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a and contains three 33-34 base pair (bp) spacers flanked by four 37 bp direct repeats (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grissa, Vergnaud, &#x0026; Pourcel, 2007</xref>). Previous studies have determined that the CRIPSR-Cas effector complex is composed of the Cas proteins Cas10, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, and Csm5 in an undetermined stoichiometry and known as the Cas10-Csm complex (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan, Samai, Maniv, Jiang, &#x0026; Marraffini, 2013</xref>). These proteins combine to form a two helical protein arrangement, known as the major and minor filaments (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) (R. H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Staals et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tamulaitis, Venclovas, &#x0026; Siksnys, 2017</xref>). The major filament is composed of multiple copies of Csm3, a RAMP (repeat-associated mysterious proteins) protein containing an RNA recognition motif (RRM) fold. The filament is capped on each end by other RAMPs, Csm4 and Csm5 (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; R. H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Staals et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">van der Oost, Westra, Jackson, &#x0026; Wiedenheft, 2014a</xref>). Csm3, in particular, has been implicated in binding the crRNA guide, as well as functioning as an endoribonuclease that acts to cleave the ssRNA target in a periodic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>). The minor filament is composed of multiple copies of Csm2, the smallest subunit in the Cas10-Csm complex. Its central function is thought to be in target strand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tamulaitis et al., 2017</xref>). The protein component stoichiometry of both the major and minor filaments is dependent on the length of the crRNA, suggesting that the crRNA can modulate the assembly of the effector complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Spilman et al., 2013</xref>; R. H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Staals et al., 2013</xref>). The final and largest component of the Cas10-Csm effector complex is the signature Type III protein Cas10, an exonuclease implicated in DNA target strand degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ramia, Tang, Cocozaki, &#x0026; Li, 2014</xref>). Thus, the Cas10-Csm complex contains two different catalytic activities, with DNA degradation achieved by Cas10 and RNA degradation accomplished by Csm3, with both guided by the crRNA.</p>

<p>Our understanding of the architecture and mechanism of Type III-A systems has been limited due to the lack of high resolution structural information on the Cas10-Csm complex and its components. Although there is a wealth of information on other CRISPR types, such as Type I, the inherent diversity in the mechanism and architecture of the CRISPR systems precludes extrapolating from one type to the other, limiting how much we can learn from one type about another. To address this limitation, we have studied the structure of the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Cas10-Csm effector complex by a combination of crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. The studies reveal the crystal structures of Csm2 and Csm3, the two most abundant subunits forming the backbone of the complex. In addition, a 5.2 &#x00C5; resolution cryo-EM structure of a subcomplex including most of the subunits and the crRNA sheds light on the overall architecture of the Cas10-Csm complex, the binding of crRNA in the complex, and the active site of Csm3. Furthermore, these structural studies help understand many of the previous biochemical observations on the mechanism of this particular CRISPR-Cas complex. Finally, there is a practical interest in understanding the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, as this gram positive bacteria are the most common of the coagulase-negative staphylococci found on the human epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Otto, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">2012</xref>) and is among the most common pathogens that lead to hospital-acquired nosocomial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Otto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">von Eiff, Peters, &#x0026; Heilmann, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>The crystal structure of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Csm2 reveals a structural organization intermediate between Type III-A and III-B molecules</title>
<p><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Csm2 (SeCsm2) was purified using a His-tag to apparent homogeneity under high salt conditions to help solubilize the purified protein <bold>(Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1A</bold>). Initial crystallization trials were performed with and without the affinity tag attached, with crystals of SeCsm2 only forming when the affinity tag was present (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>). Structural determination of SeCsm2 was accomplished by experimental Single Anomalous Dispersion (SAD) from selenomethionine-incorporated crystals (<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). The final model of SeCsm2 (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> &#x003D; 24.5&#x0025;/29.4&#x0025;) was obtained from data to 2.75 &#x00C5; and consists of residues 14-28 and 37-139 with an additional 9 residues N-terminal to the start methionine identified as the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> and <bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1C</bold>). This additional region provided essential crystal contacts in the crystal lattice (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1D</bold>). After the structure was solved, the gene annotation for <italic>csm2</italic> was updated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tatusova, Ciufo, Fedorov, O&#x2019;Neill, &#x0026; Tolstoy, 2015</xref>), showing an additional 13 residues upstream of the original starting residue. The new N-terminal region is predicted to be unstructured (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1E</bold>), which could provide similar crystal contacts to the TEV protease cleavage site found in the crystal structure. It is presently unknown whether these additional N-terminal residues are relevant to the function of SeCsm2. All residue numbers stated in this work reflect the updated annotation for the <italic>csm2</italic> gene.</p>
<p>The overall structure of SeCsm2 reveals an exclusively &#x03B1;-helical fold composed of six helices (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>) forming a compact five-helix bundle with the sixth helix, &#x03B1;<sub>4</sub>, connecting two of the helices in the bundle. The organization of the helices generally follows the established fold for the small subunits of Class 1 CRISPR effector complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Venclovas, 2016</xref>). There are two notable structural differences between the SeCsm2 structure and the only other Type III-A Csm2 crystal structure available, from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (TmCsm2; PDB: 5AN6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). The first difference occurs in the loop between the first two helices, &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>. In SeCsm2, there is an extended loop (Loop 1) consisting of 20 amino acids (residues 25-44) with the middle 8 amino acids (residues 29-36) disordered in the crystal (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1C</bold>). This is much longer than the loop in TmCsm2, which only contains 6 amino acids (residues 30-35). In SeCsm2, Loop 1 contains many positively charged residues (K29, R31, K32, K34, and K36) and a pair of negatively charged residues (D30 and E35). Secondary structure predictions show an extension of &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> into Loop 1, however these residues are not part of &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> in the crystal (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1C</bold>). This suggests that this region is more flexible than predicted and is consistent with the absence of electron density for some of this loop. However, it is possible that this highly positively charged loop could play a functional role during target strand binding. Additionally, the crystal packing reveals that Loop 1 in each molecule faces the solvent space (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1D</bold>). The second difference involves the third helix in the bundle, &#x03B1;<sub>3</sub>, which rearranges in SeCsm2 to form two helices, &#x03B1;<sub>4</sub> and &#x03B1;<sub>5</sub>, whereas it is a single helix in an unswapped monomer of TmCsm2 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Venclovas, 2016</xref>). The predicted secondary structure of SeCsm2 indicates that &#x03B1;<sub>4</sub>-&#x03B1;<sub>5</sub> should form a single helix (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1C</bold>), which would be consistent with the helix topology described for Type III-A structures. Instead, it breaks and kinks in the vicinity of residue 103. Interestingly, the occurrence of two helices at this position is more prevalent in the Type III-B small subunit, Cmr5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Venclovas, 2016</xref>). Comparison of SeCsm2 &#x03B1;<sub>4</sub>-&#x03B1;<sub>5</sub> to TmCsm2 &#x03B1;<sub>3</sub> and &#x03B1;<sub>4</sub>-&#x03B1;<sub>5</sub> from the Type III-B <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> HB8 Cmr5 structure (TtCmr5; PDB: 2ZOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sakamoto et al., 2010</xref>) shows that SeCsm2 adopts an intermediate structural conformation between the single, linear helix in TmCsm2 and the pair of near perpendicular helices in TtCmr5 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). This &#x2018;intermediate structure&#x2019; observation can be extended to the entire SeCsm2, with its relative helix orientations more similar to Type III-A small subunits, but including helix topologies reminiscent of those found in Type III-B small subunits. This suggests that the small subunits form a more diverse group of structures than previously thought.</p>

<p>SeCsm2 shows only two small positively charged electrostatic surfaces that could indicate a nucleic acid binding region (<bold>Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1F</bold>). In contrast, TtCmr5 exhibits a large positively charged electrostatic surface that has been implicated in target nucleic acid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Venclovas, 2016</xref>). When SeCsm2 and TtCmr5 are aligned, the positive patches are situated in different regions of the molecules, which may suggest alternate structural organizations of effector complex minor filaments. Additionally, a positively charged surface in the TmCsm2 dimer has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>), although it is not clear that the dimer represents a biologically relevant conformation. The structure of SeCsm2 or the packing in the crystal do not suggest a nucleic acid binding mode either, making the positively charged Loop 1 in SeCsm2 a likely candidate for a loop involved in nucleic acid binding. Models for TmCsm2 and TtCmr5 forming oligomers suitable for binding to RNA have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Venclovas, 2016</xref>) and a similar model could be built using SeCsm2.</p>

<title><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Csm3 represents a minimized CRISPR backbone protein</title>
<p>Purification of nucleic acid-free <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Csm3 (SeCsm3) was challenging due to its inherent ability to bind non-specifically to nucleic acids. Apparently pure SeCsm3 was contaminated with bound nucleic acids, which formed corkscrew-like aggregates of various lengths when visualized by negative stain electron microscopy (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1A</bold>). Nucleic acid-free SeCsm3 was only produced after very slow loading onto a strong cation exchange resin and collecting the flow through of the column, which contained pure SeCsm3 (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplements 1B-C</bold>). Crystallization trials were performed on both nucleic acid-free and -bound SeCsm3, however only the nucleic acid-free protein produced high resolution diffracting crystals (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1D</bold>). Although data were collected on both native and selenomethionine (SeMet) substituted crystals, only the SeMet crystals were used in the final structure determination due to the crystals diffracting to higher resolution. Phasing using SeMet was not possible due to the weak anomalous signal, later explained by the location of many of the SeMet in disordered regions of the structure (75&#x0025; in molecule A and 50&#x0025; in molecule B) (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1E</bold>). No cysteines are present in SeCsm3, eliminating the use of selenocysteine as an alternative labeling strategy. Structure determination was ultimately accomplished by experimental SAD phasing from SeMet-SeCsm3 crystals derivatized with samarium (III) chloride. The unit cell contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2A</bold>). The final model of the SeCsm3 dimer (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> &#x003D; 23.0&#x0025;/26.7&#x0025;) was obtained from data to 2.40 &#x00C5; and consists of residues 1 to 21, 31 to 65, 74 to 124, and 137 to 214 (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1E</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). The structure is identical to a recently published crystal structure of SeCsm3 (Y. Q. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Experiments combining size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering analysis (SEC-MALS) show a molecular weight consistent with a monomer of SeCsm3 (data not shown), confirming that the dimer in the crystal is a result of crystal packing and does not reflect the oligomerization state in solution.</p>
<p>SeCsm3 consists of three distinct domains: 1) an RRM fold, 2) a &#x03B2;-hairpin, and 3) an isolated &#x03B1;-helix (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). The RRM in SeCsm3 contains five anti-parallel &#x03B2;-strands and four &#x03B1;-helices (&#x03B2;<sub>1</sub>&#x03B1;<sub>1</sub>&#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>2</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>5</sub>&#x03B1;<sub>4</sub>&#x03B1;<sub>5</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>6</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>7</sub>) with an insertion in the middle, between &#x03B2;<sub>2</sub> and &#x03B2;<sub>5</sub>, to form the &#x03B2;-hairpin (&#x03B2;<sub>4</sub> and &#x03B2;<sub>5</sub>) and the additional helix (&#x03B1;<sub>3</sub>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). As expected for a molecule that binds nucleic acids, the electrostatic potential map shows a highly positively charged region spanning &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x03B1;<sub>5</sub>, &#x03B2;<sub>2</sub>, &#x03B2;<sub>3</sub>, &#x03B2;<sub>4</sub>, and the loops surrounding them (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2B</bold>). The crystallographic dimer shows the positive patches of each monomer facing one another, partially shielding them from the solvent (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2C</bold>). The monomers of the crystallographic dimer are identical, with a relative-mean-standard-deviation (RMSD) of 0.15 &#x00C5;. To ascertain the importance of conserved regions in the protein, the sequence of SeCsm3 was compared against 150 homologous sequences using the ConSurf server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashkenazy, Erez, Martz, Pupko, &#x0026; Ben-Tal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Landau et al., 2005</xref>) and the conserved regions were analyzed. The results show an abundance of conserved residues in the positive patch of the protein and low conservation in other regions (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2D</bold>), providing further evidence that the positively charged surface corresponds to a region of functional importance.</p>

<p>SeCsm3 is known to cleave target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Samai et al., 2015</xref>) and mutating D32 abrogates this activity without impairing crRNA processing or complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Samai et al., 2015</xref>), strongly suggesting that D32 is located in the RNA cleavage active site. Mapping of D32 in the structure shows that it is found just after a disordered loop and in the vicinity of many other highly conserved residues that have been shown to be important for modulating crRNA length (H18, D100, E120, K122, E124, and R129) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Makarova et al., 2011</xref>). All these residues reside in the positive patch and many face in the same direction. Clustered together around D32 are H18, E124, R127, R137, R141, and R187. Based on sequence comparisons, H18 has been suggested to be part of the active site, although mutational studies of this residue in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> have shown no effect on effector complex formation, crRNA binding, or target cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>). Similar mutational studies of this conserved residue in other Type III Csm3 homologs have shown varied results, with no effect shown on CRISPR function in <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> Csm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>) and loss of target RNA binding in <italic>Methanopyrus kandleri</italic> Csm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hrle et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that this basic residue has lost its function in some Csm3 homologs, but kept its functionality in others. The presence of acidic amino acids D32 and E124 suggests that they could be involved in cation binding. Finally, the presence of positively charged residues, such as K122 and R129 is also consistent with a region involved in binding nucleic acids. Overall, the clustering of H18, D32, E124, R127, R137, R141 and R187, all highly conserved amino acids, strongly suggests that these amino acids are part of the active site involved in target RNA cleavage. Importantly, D100, E120, and K122, which have been shown to play a role in the regulation of crRNA length are further away and not in the vicinity of the putative active site.</p>
<p>Multiple effector backbone subunit structures have been determined for Type III-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hrle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Numata, Inanaga, Sato, &#x0026; Osawa, 2015</xref>), Type III-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Osawa, Inanaga, Sato, &#x0026; Numata, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ramia, Spilman, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhu &#x0026; Ye, 2015</xref>), Type I-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hrle et al., 2014</xref>), Type I-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lintner et al., 2011</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), and Type I-F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pausch et al., 2017</xref>) CRISPR systems, and each has shown the canonical RRM core region decorated with multiple, varying domains that may or may not play a role in its function. Type III-A Csm3 structures have been solved from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannashii</italic> (MjCsm3; PDB: 4QTS:C,D)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Numata et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Methanopyrus kandleri</italic> (MkCsm3; PDB: 4N0L)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hrle et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas the structures of SeCsm3 and MjCsm3 share the same core architecture of the RRM fold (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>), sequence identity is low, at only 38&#x0025; identity. Unfortunately, in MjCsm3, the region corresponding to the &#x03B2;-hairpin and isolated &#x03B1;-helix in SeCsm3 is disordered, preventing structural comparison of these regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). The main structural difference between SeCsm3 and MjCsm3 occurs at the C-terminus, where an insertion from E213 to E224 in MjCsm3 accounts for roughly half of the residues that form the interface with MjCsm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Numata et al., 2015</xref>). When these residues were mutated to alanine, the interaction between the two subunits was lost. As SeCsm3 does not contain this region, it suggests that an alternate interaction surface must be present between SeCsm3 and SeCsm4. In contrast to MjCsm3, the structural differences between SeCsm3 and MkCsm3 are evident (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). MkCsm3 contains a large N-terminal helical zinc-binding domain and a C-terminal helical domain that are completely absent from SeCsm3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). When comparing the electrostatic potential maps of SeCsm3 and MkCsm3, there is a dramatic shift in the orientation of the putative RNA binding surface. SeCsm3 has the binding surface at the center of the molecule, whereas the MkCsm3 binding surface is on a more proximal region, classified as the lid domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hrle et al., 2013</xref>). SeCsm3 also has a more occluded, channel-like binding region (<bold>Figure 3 - Figure supplement 2B</bold>) compared to the flattened binding region on MkCsm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hrle et al., 2013</xref>). The variation of these binding region characteristics may change how successive Csm3 subunits interact to form the backbone of the effector complex and suggest that the structure of the effector complex may show differences even amongst members of the same subtype.</p>
<p>Comparing the SeCsm3 structure to effector complex backbone subunits from other types shows a more diverged RRM architecture as well as variation in domain organization. When SeCsm3 is aligned to <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> Cas7b (SsoCas7b; PDB: 3PS0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lintner et al., 2011</xref>), the equivalent Type I-E backbone subunit, the most prominent feature is the reorganization of the &#x03B2;-hairpin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). The &#x03B2;-hairpin in SsoCas7b is flipped more than 90&#x00B0; with respect to the equivalent &#x03B2;-hairpin in SeCsm3, causing the isolated &#x03B1;-helix to be oriented almost perpendicular to the equivalent &#x03B1;-helix in SeCsm3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). In addition, SsoCas7b &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub> (corresponding to &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> in SeCsm3) is positioned such that the putative binding region of SeCsm3 would be occluded. These rearrangements relative to SeCsm3 create a more open binding surface, with the majority of the positively charged patch located around the &#x03B2;-hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lintner et al., 2011</xref>). In SsoCas7b, the additional helical domain proximal to the RRM fold as well as the C-terminal helical domain coincide surprisingly well to the respective C- and N-terminal helical domains found in MkCsm3. It is presently unknown how these rearrangements in SsoCas7b change the effector complex backbone quaternary architecture relative to the structure of the SeCsm3 major filament.</p>

<title><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Cryo-EM Structure Elucidates the Quaternary Architecture of the Major Filament Subcomplex</title>
<p>In order to study the overall architecture of the Cas10-Csm effector complex, the complex was purified directly from <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a cells using a Cas10 subunit with a His tag attached. Purification of the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> effector complex yielded a homogeneous sample where all five subunits were present and of the expected molecular weight (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). The purified effector complex was characterized both by negative stain and cryo-EM. To prevent aggregation of the complex, which caused particles to overlap in the EM grid, the salt concentration was increased from 200 mM to 500 mM NaCl (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). The high salt species still showed the presence of five subunits and isolation of the crRNA from the purified complex by phenol-chloroform extraction yielded two predominant species corresponding to pre-crRNA and mature crRNA, consistent with what was shown in previous studies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>). Negative stain EM analysis was performed to generate an initial model for cryo-EM studies (data not shown), which showed a complex of the expected shape and size. Initial analysis of the cryo-EM data showed detailed 2D class averages, with most corresponding to views where the effector complex lies with the long dimension parallel to the ice layer (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). The data showed the presence of only one particle species. A 3D density map was calculated from 107,620 particles using the negative stain model as a starting point. After post-processing steps were performed, including per-particle CTF estimation and particle polishing, the final volume had an overall resolution of 5.2 &#x00C5;, as estimated by the gold standard FSC criterion (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1A</bold>). Local resolution estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kucukelbir, Sigworth, &#x0026; Tagare, 2014</xref>) agreed with this resolution assignment (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>). The structure shows a slightly helical stem with an extended domain at the base of the molecule (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). The helical stem was clearly of higher resolution than the extended domain, whose resolution was estimated at around 7-9 &#x00C5; (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>).</p>

<caption><title>Overview of the Cryo-EM Structure of the Major Filament Subcomplex</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) A 5.2 &#x00C5; cryo-EM reconstruction of the SeCas10-Csm subcomplex shows a helical stem region adjoining the non-helical base region. The stem is formed by five SeCsm3 subunits while the base includes SeCsm4 and SeCas10. (<bold>B</bold>) SeCsm3 and a putative SeCsm4 RRM docked into the cryo-EM density map. Five SeCsm3 (alternately colored orange and yellow) and one SeCsm4 RRM (blue) were confidently placed in the density.

(<bold>C</bold>) The SeCsm3 crystal structures and the SeCsm4 RRM form a helical arrangement, with the RRM &#x03B2;-strands facing the outside of the helix and the &#x03B2;-hairpin on the inside of the helix.

<graphic xlink:href="452599_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In order to locate the positions of the SeCsm3 crystal structure in the cryo-EM map, a 6 dimensional search using Essens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kleywegt &#x0026; Jones, 1997</xref>) was done. The search identified five separate SeCsm3 locations, in addition to an RRM fold associated at the base of the backbone stem, which was assigned as SeCsm4 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref></bold>). A similar search with the crystal structure of SeCsm2 did not yield any solutions, consistent with visual inspection of the volume, and which suggests that SeCsm2 is not found in this complex. The SeCsm3 subunits accounted for most of the density in the stem, whereas the RRM fold assigned to SeCsm4 filled a small region at the base of the stem. No density corresponding to SeCsm5, which is expected to be located at one end of the stem (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) was identified in the structure. The remaining density at the base of the stem was generally assigned to SeCsm4 and SeCas10, which have been shown in other structures to interact directly (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shao et al., 2013</xref>; R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiedenheft et al., 2011</xref>) and which can be purified recombinantly as a binary complex (data not shown). The density at either end of the complex is of lower resolution and secondary structure elements are harder to discern. This could potentially be due to slightly different relative orientations between the base and stem. To address this, multi-body refinement of the base and stem as two separate bodies was performed (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1C</bold>). However, this did not improve the quality of the map (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>).</p>
<p>The SeCsm3 crystal structure fits well at five locations (labeled as SeCsm3-A to E) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Although the model accounts for most of the density around these subunits, the map shows additional density for regions that are disordered in the crystal structure, such as an extension of the incomplete &#x03B2;-hairpin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Flexible fitting of the structure using MDFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Trabuco, Villa, Mitra, Frank, &#x0026; Schulten, 2008</xref>) into the cryo-EM map showed that the crystal structure fits without major changes, aside from slight re-orientations of some of the surface loops (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1D</bold>). SeCsm3-A has the worst density, but overall it fits well. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out that the density assigned to SeCsm3-A corresponds to SeCsm5, especially if the two subunits are structurally very similar. Homology models for SeCsm4 and SeCas10 were generated, but did not fit the density adequately and were therefore not included in the final structural model. Nevertheless, the homology models served to show that the density at the base of the stem was of the shape and size to accommodate both SeCas10 and SeCsm4. A partial RRM model for SeCsm4 was built using SeCsm3 as a template. The SeCsm4 RRM lies next to SeCsm3-E in the stem and makes contacts with it (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Superposition of the MjCsm3 subunit in the MjCsm3-MjCsm4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Numata et al., 2015</xref>) on SeCsm3-E showed that SeCsm4 is positioned similarly to MjCsm4, confirming the assignment of the density to the SeCsm4 subunit. Overall, it was possible to assign density for five SeCsm3 subunits, one SeCsm4 subunit and one SeCas10 subunit (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). The SeCsm2 and SeCsm5 subunits are not present in the cryo-EM structure.</p>

</fig>
<p>After assigning density to each of the three subunits, a continuous region of unaccounted for density was located within each SeCsm3 subunit (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). This extra density was putatively assigned as the crRNA due to its shape and location (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). To support the assignment, an electrostatic potential map was calculated for the docked SeCsm3 crystal structures forming the stem. A highly positively charged channel was observed traversing the length of the stem (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). When the putative crRNA density was aligned with the electrostatic potential map, the density fit remarkably well into the positively charged channel (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref></bold>), allowing us to confidently assign this density to the crRNA. Taken together, the identification suggests that the structure corresponds to an effector subcomplex with a stoichiometry of SeCsm3<sub>5</sub>SeCsm4<sub>1</sub>SeCas10<sub>1</sub>crRNA<sub>1</sub> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref></bold>). The crRNA is of undetermined length, but given the continuous density and the fact that each SeCsm3 binds 6 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>) its length is at least 30 nucleotides long, but probably slightly longer.</p>
<p>The overall architecture of the subcomplex (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref></bold>) is similar to that of other CRISPR-Cas complexes and in agreement with the predicted overall arrangement (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). The stem is formed by five SeCsm3 subunits with the SeCas10/SeCsm4 subunits at the base of the complex and almost perpendicular to the stem (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). SeCsm4 makes clear contacts with SeCsm3-E and the crRNA seems to extend into SeCsm4. SeCas10 also appears to contact SeCsm3-E, but this is not as clear as it is not possible to assign unambiguously density to SeCsm4 and SeCas10. The crRNA runs along the positively charged groove formed by SeCsm3-A to E (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref></bold>) and appears to extend into the RRM domain of SeCsm4 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). It is not clear whether it continues into SeCas10. SeCsm5 is expected to reside on the other end of the stem next to SeCsm3-A (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>), but it is not possible to assign density for it.</p>
<p>The availability of an atomic model for the SeCsm3 stem helps locate many of the residues that have been implicated in different biochemical activities, such as forming the SeCsm3-SeCsm3 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker, Chou-Zheng, Dunkle, &#x0026; Hatoum-Aslan, 2017</xref>), crRNA binding and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatoum-Aslan, Maniv, Samai, &#x0026; Marraffini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>), target RNA binding and cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>), and protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>). Biochemical and functional studies suggest that residues H18 and D32 are involved in RNA target cleavage, residues K52, K54, R56, D100, E120, E124 and E140 affect crRNA maturation, amino acids G182, G183, and G185 have an impact on protein stability, while residues K4 and D179 form part of the SeCsm3-SeCsm3 interface (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold> and <bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplements 1A-B</bold>). Many of these residues are amongst the most highly conserved ones in the SeCsm3 backbone (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 1C</bold>) and in general can be found in or near the highly positively charged channel (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref></bold>), suggesting that their role is not confined to SeCsm3, but extends to all members of the Type III-A and possibly Type III-B subtypes. Analysis of both free SeCsm3 and SeCsm3 in the effector complex show that the four sets of residues are spatially separated from one another (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplements 1A-B</bold>). As mentioned above, many highly conserved residues involved in target cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>) cluster around H18 and D32 and form the putative active site in SeCsm3. The SeCsm3-SeCsm3 interface is extensive and the two residues biochemically identified as part of the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>) are facing each other in adjacent subunits, suggesting that K4 and D179 form a salt bridge that helps stabilize the stem in the effector complex. Residues involved in crRNA binding and maturation all cluster in the same region (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>). Three basic amino acids, K52, K54 and R56 face the region where the crRNA is located in the effector complex (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2A</bold>). D100 is near a highly conserved lysine, K122, in the adjacent subunit and it is possible that they form an inter-subunit ion pair. E140 is further away and makes an intra-subunit salt bridge with R37 (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>). Although R37 is not strictly conserved, it is either an arginine or a lysine, suggesting that the salt bridge is conserved and may play a role in stabilizing the tertiary structure of SeCsm3. E124 is also found near the interface between two subunits, but not the same subunits as for E140 and D100. Finally, the three glycines are part of a loop formed by four consecutive glycines and facing the crRNA. Overall, it is possible to classify the mutated amino acids into three large groups, those involved in making contacts at the interface between adjacent subunits, those forming part of the putative active site, and those involved in structural stability (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplements 1A-B</bold>).</p>
<p>The cRNA runs along the length of the SeCsm3 stem and travels near many conserved amino acids. Not surprisingly, the active site residues are not found abutting the crRNA density (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2A</bold>). Instead, the putative active site is found adjacent to the crRNA and facing a cavity that could easily accommodate the target RNA strand (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2B</bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The structural studies presented here describe high-resolution crystal structures of SeCsm2 and SeCsm3 and a medium resolution cryo-EM structure of a Cas10-Csm subcomplex that shows the quaternary architecture of the major filament of the complex. The structure of SeCsm2 shows a small five-helix bundle protein similar to the orthologous Cmr5 found in Type III-B CRISPR systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sakamoto et al., 2010</xref>), as well as to other Type III-A Csm2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gallo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Venclovas, 2016</xref>). However, the SeCsm2 structure shows important differences between both Type III-A and III-B Csm2 orthologs, such as the presence of a small helix that breaks a longer helix. This architecture shows SeCsm2 has some of the characteristics of other Type III-A Csm2 proteins, but also contains elements found in the Type III-B Cmr5 proteins. There are currently no known functions ascribed specifically to SeCsm2. However, other complexes have described orthologs acting to stabilize the binding of target DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hayes et al., 2016</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>) by forming a second stem parallel to the SeCsm3 stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kazlauskiene, 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Knockout studies have shown that SeCsm2 is one of the components required for crRNA maturation, but mutational studies do not implicate any of the conserved residues in this maturation role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Although the crystal structure helps understand the organization of SeCsm2, its absence in the subcomplex described here precludes any further identification of its role in the effector complex. In addition, it is not clear whether the differences observed between different Type III-A Csm2 proteins and their Type III-B orthologs may cause differences in the overall conformation of the effector complex.</p>
<p>In contrast to SeCsm2, the crystal structure for SeCsm3 provides important information on the structure and function of the subunit and how it relates to its structural and functional roles within the effector complex. SeCsm3 represents a minimized version of proteins that form the backbone in CRISPR-Cas effector complexes. Unlike other Csm3 proteins and Csm3 orthologs, SeCsm3 is formed primarily by the core RRM fold and a &#x03B2;-hairpin. The SeCms3 crystal structure shows the position of many important and highly conserved amino acids as well as the position of the putative active site responsible for RNA target cleavage suggested by mutagenesis studies to be located in the vicinity of D32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Samai et al., 2015</xref>). Aside from H18 and D32, the putative active site contains many residues normally associated with active sites of proteins involved in nucleic acid cleavage, such as arginines, lysines, and additional acidic residues. However, unlike other ribonucleases, such as ribonucleases H1 and H2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tadokoro &#x0026; Kanaya, 2009</xref>), there is no clustering of acidic residues potentially involved in cation binding. Other endoribonucleases in CRISPR systems, such as <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Cse3 (PDB: 2Y8W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sashital, Jinek, &#x0026; Doudna, 2011</xref>) and <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic> Cas6b (PDB: 4Z7K) (Y. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shao et al., 2016</xref>), show different active site locations when aligned to SeCsm3, suggesting a different mechanism of cleavage for events associated with crRNA maturation and target RNA degradation. Determining whether SeCsm3 uses a two metal cleavage mechanism or other common ribonuclease catalytic strategy remains to be elucidated and may require structures of complexes with target RNA.</p>
<p>The cryo-EM structure shows a subcomplex formed by three of the subunits, SeCsm3, SeCsm4, and SeCas10 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Neither SeCsm2 nor SeCsm5 could be located in the subcomplex. The absence of these subunits is intriguing as the purified complex showed a single migrating species in size-exclusion chromatography (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref></bold>) with all five protein components present (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref></bold>) as well as the crRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). One possible explanation for the loss of the subunits is the high salt concentration used to mitigate complex aggregation. SeCsm2 and SeCsm5 may also associate weakly in the complex without the presence of the target nucleic acid, enabling the vitrification process utilized in cryo-EM sample preparation to pull apart these components from the complex. Previous studies have shown that complex formation requires SeCsm3, SeCsm4, and SeCas10, while a subcomplex of these components forms when SeCsm2 or SeCsm5 are knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>). These subcomplexes were shown to include only the intermediate 71 nucleotide pre-crRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>), while crRNA isolated from the cryo-EM complex shows both intermediate and mature crRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). This further supports the notion that the purified complex was intact, active, and containing all subunits, as it was capable of processing pre-crRNA to the correct mature length, but lost some subunits during the vitrification process. The subcomplex in the cryo-EM structure thus represents a partial complex formed by loss of some of the subunits after formation, and not a partially assembled complex.</p>
<p>The assignment of different subunits to the density in the cryo-EM map was aided by the crystal structure of SeCsm3 as well as the presence of an RRM fold in SeCsm4. Prior studies had determined that SeCsm3 is required for proper effector complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>), with multiple copies of Csm3 forming the backbone of Type III-A complexes (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tamulaitis et al., 2017</xref>). The structure confirms this and shows that SeCsm3 does form the backbone of the effector complex and that there are five SeCsm3 copies present (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref></bold>). Although SeCsm5 is expected to cap one of the ends of the effector complex, the assignment of the density at the end of the stem as SeCsm3-A, rather than SeCsm5, was based on the presence of an RRM fold that fits well into the map, density that accounts for the entirety of SeCsm3, the existence of crRNA density within this subunit, and comparison with the cryo-EM structure of the only other Type III-A effector complex structure known, that of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> CRISPR Cas10-Csm complex (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Staals et al., 2014</xref>), which shows six subunits in the backbone stem (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 3A</bold>). At the other end of the stem, the location of SeCsm4 was aided by the presence of an RRM fold in the density. Although SeCsm3 has a similar RRM fold, the density did not fit the SeCsm3 subunit well as there were clear differences in some regions described by either additional or missing density. In support of this assignment, the structure of a Csm3-Csm4 complex from <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> showed a similar interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Numata et al., 2015</xref>). Superposition of MjCsm3 on SeCsm3 in the complex positioned MjCsm4 in the same position as SeCsm4. Finally, the position of SeCas10 was deduced from the size and shape of the unaccounted for density, as well as comparisons of other orthologous Type III-B structures published describing the association of Cas10 (Cmr2) and Csm4 (Cmr3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jung et al., 2015</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Shao et al., 2013</xref>). Given the resolution of the cryo-EM map, the boundaries between the SeCsm3, SeCsm4 and SeCas10 are not well defined, but the general organization is.</p>
<p>The resolution of the cryo-EM map is uneven; the SeCsm3 stem is the most ordered region, while the two ends are less ordered, particularly the SeCas10 region (<bold>Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1B</bold>). This observation suggests that SeCas10 is either moving or does not have a tightly held position with respect to the SeCsm3 stem. It is not clear if this difference in relative orientation is due to the absence of SeCsm2, which could play a role in stabilizing the interaction, or simply reflects the flexibility of the complex. It is possible that the conformation of SeCas10 is not rigid and thus is part of its function. During target DNA binding, SeCas10 may undergo a conformational change to help capture and orient target DNA properly in the active site.</p>
<p>The position of the crRNA in the complex follows the expected path, winding its way along the positively charged and highly conserved groove created by the SeCsm3 subunits. Previously it was found that each SeCsm3 subunit binds six nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>). The structure shows that the distance between identical residues in adjacent subunits is around 25 &#x00C5; (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2B</bold>), which is consistent with the distance spanned by six nucleotides in an extended conformation and giving a length of over 30 nucleotides for the crRNA in the complex structure. It appears that the crRNA phosphate backbone is protected by the protein, where the &#x03B2;-hairpin loop perpendicularly transverses the crRNA while the bases of the crRNA are exposed to the solvent, where it could easily interact with complementary target DNA or RNA. Residues that have been implicated in crRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker et al., 2017</xref>) are located in the vicinity (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2A</bold>). The active site location is adjacent to the crRNA and exposed and, as expected, the crRNA does not come close to the putative SeCsm3 active site (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2A</bold>). It is possible that once the crRNA recognizes and binds its target, the target strand enters the SeCsm3 active site where it can be cleaved if it is RNA. In the structure, there appears to be space to accommodate the target strand (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 2B</bold>), although it is possible that the stem has to move in a concerted fashion, as has been observed for other CRISPR-Cas effector complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The only other Type III-A effector complex structure known is a low resolution structure from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Staals et al., 2014</xref>), an organism which harbors various types and subtypes of CRISPR systems, including both Type III-A and III-B CRISPR subtypes. The Type III-A <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> complex comprises a full complex with a Cas101Csm23Csm36Csm42Csm51crRNA1 stoichiometry. Aligning the two structures shows similar major filament architectures (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 3A</bold>) even though the SeCas10-Csm structure represents a sub-complex missing SeCsm2 and SeCsm5 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Superposition of the density maps from both structures show that the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> subcomplex has a very similar overall structure to the Type III-A <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> complex (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 3A</bold>), with one major difference being the number of Csm3 and Csm4 subunits. The higher resolution cryo-EM structure of the SeCas10-Csm complex allows unambiguous assignment of the crystal structure of SeCsm3 to the cryo-EM map, where it is clear that there are only five SeCsm3 subunits. In addition, the volume also suggests the presence of only one SeCsm4 subunit. The superposition of the maps shows a similar size volume for the region assigned to one SeCsm4 and one SeCas10 as well as additional density to place one SeCsm5 at the other end of the stem. The <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> structure also suggests a path for the SeCsm2 subunits, forming a helical stem running parallel to the SeCsm3 stem. Overall, the comparison shows that the two Type III-A complexes are remarkably similar, even though the subunit stoichiometry may be different.</p>
<p>The structure of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Type III-B complex is also known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). The Type III-B effector complex has a Cmr11Cmr21Cmr31Cmr44Cmr53Cmr61crRNA1 stoichiometry (the corresponding orthologs are Cmr1:Csm3, Cmr2:Cas10, Cmr3:Csm4, Cmr4:Csm3, Cmr5:Csm2, Cmr6:Csm5). Type III-B systems are an evolutionary offshoot from the Type III-A systems, where a Cas7 family gene duplication occurred. This led to the incorporation of three Cas7 family proteins (Cmr1, Cmr4, and Cmr6) into Type III-B effector complexes, whereas only two Cas7 family proteins (Csm3 and Csm5) are found in Type III-A effector complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Makarova et al., 2011</xref>). The two subtypes have the same effector complex stoichiometry when compared by gene family, Cas101Cas51Cas76Cas113crRNA1, where the Cas5 family includes Csm4/Cmr3 and the Cas11 family includes Csm2/Cmr5. However, when the structures are compared, it is clear that they are very different in overall architecture (<bold>Figure 6 - Figure supplement 3B</bold>). While the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> effector complex has a boot-shaped overall architecture, the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Type III-B complex is much more rod-shaped and without a marked protrusion. Both complexes have in common the presence of a helical stem and a similar subunit arrangement, but overall the two complexes are quite different. The same is true when the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> complex is compared to other types, such as the Type I-E represented by the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CASCADE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mulepati, Heroux, &#x0026; Bailey, 2014</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> complex is also elongated and with a &#x2018;seahorse&#x2019; architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mulepati et al., 2014</xref>), but without any similarity in overall architecture or subunit stoichiometry. The main commonality amongst all these complexes is the presence of a helical arrangement of subunits to bind and present the crRNA. Overall, the diversity in subunit composition of the different types and subtypes is reflected in a wide array of effector complex structures, with the major commonality occurring in the arrangement of the subunits that bind the crRNA.</p>
<p>The structures presented help to understand better the overall architecture of the Type III-A Cas10-Csm effector complex. The structures help to identify the location and organization of functionally relevant residues identified by biochemical experiments, to understand the way that the Cas10-Csm complex binds the crRNA, and to detail the organization of the RNA cleavage site. This new structural information provides a structural foundation to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the function of the Type III-A CRISPR system.</p>

Filtered lysate was loaded onto nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) Superflow resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer 1 (50 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). The column was washed with 500 ml buffer 1, followed by protein elution in 10 ml fractions of elution buffer 1 (50 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). Elution fractions containing protein were dialyzed overnight at 4&#x00B0;C against 1.5 l dialysis buffer 1 (50 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl). Dialyzed protein was concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) concentrator (GE Healthcare) to 2 ml. The protein was then diluted to 100 mM NaCl immediately before loading onto a column packed with 10 ml High-S cation-exchange resin (Bio-Rad) attached to a Gilson Minipuls 3 peristaltic pump at 1.2 ml/min to reduce the likelihood of precipitation in low salt. The column was washed with 50 ml of low salt buffer (50 mM Tris pH8, 100 mM NaCl), followed by a 100 ml linear gradient from 100 mM to 1 M NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4&#x00B0;C against 1.5 l dialysis buffer 1. Finally, the protein was concentrated to 0.7-1.2 mg/ml for crystallization experiments.

The best diffracting SeCsm2 and SeMet-SeCsm2 crystals were set up at 4&#x00B0;C in VDX hanging drop vapor diffusion plates (Hampton) and grown at 10&#x00B0;C in 100 mM Tris pH7, 8&#x0025; ethanol at 1.2 mg/ml. Crystals form after 1-2 days of incubation. Crystals were cryo-protected by supplementing the crystallization condition with 20&#x0025; ethylene glycol and 10&#x0025; ethanol. SeMet-SeCsm3 crystals yielding the best diffraction data were set up at room temperature in Cryschem sitting drop vapor diffusion plates (Hampton) and grown at 14&#x00B0;C in 20&#x0025; polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 100 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH6.5, 200 mM calcium acetate at 6.8 mg/ml. Crystals form after 24 hours. SeMet-SeCsm3 crystals were cryo-protected by supplementing the crystallization condition with 20&#x0025; ethylene glycol. For heavy atom derivatization, SeMet-SeCsm3 crystals were soaked for 2 minutes in the cryo-protectant supplemented with 10 mM samarium (III) chloride before freezing.</p>

<p>X-ray diffraction data were collected from native and SeMet SeCsm2 crystals at 100 K at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, using a Rayonix MX300 CCD detector. All crystallographic data were processed with XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and Aimless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans &#x0026; Murshudov, 2013</xref>). Positions of three Se atoms were obtained with the program Shake-and-Bake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Miller et al., 1993</xref>). A Single Anomalous Dispersion (SAD) electron density map was initially obtained using SHARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">delaFortelle &#x0026; Bricogne, 1997</xref>). The map showed clearly the fold of the protein, but the data were limited to 3.2 &#x00C5; resolution. An experimental electron density map including both the SeMet data and a higher resolution native data set was calculated with SHARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">delaFortelle &#x0026; Bricogne, 1997</xref>) and was of better quality. The combined SeMet/native map allowed tracing of most of the molecule with the aid of Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emsley &#x0026; Cowtan, 2004</xref>) followed by iterative model building and refinement with BUSTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanc et al., 2004</xref>), Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams et al., 2010</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adams et al., 2011</xref>), and Refmac5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murshudov, Vagin, &#x0026; Dodson, 1997</xref>). The final model spans most of the molecule, aside from one short disordered loop (residues 29-36) and two amino acids missing at the C-terminus, and includes 9 amino acids that form part of the His-tag used for purification. The stereochemistry of the model was validated with Molprobity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emsley &#x0026; Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The final model has an R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> of 24.47&#x0025;/29.42&#x0025; to 2.75 &#x00C5; resolution with excellent stereochemistry.

<title>SeCsm3 Structure Determination</title>
<p>X-ray diffraction data were collected from SeMet-SeCsm3 crystals at 100K at LS-CAT beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, using a Dectris Eiger 9M detector. Data from SeMet crystals soaked in 10 mM samarium (III) chloride were collected with the incident beam tuned to 11.5 keV (1.0781 &#x00C5;) and 6.724 keV (1.8439 &#x00C5;). Diffraction data were processed using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and Aimless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans &#x0026; Murshudov, 2013</xref>).

The model was refined against the 1.0781 &#x00C5; data set using Refmac5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>). The final model contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit and spans most of the molecule, except for 3 disordered loops (A monomer 2-20, 32-65, 74-124, and 137-214, B monomer 0-20, 31-65, 75-124, 137-214), with an RMSD of 0.15 &#x00C5; between the two molecules. The stereochemistry of the model was validated with MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emsley &#x0026; Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The final model has an R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> of 23.1&#x0025;/26.7&#x0025; to 2.40 &#x00C5; resolution with excellent stereochemistry.

<p><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a harboring <italic>pcrispr</italic> with a Cas10 N-terminally His-tagged was generously provided by Dr. Asma Hatoum-Aslan at the University of Alabama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>). Strains were grown in BBL brain heart infusion media (BD). The media was supplemented with neomycin (15 &#x03BC;g/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 &#x03BC;g/ml). Cultures (1 l culture per 2 l flask) were grown for 24 hours at 37&#x00B0;C. Cells were harvested, frozen at -80&#x00B0;C, and stored until purification. Cell pellets from 6 l of starting culture volume were thawed at 4&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes and resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 35 &#x03BC;g/ml lysostaphin [Ambi Products]) supplemented with PMSF and benzamidine (1 mM final concentration). Cells were incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 1 hour, mixing every 20 minutes. Cell lysates were subsequently diluted 1:3 with resuspension buffer (200 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH7.4, 2 M NaCl, 80 mM imidazole, 0.4&#x0025; Triton X-100, 2 mM PMSF, 2 mM benzamidine). Sonication was performed on the diluted lysates on ice (Amplitude 25, 5 sec on, 10 sec off, 10 minute total on-time [Misonix S-4000, &#x00BD;&#x201D; horn]). Sonicated lysate was spun at 18,000 X <italic>g</italic> for 45 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C in a FA-45-6-30 fixed-angle rotor. The insoluble cell debris was removed and spun again at 18,000 X <italic>g</italic> for 30 minutes. The remaining cell debris was discarded and the clarified lysate was filtered through a 0.2 &#x03BC;m PES membrane bottle-top filter. The filtered, clarified lysate was loaded onto a column packed with Ni-NTA Superflow resin (1 ml slurry per 1 l starting culture volume) equilibrated with equilibration buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). The lysate was passed over the resin twice before washing with 600 ml wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Protein was eluted from the column with 25 ml elution buffer A (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) in 5 ml fractions. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1.5 l dialysis buffer A (20 mM Tris pH8, 200 mM NaCl) at 4&#x00B0;C overnight. Dialyzed complex was diluted to 100 mM NaCl immediately before loading onto a 10 ml column packed with Q Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris pH8, 100 mM NaCl) running at 1.4 ml/min. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer B, followed by a 100 ml linear gradient from 100 mM to 2 M NaCl. Fractions of interest were pooled and dialyzed against 1.5 l dialysis buffer B (20 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl) at 4&#x00B0;C overnight. Dialyzed complex was then concentrated to &#x007E;300 &#x03BC;l and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with dialysis buffer B. The non-aggregated complex peak was collected. Peak fractions are stored at 4&#x00B0;C for up to 1 month without any noticeable degradation as assayed by SDS-PAGE.</p>

<title>Negative Stain Electron Microscopy Sample Preparation and Data Acquisition</title>
<p>Carbon-coated copper Gilder grids (300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences [EMS]) were glow-discharged for 7 sec at 10 W in a Solarus 950 plasma cleaner (Gatan). Glow-discharged grids were placed carbon side down onto a 30 &#x03BC;l drop of 30 &#x03BC;g/ml purified complex for 5 minutes at room temperature. Grids were subsequently transferred twice to 30 &#x03BC;l drops of 20 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl for 1 minute per drop, with blotting occurring after the second transfer. The grids were then transferred twice to 30 &#x03BC;l drops of 2&#x0025; uranyl acetate solution for 30 seconds per drop, followed by blotting after the second transfer and finally allowing the grid to air dry. Once dry, the grids were imaged on a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 120 keV. 175 micrographs were collected using Leginon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Suloway et al., 2005</xref>) at a nominal magnification of 30,000x using an UltraScan4000 CCD camera with a pixel size of 3.71 &#x00C5; at the specimen level and using a defocus range of -2 &#x03BC;m to -3 &#x03BC;m.

A small group of micrographs were selected for manually picking particles for initial 2D classification and the 2D classes were used for subsequent auto-picking of the entire dataset (&#x007E;385,000 particles). Auto-picked particles were subjected to successive rounds of 2D classification to remove improperly picked particles yielding &#x007E;173,000 particles. The &#x007E;173,000 particles forming defined 2D classes were used in 3D classification. An input model was generated <italic>ab initio</italic> from a subset of these particles. The model best representing the 2D classes was chosen as the initial model for cryo-EM studies.</p>

<title>Cryo-Electron Microscopy Sample Preparation and Data Acquisition</title>
<p>Cryo-EM grids (C-flat, 1.2/1.3, 400 mesh, Cu; [EMS]) were glow-discharged for 10 sec at 15 mA in an easiGlow glow discharger (Pelco). Grids were prepared under >95&#x0025; humidity at 4&#x00B0;C using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI ThermoFisher). A glow-discharged cryo grid was placed in the Vitrobot sample chamber, onto which a 3 &#x03BC;l drop of protein (&#x007E;0.2 mg/ml) was deposited. After waiting 5 seconds, the grid was blotted for 4 seconds with a blot force of &#x002B;5 and immediately plunged into liquid ethane. The grid was transferred to a grid box for storage until data collection. Leginon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Suloway et al., 2005</xref>) was used for automated EM image collection. Micrographs were collected using a JEOL 3200FS TEM operating at 300 keV equipped with an in-column energy filter (Omega filter) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan). A nominal magnification of 30,000x was used, for a pixel size of 1.24 &#x00C5; at the specimen level and a defocus range of -2 &#x03BC;m to -3.5 &#x03BC;m. Movies were collected in counting mode with a total dose of &#x007E;37.5 e- per &#x00C5;<sup>2</sup>, fractionated into 0.2 s frames for a total of 8 s, corresponding to 40 frames per movie. A total of 1,037 movies were collected in this manner.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM Image Processing and Model Building</title>
<p>Cryo-EM movies were processed using RELION-3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nakane, Kimanius, Lindahl, &#x0026; Scheres, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). Motion correction was performed using the program MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and dose-weighted according to the relevant radiation damage curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Grant &#x0026; Grigorieff, 2015</xref>) within RELION-3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>) to allow for downstream post-processing. The Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) was estimated using CTFfind4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rohou &#x0026; Grigorieff, 2015</xref>) on motion-corrected micrographs. 277,413 particles were auto-picked from templates generated from manual 2D classification. Auto-picked particles (277,413) were subjected to 3D classification, with the best class containing 107,620 particles. Additional RELION-3.0 post processing steps included per-particle CTF estimation and particle polishing to further improve the resolution. The particle polishing step showed a significant improvement on the final calculated volume, which had a 5.2 &#x00C5; resolution according to the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rosenthal &#x0026; Henderson, 2003</xref>). Initial inspection of the map showed that the quality was uneven, with the two extremes of the molecule at lower resolution than the central stem. The map was segmented into two pieces, the major stem (5 x SeCsm3 and 1 x SeCsm4), and the rest of the volume (putatively SeCas10), to use in multi-body refinement using RELION-3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>). Multi-body refinement did not improve the resolution of the stem, but did improve slightly the volume around the SeCas10 domain.</p>
<p>To position the SeCsm3 crystal structure in the cryo-EM map, a 6 dimensional search was done using the program Essens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kleywegt &#x0026; Jones, 1997</xref>), which identified 5 copies of SeCsm3 along the stem. The positions corresponded to the same locations identified visually. Searches using SeCsm2 as a template found no matches, indicating SeCsm2 was not part of the complex. Further visual inspection of the map showed the presence of an additional RRM motif at the base of the stem. Superposition of SeCsm3 on the RRM motif showed good agreement for the RRM region, but not for other regions, suggesting that the region corresponded to an RRM-containing protein distinct from SeCsm3. This was assigned as SeCsm4. The remaining density was assigned as SeCas10 based on the position and size. No density corresponding to SeCsm5 could be identified. Once all five SeCsm3 molecules had been identified, their position was refined using jigglefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brown et al., 2015</xref>) in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emsley &#x0026; Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The models showed excellent fit in most areas, but some loops and secondary structure elements needed adjustment to fit the density. To improve the placing of the crystal structures, the monomers were fit into the map using the MDFF routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Trabuco et al., 2008</xref>) that are part of NAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). No further refinement of the models was done. Unless noted, the figures were made using the crystal structures fit into the map.</p>
