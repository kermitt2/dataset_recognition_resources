<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Storing temporal sequences of events (i.e., sequence memory) is fundamental to many cognitive functions. However, how the sequence order information is maintained and represented in working memory and its behavioral significance, particularly in human subjects, remains unknown. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with a temporal response function (TRF) method to dissociate item-specific neuronal reactivations. We demonstrate that serially remembered items are successively reactivated during memory retention. The sequential replay displays two interesting properties compared to the actual sequence. First, the item-by-item reactivation is compressed within a 200-400 ms window, suggesting that external events are associated within a plasticity-relevant window to facilitate memory consolidation. Second, the replay is in a temporally reversed order and is strongly related to the recency effect in behavior. This fast-backward replay, previously revealed in rat hippocampus and demonstrated here in human cortical activities, might constitute a general neural mechanism for sequence memory and learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Storing and retrieving temporal sequences of events (i.e., sequence memory), a capacity shared across species, is crucial to many cognitive functions, including speech recognition, movement planning, and episodic memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. For example, we retrieve a stream of serially ordered events when recalling past personal experience, and we memorize numbers in order when trying to call a friend. Swinging the racket to hit an incoming ball in a tennis match similarly involves the planning and controlling of a chain of movement elements over time.</p>
<p>To accomplish sequence memory, two core components &#x2013; the content (items) and the ordinal information (temporal order) &#x2013; of a sequence are vital to be encoded and maintained in working memory. There exists ample evidence that neural responses during the retention interval show a sustained load-dependent enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], suggesting that the maintenance of mnemonic contents is implemented by recurrent feedback loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], as well as suppression of irrelevant information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. That being said, retention of the sequence order information in memory cannot solely rely on an overall enhancement of neural activity and presumably requires the temporally segregated representations of individual items. Theoretical models postulate that sequence memory is mediated by a theta-gamma coupled neuronal oscillatory mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], such that individual items of the list/sequence, encoded in gamma-band activities, occur at the different phases of a theta-band rhythm. A recent MEG study provides important evidence supporting this theta-gamma coupling model during the memory <italic>encoding</italic> period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Moreover, by asking subjects to mentally replay short sound or video clips, the temporal phase patterns of the neural activities during memory retrieval are found to be similar to that during memory encoding, further advocating the preservation of temporal information of the stimulus in working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Working memory contents have also been suggested to be maintained in rapid transition in dynamic hidden states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, how the human brain represents and maintains temporal order information during the memory <italic>retention</italic> period, when the stimulus sequence is not present, remains unknown.</p>
<p>Despite this gap, it is well-established in animal studies that place cells in rodent hippocampus fire in the same or the reversed order in which they appear during previous spatial navigation, in both awake and asleep status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In contrast to rodent studies in which sequential trajectory of place cell firing could be explicitly assessed to explore reactivation profiles during memory maintenance, human studies have provided more limited access to the item-specific reactivation profiles at the neuronal ensemble level. To overcome this difficulty, in the present study, we employed sequence memory paradigms in combination with a temporal response function (TRF) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] to dissociate the item-specific neuronal response during the memory retention interval.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that each item in a memory list, characterized by an alpha-band neural profile, is successively reactivated to mediate the representation and preservation of ordinal information in memory. Importantly, this item-by-item neuronal profile does not simply echo the sequence in the external world but instead displays two intriguing properties compared to the actual stimulus sequence: reversal in order and compression in time. Specifically, the item that occupies a late position in the list is reactivated earlier (e.g., for sequence 1-2, the reactivation profile is 2-1 in order), and the whole list encompassing all items are compacted within a 200-400 ms temporal window. Most importantly, this backward reactivation profile is directly related to the subsequent recency effect in memory behavioral performance. Our study provides novel neural evidence in humans supporting that the sequence order information is encoded and preserved in a fast and reverse reactivation sequence.</p>

<title>Probing memory-related reactivations during retention period</title>
<p>Previous studies have provided evidence supporting the object-based nature of working memory such that all features of an object, even the task-irrelevant ones, will be stored automatically in working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Most importantly, color feature has been found to be the type of features that have the strongest conjunction with other features within an object [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Based on these findings, in Experiment 1, we used task-irrelevant color probes that were either memory-related or non-memory-related to examine whether we could tag the memory reactivations during the retention period when the to-be-remembered features (i.e., orientation features) were not present.</p>
<p>We recorded 64-channel EEG signals from human participants performing an adapted working memory task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Each trial consisted of three periods: encoding, maintaining, and recalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In short, subjects were instructed to memorize the orientation of the cued bar (&#x201C;encoding&#x201D;) and then held the information in working memory (&#x201C;maintaining&#x201D;), and finally performed a memory test on the orientation feature (&#x201C;recalling&#x201D;). Notably, during the maintaining period, participants performed a central fixation task (to control eye movements), with two task-irrelevant color discs presented simultaneously. Crucially, the two probes were either memory-related (i.e., with memory-matching color, WM) or non-memory-related (i.e., with memory-nonmatching color, NWM), and neither of them contained the to-be-memorized orientation features. They were displayed at either left or right side of the fixation cross to exclude spatial memory effects.</p>

<title>Paradigm for Experiment 1 (1-item memory task) and illustration of the TRF approach.</title>
<p>(A) A central arrow cue was first presented to indicate which of the following bars the participants should attend to. A sample array containing two bars then appeared and participants should memorize the orientation of the cued bar (&#x201C;encoding period&#x201D;). Next, a probe array containing two task-irrelevant disc probes with memory-matching color and non-memory-matching color were presented for 5 seconds (&#x201C;maintaining period&#x201D;), during which participants performed a central fixation task by monitoring an abrupt luminance change of the central fixation cross, while simultaneously holding the orientation information in memory. In the final &#x201C;recalling period&#x201D;, participants would judge which bar (upper or lower) has the same orientation as that of the cued bar. (B) During the 5 s maintaining period, the luminance of the two discs was continuously modulated according to two random temporal sequences respectively. At the same time, electroencephalography (EEG) responses were recorded. (C) The TRF approach was used to calculate the impulse brain response for the memory-related (left, WM-TRF) and non-memory-related (NWM-TRF) disc probes. TRF response characterizes the brain response to a unit increase in luminance of a stimulus sequence, as a function of time lag after each transient. Note that the WM-TRF and NWM-TRF were derived from the same EEG responses but were separated based on the corresponding stimulus luminance sequence. As a result, the computed WM-TRF and NWM-TRF would represent the elicited response for each unit transient at the WM and NWM probe respectively throughout the memory retention interval.</p></caption>

<p>Next, a temporal response function (TRF) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], which has been used to assess brain response that tracks ongoing changes in sound envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], visual luminance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], and even high-level properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], was employed to extract and isolate neuronal responses for the ongoing luminance change of the two probes (WM and NWM) respectively throughout the maintaining period. Specifically, the luminance of the two discs was modulated continuously according to two 5 sec random temporal sequences that were generated anew in each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The TRF responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) for the WM disc probe (WM-TRF) and NWM disc probe (NWM-TRF) were then calculated and dissociated from the same 5 sec EEG recordings, based on their corresponding stimulus temporal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Note that the TRF response is defined as the brain response to a unit luminance in the stimulus sequence, as a function of temporal lag after each transient. As a result, the two calculated TRF responses (i.e., WM-TRF and NWM-TRF) would represent the impulse response for the luminance sequence of the WM and NWM probes respectively, throughout the memory retention interval (see details about TRF approach in Methods). If the color feature is not specifically bound to the associated orientation features held in memory, we would expect no difference between the WM-TRF and NWM-TRF responses. On the other hand, if the two probes show distinct responses, it suggests that the task-irrelevant color probes could be used to tag the memory-related activations during retention.</p>

<title>Experiment 1: Alpha-band memory effects (one-item memory)</title>
<p>Eighteen participants participated in Experiment 1, and their memory performance was well above chance (N &#x003D; 18, mean accuracy &#x003D; 0.888, s.e. &#x003D; 0.029; One-sample t-test, df &#x003D; 17, <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 26.34, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001, CI: [0.357, 0.419], Cohen&#x2019;s d &#x003D; 6.208). First, the overall TRF response for the color probes showed clear alpha-band patterns and was robust at single subject level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We next performed a spectrotemporal analysis on the WM-TRF and NWM-TRF responses (see the corresponding TRF waveforms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-supplement 2A</xref>) to examine their fine dynamic structures as a function of frequency (0-30 Hz) and time (0-0.6 s), and this was done on each channel and in each participant separately. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, both WM-TRF (left panel) and NWM-TRF (right panel) demonstrated clear sustained alpha-band activations (8-11 Hz; permutation test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, corrected, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-supplement 2C</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We then first selected channels that showed overall significant larger WM&#x002B;NWM alpha-band responses (one-sample t-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05; compared to the average of all channels). Among the resulted channels, three electrodes (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) passed the statistical test on the WM-NWM alpha-band difference (bootstrap test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.058, FDR corrected across channels and time) and were defined as &#x2018;channel of interest&#x2019; for all the subsequent analysis, including those in Experiment 2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the &#x2018;channel-of-interest&#x2019; showed enhanced alpha-band power for WM-TRF compared to NWM-TRF within the latency of around 200-500 ms. We then extracted the alpha-band time courses within the channel-of-interest. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, WM (red) showed significant alpha-band enhancement than NWM (black) from 310 ms to 370 ms (bootstrap test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.046, FDR corrected across time), supporting the alpha-band memory effect.</p>

</fig>
<p>The WM and NWM probes were presented in two visual fields, and therefore the observed alpha memory effect might be just due to spatial attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We further performed two additional analysis to address the issue. First, we examined the alpha-band memory effects (WM-NWM) for the left and right discs separately and observed a similar spatial distribution without statistically significant lateralization effects (paired t-test, N &#x003D; 18; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-supplement 3A</xref>). Second, we compared the alpha power between channels that are contralateral to WM probe and channels contralateral to NWM probe and did not find significant difference (paired t-test, N &#x003D; 18; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, the alpha-mediated memory effects during maintenance could not be interpreted by spatial attention. This is also consistent with recent findings supporting memory-related hidden states in the absence of attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that during the central fixation task (see eye movement profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S4">Figure 2-supplement 4B</xref>), WM and NWM probes were both task-irrelevant, and the only difference between them were on the color (i.e., memory-related or nonmemory-related). Therefore, the observed difference between the WM-TRF and NWM-TRF responses indicate that the task-irrelevant color probes did carry memory-related information, consistent with previous findings advocating the object-based nature of working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The results also suggest that we could use task-irrelevant color probes to tag the memory-associated reactivations during maintenance, by using the alpha-band temporal profile as a neural signature (no effects in other frequency bands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-supplement 3C</xref>). See further analysis about the alpha-band in TRF responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S4">Figure 2-supplement 4A</xref>.</p>

<title>Experiment 2: Sequential alpha-band response for sequence memory</title>
<p>We next examined how a temporal sequence and the associated order information is maintained in working memory. Nineteen participants participated in Experiment 2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, participants were first presented with a sample array containing three bars with different orientations and different colors. Next, two of the three bars were randomly selected and serially cued, and importantly, participants should memorize not only the orientation of the two cued bars but also their temporal order (i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> orientation). During the following 5 sec &#x201C;maintaining period&#x201D;, participants performed a central fixation task and held the orientation sequence in memory. In the final &#x201C;recalling period&#x201D;, participants compared the orientation of the bar in the test array with the memorized orientations (e.g. is it more similar to the orientation of the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 2<sup>nd</sup> cued bars?). Therefore, subjects should memorize the temporal order of the orientation sequence.</p>

<p>Crucially, the probe array during the maintaining period now consisted of three disc probes &#x2013; one 1<sup>st</sup>-memory-related probe (i.e., matching color with the 1<sup>st</sup> cued bar), one 2<sup>nd</sup>-memory-related probe (i.e., matching color with the 2<sup>nd</sup> cued bar), and one non-memory-related probe (i.e., matching color with the non-cued bar). The three discs were presented at three random spatial locations on a ring to exclude spatial memory effects. Again, the luminance of the three disc probes was modulated continuously according to three random sequences respectively. The corresponding TRF responses (1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF, 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF, and NWM-TRF) were then computed from the same 5 sec EEG recordings, and a spectrotemporal analysis was performed on them for each channel and in each participant separately (see TRF waveforms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2B</xref>). Notably, all the analysis was performed in the channel-of-interest, which was independently defined in Experiment 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>First, significant recency effect (i.e., 2<sup>nd</sup> item better than 1<sup>st</sup> item) in behavioral performance was found (N &#x003D; 19, 1<sup>st</sup> item: mean &#x003D; 0.794, s.e. &#x003D; 0.020; 2<sup>nd</sup> item: mean &#x003D; 0.840, s.e &#x003D; 0.014; recency effect: mean &#x003D; 0.047, s.e. &#x003D; 0.020; paired t-test, df &#x003D; 18, <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 2.378, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.029, CI: [0.005, 0.089], Cohen&#x2019;s d &#x003D; 0.532). Moreover, the alpha-band memory effects (i.e., WM&#x2013;NWM difference averaged within the whole 600 ms time range, bootstrap test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.047) revealed in Experiment 1 were still present here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Most interestingly, the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF and the 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF displayed distinct alpha-band temporal courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Specifically, the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF alpha-band response (red line) was temporally delayed by approximately 200 ms relative to that of the 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF response (blue line). We next normalized the alpha-band power temporal profiles by subtracting the averaged alpha-band time courses across all the three TRFs from that for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF, 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF and NWM-TRF respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> illustrates the normalized alpha-band temporal profile, showing a reverse sequential activation profile (i.e., alpha-band activation for the 1<sup>st</sup> item followed by that for the 2<sup>nd</sup> item). Specifically, the 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF showed response around 80-100 ms, whereas the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF around 260-300 ms (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, one-sided t-test). It is noteworthy that the backward sequential response profiles were consistent across electrodes and items (see control analysis for each channels and for different item combinations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-supplement 1AB</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the statistical significance of the sequential activation, we calculated the cross-correlation coefficient between the normalized alpha-band profile for the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF and the 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF responses and then performed a permutation test by shuffling condition labels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (top panel), the 1<sup>st</sup>-to-2<sup>nd</sup> crosscorrelation coefficient at a temporal lag of around &#x2212;170 ms was significant (permutation test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, corrected), supporting that the 2<sup>nd</sup> item alpha-band activations essentially preceded that for the 1<sup>st</sup> item (i.e., negative temporal lag) by around 170 ms. Furthermore, we observed a similar but weaker trend of reverse serial reactivation profile in a 3-item sequence memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S2">Figure 3-supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the item-by-item sequential responses, we also observed a trend of repeated activations for the same item (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We thus calculated the within-item autocorrelation coefficient to examine the temporal period of the recurrent activations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (bottom panel), the temporal lag of &#x007E;390 ms was statistically significant (permutation test, shuffling between condition labels, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, corrected). This suggests that the two items in the memory list are further organized into a recurring approximately 400 ms temporal chunk, within which sequentially memorized items reactivates one after another in a reversed order.</p>

<title>Relation to sequence memory behavior</title>
<p>We further evaluated whether the alpha-mediated memory reactivation during the retention period might have behavioral relevance. We first examined the relationship between the WM-NWM alpha-band enhancement and the 1-item memory performance in Experiment 1. All the participants were divided based on their memory accuracy into &#x201C;high-performance&#x201D; (N &#x003D; 9, mean &#x003D; 0.907, s.e. &#x003D; 0.018) and &#x201C;low-performance&#x201D; (N &#x003D; 9, mean &#x003D; 0.796, s.e. &#x003D; 0.053) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then used the same analysis to assess the alpha-band courses for the two groups separately. Similar to the grand average results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the high-performance group showed enhanced WM-NWM alpha-band power difference within 300-400 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas the low-performance group showed weaker enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the high- and low-performance groups displayed non-overlapping confidence interval in the alpha-band memory effects (WM-NWM alpha power difference averaged from 310 to 370 ms, a time range selected based on group results, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the stronger the alpha-band memory effects (i.e., Alpha<sub>WM</sub> &#x003E; Alpha<sub>NWM</sub>) were, the better were the corresponding memory behavioral performances.</p>

<p>Participants in Experiment 2 (2-item sequence memory) were divided into two groups based on their memory recency effects (memory performance<sub>2nd item</sub> &#x2013; memory performance<sub>1st item</sub>): the &#x201C;high-recency&#x201D; group (N &#x003D; 9, mean &#x003D; 0.116, s.e. &#x003D; 0.020) and the &#x201C;low-recency&#x201D; group (N &#x003D; 9, mean &#x003D; &#x2212;0.021, s.e. &#x003D; 0.017) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). First, both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FG</xref>) showed similar reverse sequential responses profiles, similar to that in the group results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, the &#x201C;high-recency&#x201D; group displayed a strong and significant backward-sequential alpha profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; permutation test, 1-2 cross-correlation coefficient at lag of &#x2212;170 ms, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4-supplement 1A</xref>), whereas the &#x201C;low-recency&#x201D; group displayed weak and nonsignificant sequential responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; permutation test, 1-2 cross-correlation coefficient at lag of &#x2212;170 ms, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4-supplement 1</xref>). To further compare the difference in reactivation profiles between the two groups, we examined the 2<sup>nd</sup>-1<sup>st</sup> alpha power difference for the two groups at three time ranges (<italic>phase 1</italic>: 140-180 ms; <italic>phase 2</italic>: 280-320 ms; <italic>phase 3</italic>: 470-510ms; shaded regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FG</xref>), which were selected based on group results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, interestingly, the main difference between the high- and low-recency groups was on the 2<sup>nd</sup> TRF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FGH</xref>). Specifically, the high-recency group elicited stronger 2<sup>nd</sup> item response than the low-recency group (phase 1 and phase 3, non-overlapping confidence intervals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; permutation test by shuffling between high- and low-recency groups, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.08), whereas both groups elicited similar 1<sup>st</sup> item response (phase 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; permutation test by shuffling between high- and low-recency groups, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.48). Thus, our results support an essential association between the backward sequential reactivations and recency effect in sequence memory behavior. We also performed an additional analysis by dividing subjects based on their memory accuracy rather than the recency, and the two groups elicited quite similar backward sequential responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-supplement 1C</xref>), excluding the possibility that it is the memory strength rather than the recency effect that leads to the observed backward sequential responses.</p>
<p>Taken together, the alpha-mediated reactivation profile during the memory retention period is related to subsequent memory behavioral performance. Importantly, there exists an essential relationship between the backward item-by-item reactivation during maintenance and the subsequent recency effect, a behavioral index for sequence memory.</p>

<title>Response bias control</title>
<p>In Experiment 2, subjects were instructed to decide whether the orientation of the bar in the test array was similar to the orientation of the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 2<sup>nd</sup> memorized orientations, and the behavioral performance showed significant recency effect (i.e., 2nd item better than 1st item). Meanwhile, although the accuracy for both items were high, response bias might still be a confounding factor for the observed recency effect (e.g., biased to report the probe to more resemble the 2<sup>nd</sup> item). To address the issue, we ran a control study (N &#x003D; 11) by employing a new behavioral procedure that would not be contaminated by response bias. Specifically, the experiment paradigm was the same as Experiment 2 except that rather than making a binary response in the recalling period, subjects were instructed to rotate a bar to the memorized orientation. By calculating the angular deviation between the reported orientation and the true orientation of the memorized bar, in combination with a probabilistic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], we could estimate the target response probability for the 1st and the 2nd WM item separately, independent of response bias. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the target response probability was significantly larger for the 2nd item than that for the 1st item (df&#x003D;10, one-tail paired t-test, <italic>t</italic> &#x003D; 2.052, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.034, CI: [-0.003, 0.083], Cohen&#x2019;s d &#x003D; 0.618), confirming the recency effect and excluding the response bias interpretation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We recorded EEG responses in human participants performing sequence memory tasks and employed a TRF approach to probe the neuronal response that specifically tracks each item of the temporal sequence during memory retention. Our results consistently demonstrate that individual items are successively reactivated, characterized by a sequence of alpha-band activities. Compared to the actual stimulus sequence, the serial neural replay is temporally compacted within a 200-400 ms chunk and is reverse in temporal order. Crucially, the backward reactivation is associated with the recency effect, a behavioral index signifying backward memory priority. Taken together, our results constitute novel neural evidence in humans supporting that the sequence order information is encoded and maintained in short-term memory by fast and backward serial reactivations.</p>
<p>Temporally sequenced activations have also been reported in several recent human studies. For example, after being trained in a reasoning task that involves selecting a statistically related object path, the brain spontaneously displays a fast successive representation of states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Recently, an fMRI study demonstrates that flashing only the starting point of a learned sequence would trigger a prediction wave of responses in primary visual cortices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Finally, a MEG study examined the theta-gamma coupling strength as participants were presented with picture sequences, and found that the gamma power shifts along the phase of a theta rhythm as more items are added to memory, thus supporting the &#x201C;phase coding&#x201D; model for episodic memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Meanwhile, our results are different from this important work and reveal distinct mechanisms. First, we examined the memory retention period when items were not presented, whereas the previous work studied the encoding period when items appeared serially. Second, we demonstrate backward reactivations whereas the previous study supports a forward-playing profile, further suggesting a fundamental distinction between memory encoding and retention.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the item-by-item reactivation during memory retention period is temporally reversed in order. Previous neurophysiological recordings in monkeys have revealed forward serial activations in prefrontal population activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Moreover, sequences within hippocampus in rats have been observed in both forward and reverse order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and interestingly, the backward sequence has been shown during awake periods immediately after spatial experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. A recent MEG work has also found the backward trajectory of representations of states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] during a reasoning task. Why is the sequential reactivation reverse in temporal order during memory maintenance? One interpretation comes from reinforcement learning model, which proposes that the recent item would be the starting and anchoring point for propagating information backward along incoming trajectories to build a recency-weighted running average of the rewards received for each action taken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Another interesting possibility derives from the &#x2018;activity-silent&#x2019; model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], which proposes that the contents of working memory are mediated by dynamic hidden states. These memory-related hidden states could be pinged and inferred out during maintenance in the absence of attention and lingering delay activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Here, in our experiments, the TRF response could be regarded as the emerged item-specific activation after each pinging (i.e., each unit luminance transient in the probe stimulus). Consequently, the item associated with stronger excitability (i.e., the recent item) would appear with shorter latency compared to the item associated with weaker excitability (i.e., the early item), resulting in the reversed sequential reactivation as we observed here. Furthermore, instead of presenting each item sequentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], here all the items in the list were displayed simultaneously followed by serial cuing (to exclude the possibility that serial presentation might result in different encoding strengths). Meanwhile, how the sequence is presented (sequential or simultaneous) might be another factor accounting for the order of reactivations.</p>
<p>The memory reactivations during the rehearsal period are compressed in time, also in agreement with previous neurophysiological recordings in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The reorganization of events with regard to the internal temporal framework, presumably mediated by neuronal oscillations of various rhythms (e.g., theta, alpha, gamma, etc.), may contribute to memory consolidation. Discrete epochs of events that are temporally separated in the external world can be successfully associated in the brain within an appropriate time frame, which might be vital for neuronal plasticity mechanism to operate on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], and similar time compression mechanism might mediate sequence maintenance in working memory as well.</p>
<p>A recent EEG study has revealed that attention samples multiple visual objects in a temporally sequential manner even when subjects maintained sustained attention at one object [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. We would argue that sequential attentional sampling could not account for the present observations. First, previous study showed that attention would first sample the item associated with highest attentional priority and then would shift to the item associated with less attentional priority. However here, all the items in the sequence should be attended with the same priority and thus would not be sequentially sampled by attention. Second, previous sequential pattern (attended before unattended) could not reasonably account for the backward reactivation here. Furthermore, the backward sequential pattern and its association with the recency effect might be also explained by &#x201C;memory strength&#x201D; interpretation. For example, the better the memory strength of the item is (e.g., better memory strength for the 2<sup>nd</sup> item over the 1<sup>st</sup> item), the earlier the response latency would be (e.g., earlier response for the 2<sup>nd</sup> item compared to the 1<sup>st</sup> item). To test the account, we performed a control analysis by dividing subjects in Experiment 2 into two groups based on their memory accuracy rather than the recency, and then examined the respective response profiles. If the alternative interpretation were correct, we would expect to see temporal shift in the response pattern between the two groups such that the high-accuracy group would show earlier response compared to the low-accuracy group. However, the two groups elicited quite similar backward sequential responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3S1">Figure 3-supplement 1C</xref>), excluding the possibility that it is the memory strength rather than the recency effect that leads to the observed backward sequential responses.</p>
<p>Finally, our results exhibit alpha-mediated responses during memory retention, also consistent with previous working memory findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. It is well acknowledged that alpha-band neuronal activities play a key function in working memory by efficiently suppressing distracting information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. For instance, increased memory load is associated with enhanced alpha-band activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at alpha frequency modulates the short-term memory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Moreover, memory reinstatement has been found to be accompanied by alpha-band activities, which carries a temporal phase signature of the replayed stimulus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Meanwhile, in addition to the traditionally posited inhibitory function in many cognitive processes [6, 10, 49, 50] alpha-band neuronal oscillations have recently been found to implement an &#x2018;&#x2018;echo&#x2019;&#x2019; or reverberation of the inputs.</p>
<p>These alpha echoes are indeed enhanced by visual attention, supporting an additional role of the alpha-band rhythm in the maintenance of sensory representations over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Taken together, we would like to reason that the memory-related alpha response in our results reflects memory reactivations rather than inhibition, based on several facts. First, previous studies using TRF approach have revealed enhancement in alpha-echoes under attended condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], which could not be interpreted by inhibitory account. Second, the memory-related alpha responses did not show spatial attention effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S2">Figure 2-supplement 2</xref>), which are well known to be mediated by inhibitory alpha activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Finally, WM showed stronger alpha responses than NWM here and were strongly associated with memory behavior, further excluding the inhibitory interpretation. We would like to propose that the alpha-band activity in TRF responses might represent the stimulus-induced phase resetting of the intrinsic alpha-band oscillation in EEG activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], given their close associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S3">Figure 2-supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results provide converging evidence supporting that the sequence order information is represented and consolidated in short-term memory by an item-by-item serial reactivation mechanism. Crucially, the serial reactivation, temporally compressed (i.e., within a 200-400 ms window) and reversed in temporal order (i.e., backward reactivation), is essentially associated with the subsequent memory behavioral performance. This fast-backward replay during maintenance, previously revealed in rat hippocampus for spatial navigation and shown here in humans for a non-spatial task, might therefore constitute a general neural mechanism for sequence memory and learning.</p>

<p>Twenty subjects participated in Experiment 1. Twenty subjects participated in Experiment 2. Eleven subjects participated in the control study. During data collection and preprocessing, two subjects in Experiment 1, and one subject in Experiment 2 were excluded due to overall low behavioral performance, excessive eye movements, or not finishing the whole experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent prior to the start of the experiment, which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Peking University (2015-03-05c2).</p>

<title>Stimuli and tasks</title>
<p>Participants sat in a dark room in front of a CRT monitor with 100 Hz refresh rate, and their heads were stabilized using a chin rest. In each trial of all experiments, there were three periods: encoding period, maintaining period, and recalling period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Participants were asked to only memorize the orientation of the cued bars (0.38&#x00B0;&#x00D7;1.15&#x00B0;visual angle).</p>
<p>During each trial, all participants were instructed to keep the number of eye blinks to be minimum. Eye movements were monitored using an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research). The experimental trial was initiated only when fixation was located within 1&#x00B0; visual angle of the fixation cross. The results showed that the participants maintained good fixation on the central cross (within 1&#x00B0;) throughout each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S4">Figure 2-supplement 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Experiments 1 (1-item memory)</title>
<p>In Experiment 1, participants should memorize the orientation of the cued bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the beginning of each trial, a central arrow cue (1-s duration) pointing to upper or lower location was presented to indicate which of the following bars the participants should attend to. A sample array containing two bars then appeared 3&#x00B0; visual angle above and below the fixation for 1 s. One bar was red and the other was blue. The orientation of one bar was chosen randomly within a range between 25&#x00B0; and 65&#x00B0; and the other was between 115&#x00B0; and 155&#x00B0; (0&#x00B0; is vertical). The colors and orientations at each location were counterbalanced across trials. Participants were instructed to memorize the orientation of the bar at the cued location (&#x201C;encoding period&#x201D;). After a blank interval (0.6&#x007E;1 s), probe array containing two task-irrelevant discs (3&#x00B0; in radius) with either memory-matching color or non-memory-matching color were presented to the left or right of the fixation (7&#x00B0; in eccentricity) for 5 s (&#x201C;maintaining period&#x201D;). The colors of the two disc probes were counterbalanced across trials. During this 5 s maintaining period, participants performed a central fixation task by continuously monitoring an abrupt luminance change of the central fixation cross, while simultaneously holding the orientation information of the cued bar in memory. In 25&#x0025; of trials, luminance of the fixation cross would dim for 0.2 s during 1 s to 3.8 s, and participants need to make a self-paced response afterward. The purpose of this fixation task was to control eye movements during memory maintenance, given the presence of two luminance-changing color probes. In the final &#x201C;recalling period&#x201D;, a test array consisting of two bars appeared 3&#x00B0; visual angle above and below the fixation. One bar was in the same orientation as the memorized bar, whereas the other was tilted &#x002B;20 or &#x2212;20 degrees relative to the memorized orientation. The location (upper or lower) of the matching and nonmatching bars were counterbalanced across trials. Participants would judge which bar (upper or lower) has the same orientation as that of the cued bar. Participants completed 128 trials in total.</p>

<title>Experiments 2 (2-item sequence memory)</title>
<p>Experiment 2 was a 2-item sequence memory task. Different from Experiment 1, participants should memorize not only the orientations of two serially cued bars but also their temporal order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Specifically, at the beginning of each trial, three bars with different orientations and different colors (red, green or blue) were presented at the same eccentricity to the fixation (3&#x00B0; visual angle). Next, two of the three bars were randomly selected and serially cued by dimmed luminance to inform participants to memorize their orientations and temporal order (orientation of the 1<sup>st</sup> cued bar and the orientation of the 2<sup>nd</sup> cued bar). The orientation of the first memorized bar was randomly selected between 30&#x00B0; and 150&#x00B0;. The second memorized bar was tilted &#x002B;25 or &#x2212;25 degrees relative to the first memorized bar. The nonmemorized bar was tilted &#x002B;12.5 or &#x2212;12.5 degrees relative to the first memorized bar. Next, three disc probes with the same colors as that of the three bars respectively were presented for 5 s. The locations of three probes were randomly selected on a ring with a radius of 7&#x00B0; to exclude spatial memory effects (&#x201C;maintaining period&#x201D;). During this period, participants should do a fixation task by continuously detecting whether the luminance of fixation cross changed. At the end of each trial, a test bar was presented at the center of the screen with orientation tilted &#x002B;5 or &#x2212;5 degrees relative to the 1<sup>st</sup> memorized or 2nd memorized bar. Participants should compare the orientation of the bar with the memorized orientations (e.g. is it more similar to the orientation of the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 2<sup>nd</sup> cued bars?). Participants completed 96 trials in total.</p>

<title>Control study (2-item sequence memory)</title>
<p>In the control study, all the procedure was the same as Experiment 2 except that during the recalling period, rather than making a binary response, subjects were instructed to rotate a test bar to either the 1<sup>st</sup> memorized orientation or the 2<sup>nd</sup> memorized orientation, and the orientations of the two bars were randomly selected between 0&#x00B0; and 180&#x00B0;. By calculating the angular deviation between the reported orientation and the true orientation of the memorized bar, in combination with a probabilistic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], we could estimate the target response probability for the 1st and the 2nd WM item separately, independent of response bias.</p>

<title>Luminance modulation</title>
<p>A TRF approach was employed to examined and dissociate the probe-specific impulse responses during the 5 s memory maintaining period. To enable the TRF estimation, the luminance of each of the disc probes was independently modulated in time at each refreshing frame (100 Hz monitor refresh rate), according to the corresponding temporal sequence that was generated anew in each trial (2 temporal sequences in Experiment 1; 3 temporal sequences in Experiment 2). Each random sequence was tailored to have equal power at all frequencies by normalizing the amplitudes of its Fourier components before applying an inverse Fourier transform. Luminance sequences ranged from dark (0 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) to bright (13 cd/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<title>EEG recordings</title>
<p>EEG was recorded continuously using a 64-channel EasyCap and 2 BrainAmp amplifiers (BrainProducts). Vertical and horizontal electrooculograms were recorded by 2 additional electrodes around the participants&#x2019; eyes. EEG data were offline bandpass filtered between 2 and 50 Hz. Independent component analysis was performed independently for each subject to remove eye-movement and artifact components, and the remaining components were back-projected onto the EEG electrode space. All channels were then referenced to the average value of all channels. The EEG was downsampled to 100 Hz before TRF calculation to be matched with the temporal resolution of the luminance sequences. To avoid the influence of the onset EEG response in each trial, which may bias the estimated TRF results, we extracted the middle part of the 5-s EEG trial responses (0.5&#x2013;4.5 s) for further TRF calculation.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>TRF computation</title>
<p>The mapping between the stimulus luminance sequence and the recorded EEG data were characterized by TRF response using the multivariate temporal response function (mTRF) toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The TRF response describes the brain&#x2019;s response for unit transient in the stimulus temporal sequence and characterizes the brain&#x2019;s linear transformation of a stimulus input, S(t), to the neural response output, R(t), as R(t) &#x003D; TRF&#x002A;S(t), where &#x002A; denotes the convolution operator. Specifically, the TRF response for each probe (e.g., 1<sup>st</sup> WM TRF, 2<sup>nd</sup> WM TRF, and NWM TRF), as a function of temporal lag, was calculated from the same EEG recordings, based on the corresponding stimulus temporal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically in the present experiment, the resulted TRF responses would characterize the neural response for each unit transient of the luminance sequence at each probe (e.g., 1<sup>st</sup> WM, 2<sup>nd</sup> WM, and NWM TRF) throughout the memory retention interval. In each experiment, the TRF analysis was performed for each probe, on each channel, and in each subject respectively.</p>
<p>The TRF analysis, based on the linear relationships between the luminance sequence and the brain response, has been previously used and validated in both visual and auditory studies to examine the brain response that specifically tracks sound envelope or luminance sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Recently, TRF has even be revealed to be able to track high-level features, such as global form coherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and semantic dissimilarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In fact, TRF approach is a quite robust and conservative way to assess the neural response to luminance change. Furthermore, previous studies have also demonstrated that applying a quadratic extension of the linear TRF approach only resulted in slight improvement compared to linear model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], further advocating the linear assumption in TRF calculation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reliable estimation of TRF response would require neural signals with enough temporal length as well as the corresponding length of stimulus sequences, from which the TRF response characterizing their linear relationship could be calculated. Previous study has proposed that neural signals of at least 120 secs would be needed to obtain TRF responses with reasonable SNR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Theoretically, dissociating multiple TRFs from brain signals would require even longer signals.</p>
<p>Back to our studies, each trial was 5 s, and we only analyzed the middle 4 s to avoid influences from onset and offset response. Therefore, to obtain TRF responses for multiple probes (e.g., 2 TRFs in Experiment 1 and 3 TRFs in Experiment 2), we would need at least more than 40 trials for the calculation. Therefore, TRF calculation at single-trial level, unless the trial is designed to be very long, could not meet the signal length requirement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d2">
<title>Time-frequency analysis</title>
<p>The obtained TRF responses were then analyzed with MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts), using the FieldTrip toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>] and wavelet toolbox functions to examine the spectrotemporal power profiles. Specifically, the TRF temporal profile was transformed using the continuous complex Gaussian wavelet (order &#x003D; 4; e.g., FWHM &#x003D; 1.32 s for 1 Hz wavelet) transform (Wavelet toolbox, MATLAB), with frequencies ranging from1 to 30 Hz in increments of 1 Hz, for each probe, on each channel, and in each subject respectively. The alpha-band (8-11 Hz) power profiles were then extracted from the output of the wavelet transform for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d3">
<title>Channel-of-interest</title>
<p>We first selected channels that showed overall significant larger WM&#x002B;NWM alpha-band TRF responses (one-sample t-test, two-tailed, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05; compared to the average of all channels) within the 0.6 s in Experiment 1. Among the resulted 17 channels (P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, P8, PO7, PO3, POz, PO4, PO8, O1, Oz, O2), we next used a bootstrap procedure (bootstrapping number &#x003D;1000) to resample the mean of WM-NWM alpha difference time course for each channel. We then used FDR (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.058) to correct the multiple comparison across channels (17 channels) and time (0-600 ms). Three parietal electrodes (Pz, P1, and P2) passed the test and were selected as &#x2018;channel-of-interest&#x2019; for all the subsequent analysis, including those in Exp. 2 and the control study. The alpha-band power profiles were then averaged within the channel-of-interest for all the subsequent analysis. Selection first based on the overall EEG alpha power rather than the alpha in TRF responses led to the same channel selection. It is noteworthy that we stated threshold (e.g., <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) when performing selection based on some criteria, and stated exact p-values when reporting results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d4">
<title>Normalization</title>
<p>The alpha-band power profiles of the TRF responses were normalized by subtracting the averaged alpha-band time courses across all the TRFs (e.g., WM and NWM in Experiment 1; 1<sup>st</sup> WM, 2<sup>nd</sup> WM, and NWM in Experiment 2) from each alpha-band TRF profile and in each subject respectively. It is notable that in Experiment 1, given there was only one WM item, the normalization WM-(WM&#x002B;NWM)/2 was equal to (WM-NWM)/2. We were more interested in examining the item-specific activation profile relative to the general TRF response (e.g., how item 1 was different from all the other probes), and therefore chose the averaged alpha-band profile across all probes rather than that of the NWM probe only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d5">
<title>Correlation coefficient calculation and permutation test</title>
<p>To examine the sequential activation in Experiment 2, we calculated the crosscorrelation coefficient between the normalized alpha-band profile for the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF and the 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF responses (Experiment 2). To test the statistical significance of the sequential activations (cross-correlation coefficient) in Experiment 2, we performed permutation test by shuffling the labels across conditions (i.e., between 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-related and 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-related probes). This shuffling was performed in each subject separately. We then used the same analysis for the original data to recalculate the surrogate TRF responses and the corresponding cross-correlation coefficients as a function of time lag. The analysis was repeated 500 times, and we could then obtain a distribution for the cross-correlation coefficient at each time lag, from which the 0.05 permutation threshold was estimated. The largest threshold across all temporal lags was set as the multiple-comparison corrected threshold (corrected). The same permutation was performed to also test the within-item autocorrelation coefficients. As to the statistical test for the cross-correlation coefficient in the high-recency and low-recency subject groups in Experiment 2, we did the same permutation test within each group respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4S1">Figure 4-supplement 1</xref>). To compare the difference between groups, we performed a permutation test by shuffling data between high and low groups for 1000 times. The same analysis was then performed on the surrogate data. The original high-low group difference (the averaged 2<sup>nd</sup> -1<sup>st</sup> alpha power in phase 1 and phase 3) was then compared to the permutation distribution, resulting in its corresponding p-value.</p>
<p>To examine the spectral contents of the TRF responses across all channels in Experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2S1">Figure 2-supplement 1C</xref>), we did a permutation test by shuffling the relationship between stimulus sequence and EEG signals for 500 times, from which the 0.05 threshold level as a function of frequency was estimated. Multiple comparison was corrected by setting the maximum threshold across frequencies as the corrected threshold.</p>

<title>Confidence interval estimation</title>
<p>We used a jackknife procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], during which one subject was removed at a time, to estimate the confidence interval of the mean of the alpha-band responses in each group (e.g., high- and low-performance groups in Experiment 1; high- and low-recency groups in Experiment 2), due to the small sample size of each group.</p>

<title>TRF responses in occipital channels in Experiment 1 and the TRF power spectrum.</title>
<p>(A) TRF temporal waveforms of two representative subjects (upper panel) and grand average results (Experiment 1, N &#x003D; 18; lower panel, shaded areas represent SEM across subjects), calculated by the linear regression between luminance sequence and the corresponding EEG signal (black line, original data), or by shuffling the pairing between luminance sequence and EEG signals (red line, shuffled data). (B) Power spectrum of TRF responses for representative subjects (upper panel) and grand average (N&#x003D;18) power spectrum (lower panel), for original data (black) and shuffled data (red). (C) Distribution map for the alpha-band (8-11 Hz) power difference between the original data and the shuffled data. The TRF responses in the current experiment are consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and robust at single subject level.</p></caption>

<p>(A) TRF waveforms for Experiment 1. Grand average (N &#x003D; 18) WM-TRF (red line, mean &#x00B1; SEM), and NWM-TRF waveforms (black line, mean &#x00B1; SEM). (B) TRFs waveforms for Experiment 2.

It is notable that our main results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>-3) were based on induced analysis (e.g., performing time-frequency analysis in individual subject and then averaging time-frequency power across subjects) whereas the temporal waveforms here plots the &#x201C;evoked&#x201D; activities (the grand average temporal waveforms). Only when individual subject elicited phase-locked alpha-band TRF response, we would observe a clear 10 Hz oscillatory pattern in the grand average TRF responses.

<title>Control analysis and eye movement distribution.</title>
<p>(A) The alpha-band activities were filtered out before TRF calculation, resulting in the lack of alpha-band activities in TRF responses (compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The results are consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and support the view that the alpha in TRF derives from the &#x2018;real&#x2019; alpha-band activity in EEG signals rather than reflecting other high-frequency components. (B) Subject maintained good central fixation throughout experiment (right panel). The eye position distribution did not show spatial bias when the WM probe was either at the left side (left panel) or the right side (middle panel).</p></caption>

<title>Control analysis.</title>
<p>(A) Grand average (N&#x003D;30, pooling across experiment 2 and response bias control experiment) normalized alpha power time courses (mean &#x00B1; SEM) for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF (red) and 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF (blue) on electrode Pz (solid line), P1 (line with solid circle), and P2 (line with hollow circle), supporting that the backward sequential profiles were consistent across electrodes. (B) To examine whether different items would elicit distinct temporal patterns (e.g., red probes would be associated with responses with earlier latency, etc.), we replotted the TRF responses for different combinations of colors (i.e., red, blue, and green). If probes with different colors elicited different temporal patterns, we would expect to see inconsistent response profiles for different items. Grand average normalized alpha power time courses (mean &#x00B1; SEM) for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF (red) and 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF (blue) for different combinations of items (solid line: red&#x002B;yellow; line with solid circle: blue&#x002B;green; line with hollow circle: red&#x002B;blue). All the three combinations showed similar backward sequential activations, supporting that the observed sequential activations were consistent across items, and were not biased by certain item. (C) To test the &#x201C;memory strength&#x201D; interpretation (the better the memory strength of the item is, the earlier the response latency would be), subjects in Experiment 2 were divided into two groups based on their memory accuracy rather than the recency effect. Grand average normalized alpha-band power time courses for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF (red) and 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF (blue) for the high-accuracy (sold line) and low-accuracy groups (dashed line). The two groups elicited quite similar backward sequential responses rather than showing temporal shift, excluding the possibility that it is the memory strength rather than the recency effect that leads to the observed backward sequential responses.</p></caption>

<title>Paradigm and results for 3-item sequence memory task (N&#x003D;15).</title>
<p>(A) Four T-like items with different colors and different orientations were first presented. Three of the four items were randomly selected and serially cued, and participants should memorize not only the orientation of the three cued bars but also their temporal order (i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> orientation). During the 5 s &#x201C;maintaining period&#x201D;, participants performed a central fixation task and held the 3-item orientation sequence in memory. In the final &#x201C;recalling period&#x201D;, participants compared the orientation of the bar in the test array with the memorized orientations (e.g. is it more similar to the orientation of the 1<sup>st</sup> or the 2<sup>nd</sup> or the 3<sup>rd</sup> cued bars?). Correspondingly, the probe array during the 5 s maintaining period now consisted of four disc probes &#x2013; three memory-related probes and one non-memory-related probe, the luminance of which were modulated continuously and their respective TRF responses (1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF, 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF, 3<sup>rd</sup>-WM-TRF, and NWM-TRF) were calculated respectively. The same spectrotemporal and normalization analysis was performed on the TRF responses for each channel and in each participant separately. (B) Normalized grand average (N &#x003D; 15) alpha power time courses in the channel-of-interest defined in Experiment 1, for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF (red), 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF (blue), 3<sup>rd</sup>-WM-TRF (green), and NWM-TRF (black). Notably, consistent with Experiment 2, the normalized three-item alpha-band power profile again displayed a reverse response trend, but on top of a slowly developing trend (dotted lines). C) The three normalized alpha-band time courses were further detrended by removing their respective slow developing trends (dotted lines) to better visualize the sequential temporal profiles. Normalized and detrended alpha power time courses for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF (red), 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF (blue), and 3<sup>rd</sup>-WM-TRF (green) in the channel-of-interest. (D) Cross-correlation coefficient between the normalized and detrended alpha-band profile for the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF and the 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF responses (blue line), and that between the 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF and 3<sup>rd</sup>-WM-TRF (green line). The dashed lines represent the corresponding statistical significance threshold (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, permutation test, corrected). The 1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup> (green line) and the 1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> (blue line) cross-correlation coefficients were significant at a temporal lag of around &#x2212;60 ms and &#x2212;120 ms respectively. (E) Autocorrelation coefficient for the detrended and normalized alpha power time courses for 1<sup>st</sup>-WM-TRF (red), 2<sup>nd</sup>-WM-TRF (blue), 3<sup>rd</sup>-WM-TRF (green), and the averaged autocorrelation coefficient (black) (black dots: <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05, permutation test, corrected).</p></caption>

It is notable that the high-recency group passed the test whereas the low-recency group did not.

It is notable that the samples in the high-recency group showed dominant higher ranks compared to those in the low-recency group.</p></caption>
