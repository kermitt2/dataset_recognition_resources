<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Very little is known about the muscle regeneration process that follows myonecrosis induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, the main agent of gas gangrene. This study revealed that, in a murine model of the infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, muscle necrosis occurs concomitantly with significant vascular damage, which limits the migration of inflammatory cells. A significant increase in cytokines that promote inflammation explains the presence of inflammatory infiltrate; however, an impaired IFN&#x03B3; expression, a reduced number of Ml macrophages, a deficient phagocytic activity, and the prolongation of the permanence of inflammatory cells, lead to deficient muscle regeneration. The expression of TGF&#x03B2;1 and the consequent accumulation of collagen in the muscle, likely contribute to the fibrosis observed 30 days after infection. These results provide new information on the pathogenesis of gas gangrene caused by <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, shed light on the basis of the poor muscle regenerative activity, and may open new perspectives for the development of novel therapies for patients suffering this disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Muscle regeneration after myonecrosis occurs in three sequential and interrelated phases: inflammation, regeneration, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). Initially, cellular damage is associated with the entry of extracellular calcium that induces a series of degenerative events, including hypercontraction, mitochondrial alterations and the activation of calcium-dependent proteases, leading to necrosis of the myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Turner and Badylak, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the disruption of the sarcolemma results in an increase in serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), a protein normally restricted to the myofiber cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karalaki et al. 2009</xref>). The presence of necrotic fibers activates the inflammatory response and then an influx of specific cells of the immune system occurs in the damaged muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). Inflammation is a critical component of the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). Injured muscle fibers activate the synthesis and release of a plethora of signaling molecules into the extracellular space, and these mediators induce the sequential attraction and activation of diverse cell populations that promote muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karalaki et al., 2009</xref>). The vascular network has an important role in skeletal muscle regeneration as it has an impact on the distribution of recruited inflammatory cells, regeneration-related factors (growth factors, cytokines, chemokines), as well as nutrients. Therefore alterations in vascular integrity can affect the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guti&#x00E9;rrez et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Muscle regeneration begins with the activation of satellite cells (SC) that reside on the surface of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Following muscle damage, some SC proliferate and differentiate whereas others return to quiescence as reserve population of myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Postmitotic precursor cells derived from activated SC then form multinucleated myotubes and proceed through a stage of regeneration that is dominated by terminal differentiation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). When the formation of contractile muscle fibers is complete, the size of the newly formed myofibers increases and the nucleus is displaced to the periphery of the fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karalaki et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Remodeling is a process in which the maturation and functional performance of regenerated myofibers occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). The final phase of the regenerative process is characterized by the remodeling of connective tissue, angiogenesis, and functional recovery of injured skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). After muscle injury, the extracellular matrix is remodeled, resulting in the overproduction of several types of collagen that contribute to the formation of a scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>); however, the overproduction of collagens within the damaged area could lead to excessive scarring and loss of muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). The transforming growth factor &#x03B2;1 (TGF&#x03B2;1) has been identified as a key factor in the activation of the fibrosis cascade in injured skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). The processes of neovascularization and reinnervation play a critical role in determining the regeneration potential of the injured muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Turner and Badylak, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The influx of inflammatory cells to the site of muscle damage is paramount for efficient regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chazaud et al., 2003</xref>). The inflammatory response during the early stages of muscle regeneration is temporally and spatially coupled to the initial stages of myogenesis, when SC are activated and initiate their proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) (Ly6C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) are the first inflammatory cells to invade the damaged muscle. The intramuscular density of these cells increases on the first six hours after the muscular damage, reaching a peak 24 h after the injury and then gradually returning to normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karalaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). PMN are essential for microbicidal action and for attracting other leucocytes capable of resolving inflammation and mediating the regeneration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Filippo et al., 2008</xref>). Resident tissue macrophages (F4/80<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, LY 6C<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) promote a marked flow of PMN through the release of the main chemoattractants for the recruitment of PMN, such as the murine chemokine keratinocyte chemo attractant (KC or CXCL1) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2 or CXCL2). PMN initiate the process of removal of necrotic myofibers and cellular debris by phagocytosis and by the rapid release of high concentrations of free radicals and proteases (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Badylack, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, PMN secrete proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate the arrival of macrophages, further promoting tissue inflammation (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Badylack, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Two distinct populations of macrophages sequentially invade the damaged muscle tissue. A population of phagocytic macrophages CD68<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/ CD163<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/F4/80<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (M1 macrophages) closely follow the invasion of PMN, reaching their maximum concentration approximately two days after the injury, and subsequently decreasing in number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>). The Th1 response is characterized by the presence of interleukin-1 (IL1&#x03B2;), interleukin-2 (IL2), interferon-&#x03B3; (IFN&#x03B3;) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x03B1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tidball, 2008</xref>). In turn, the M1 macrophages that produce TNF&#x03B1; and IL1&#x03B2; are capable of damaging the host tissue by releasing oxygen-free radicals that can damage cell membranes, phagocytose the necrotic muscle and promote the proliferation of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Badylack, 2012</xref>). The Th2 response involves high levels of interleukin-4 (IL4), interleukin-5 (IL5), interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin-10 (IL10) and interleukin-13 (IL13), which have anti-inflammatory effects and deactivate M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tidball, 2008</xref>). Additionally, IL4, IL10, and IL13 play well-characterized roles in the activation of non-phagocytic macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tidball, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tidball and Villalta, 2010</xref>). The non-phagocytic macrophages CD68<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/CD163<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/F480<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/206<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, known as M2 macrophages, invade the muscle and reach their maximum peak approximately four days after injury, but the number of these cells remains elevated in the damaged muscle by periods of up to two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>). M2 macrophages express high levels of IL10 and low levels of IL12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>). These tissue-remodeling macrophages decrease the inflammatory response and promote angiogenesis, as well as myoblast proliferation, growth, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carosio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Badylack, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Stimulation by IFN&#x03B3; is essential for the classic activation of the Th1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tidball, 2008</xref>). IFN&#x03B3; is also a powerful activator of PMN and M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Although IFN&#x03B3; is usually a product of &#x0022;natural killer&#x0022; cells and T cells, it could also be expressed by M1 macrophages having an autocrine role in their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the stimulation of IFN&#x03B3; can increase the response of PMN to chemotactic cytokines, potentially increasing their invasion to the sites of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>TNF&#x03B1; is another Th1 cytokine highly expressed by M1 macrophages. TNF&#x03B1; in the muscle reaches its peak approximately 24 h after the onset of damage, which coincides with the invasion of PMN and M1 macrophages, and with the increase in secondary muscle damage generated by myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>). Part of myeloid cell-mediated damage to muscle fibers is caused by nitric oxide (NO) derived from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and TNF&#x03B1; can stimulate M1 macrophages to elevate iNOS expression and thus promote further damage to muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tidball, 2011</xref>). The potential of TNF&#x03B1; to promote muscle repair and regeneration lies in its direct action on muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important factor that influences the muscle regeneration process is TGF&#x03B2;1, which has been recognized as a modulator of myoblast activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Charg&#x00E9; and Rudnicki, 2004</xref>). In general, TGF&#x03B2;1 plays a negative role in the regulation of myogenesis; it is highly expressed in quiescent SC and represses the progress of the cell cycle in these cells repressing the expression of MyoD and myogenin. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Gas gangrene induced by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> is an acute and life threatening infection associated either to trauma or surgery and is characterized by fever, sudden onset of prominent pain, the accumulation of gas at the site of infection, massive local edema and a severe myonecrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Stevens and Bryant, 2017</xref>). When there is an anaerobic environment adequate for clostridial growth after the introduction of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> in a deep lesion or in a surgical wound, bacteria begin to multiply and the destruction of the muscle spreads within few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Stevens and Bryant, 2017</xref>). In mice, intramuscular injection of 10<sup>6</sup> wild type <italic>C. perfringens</italic> vegetative cells leads to a limited sublethal infection characterized by swelling and myonecrosis. In this work this model was used to characterize the regeneration process after skeletal muscle damage induced by this bacterium.</p>

<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>For histological analysis, groups of 3 mice were injected with 1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> CFU of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> JIR325 or with sterile PBS. Animals were sacrificed in the phase of muscle damage at 1, 5, and 24 h post infection, and in times that cover the various steps in the process of muscle regeneration, i.e., 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 d post infection. The injected gastrocnemius muscles were dissected out and placed in a zinc fixative solution (calcium acetate 3 mM, zinc acetate 27 mM, zinc chloride 36 mM, Tris buffer 0.1 M, pH 7.4), for at least 48 h at 4&#x00B0;C. The dissected muscles were dehydrated in ethanol, placed in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Three non-consecutive sections of 4 &#x03BC;m were obtained from the mid region of each muscle and placed in glass slides. Sections were deparaffinated in xylene, hydrated in distilled water and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The microscopic evaluation was performed in an OLYMPUS BX51 microscope. Images of total muscle were captured from each section using an Evolution MP camera (Media Cybernetics, USA) and analyzed using the image analysis software Image Pro 6.3 (Media Cybernetics, USA). The necrotic area was estimated in samples collected 24 h post infection, considering the percentage of the area observed corresponding to damage and hypercontracted fibers. Areas of regeneration and of lack of regeneration were estimated in samples collected 14, and 30 d post infection; areas of regeneration corresponded to the percentage of the examined area characterized by the presence of regenerating fibers (fibers with centrally located nuclei), while non-regenerative areas were defined as the percentage of the examined area corresponding to cell debris and fibrotic muscle, while The diameters of regenerating fibers were determined in sections of muscles collected 30 d post infection.</p>

<title>A sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> induces myonecrosis</title>
<p><italic>C. perfringens</italic> is an anaerobic bacterium that induces gas gangrene, a devastating disease characterized by severe myonecrosis. Gas gangrene often occurs when vegetative or bacterial spores infect traumatic or chirurgical wounds and proliferate. We have previously shown that an intramuscular inoculum of 6&#x00D7;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> induces myonecrosis, as evidenced by a rapid release of CK into the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Monturiol-Gross, 2012</xref>). In this work, it was found that an inoculum of 1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> CFU of this bacterium also induces a significant increase in plasma CK 5 h after infection (p&#x003C;0.01), although at 24h postinfection the plasma CK activity showed no significant difference compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicating that the infection was controlled by the immune system and that the process of myonecrosis was limited in time. Histological analysis of the infected muscle showed areas of myonecrosis characterized by hyaline myofibrillar material and hypercontraction of myofibers since 5 h post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Bacterial aggregates were evident between the muscle fibers whereas the inflammatory infiltrate was distributed in a non-homogeneous way in the muscle, without accumulation of PMN inside the venules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Accordingly, it was previously reported that the inhibition of chemotaxis at the site of infection by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> depends on the size of the inoculum, and thus a sublethal inoculum does not effectively inhibit the inflammatory infiltrate into the infected muscle; moreover, the immune system is able to control the infection, inhibiting the establishment of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">O&#x2019;Brien et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, our model of a sublethal inoculum of the bacteria allowed us to study the development of the muscle regenerative response.</p>

<title>A sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> impairs the muscle regeneration process</title>
<p>To characterize the process of muscle regeneration, a histological analysis of the infected muscles was performed 7 d post infection. At this time, the presence of regenerative myofibers, characterized by central nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), near or within a fibrous matrix, was observed. In addition, cellular detritus from necrotic fibers had not been removed despite the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate even at 14 and 30 d post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Although a portion of the damaged muscle was regenerated, when determining the size of the regenerative fibers it was observed that it differs significantly from the size of the fibers in control muscles at 30 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). While in the controls 44.5 &#x00B1; 2.8&#x0025; of the fibers had a diameter between 30-39 &#x03BC;m, in the muscles infected with <italic>C. perfringens</italic> 48.1 &#x00B1; 5.4&#x0025; of the fibers had a diameter between 10-19 &#x03BC;m. Moreover, 5.0 &#x00B1; 2.4&#x0025; of the regenerative cells in the infected muscles corresponded to fibers with a small diameter between 1-9 &#x03BC;m, indicating poor regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Another characteristic of poor regeneration is the replacement of muscle fibers by fibrous tissue. Specific stain for collagen fibers was made with Syrian Red. Red areas (indicative of collagen deposition) around small regenerative cells were evident 7 d post infection in the damaged muscle. These areas remained over time and showed greater intensity at 14 d and 30 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>) after the muscle injury. When performing a quantitative analysis at 30 d, the control showed only 3.1 &#x00B1; 0.5&#x0025; of collagenous material in the total area, while in the muscles infected with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, 23.5 &#x00B1; 5.6&#x0025; of the muscle corresponded to collagen deposition, which represents a significant difference between both groups (p &#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, the poor muscle regenerative outcome in this model correlates with an increased collagen deposition, underscoring the substitution of muscle fibers by a fibrotic matrix.</p>

<title>A sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> alters capillary vessels and nerves in the infected muscle</title>
<p>To determine whether the infection with <italic>C. perfringens</italic> damages the vasculature, an immunostaining was performed with antibodies specific for the endothelial growth factor receptor Flk-1. At 6 h after the infection, a decrease in the number of capillary vessels was evident, and approximately 75&#x0025; of the vessels were damaged 24 h after the infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The lack of capillary vessels was observed mainly in areas of myonecrosis 6 h and 1 d after the infection; in addition, the structures that showed a positive staining signal in these areas were smaller than those of the control samples, highlighting that they were probably non-functional capillary vessels or endothelial cell debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>When the capillary vessels were quantified by area of tissue, the control showed an average of 805.3 &#x2014; 43.8 capillaries per mm<sup>2</sup>, while in the muscles affected by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> the number decreased significantly to 201.3 &#x00B1; 51.5 capillaries per mm<sup>2</sup> at 6 h (p&#x003C;0.05) and 203 &#x00B1; 52.9 capillaries per mm<sup>2</sup> at 24 h post infection (p&#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when reporting the ratio of capillaries per muscle fiber, while the control showed an average of 1.14 &#x00B1; 0.13 capillaries per muscle fiber, in the infected muscles the average significantly dropped to 0.37 &#x00B1; 0.09 at 6 h (p&#x003c;0.05) and to 0.30 &#x00B1; 0.05 at 24 h post infection (p&#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the significant decrease in the density of capillary vessels in early times after infection, at 30 d there were no significant differences in the number of capillaries per area or muscle tissue when compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>), and they were evident even in the fibrotic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>), suggesting a revascularization process. However, it is likely that the early disruption of the microvascular network in the infected muscle affects the process of regeneration, since key steps in muscle regeneration requiring an intact vascular supply occur within the first hours after myonecrosis. Muscle healing is critically affected by the ischemia associated with a deficient blood supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kotwal and Chien 2017</xref>). The most critical consequence of ischemia is a decrease in cellular energy supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kotwal and Chien 2017</xref>), as energy is required for every aspect of the wound-healing process such as protein synthesis, cell migration and proliferation, membrane transport, and growth factor production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kotwal and Chien 2017</xref>). In these circumstances, the observed revascularization process may have occurred at a time when the muscle regenerative process had been already impaired.</p>
<p>Regarding the alteration of the nerves in the muscle, the antibody used against the neurofilament of the axons allowed their detection by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). A decreased number of nerves was observed 3 d after infection with <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (1.66 &#x00B1; 0.27 nerves per mm<sup>2</sup>), when compared with the control (3.16 &#x00B1; 0.11 nerves per mm<sup>2</sup>) (p&#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition, a decreased number of axons within the nerves was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>); while in the control muscle the average was 17.03 &#x00B1; 1.28 axons per 1000 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>, in the affected muscles it decreased significantly to 6.72 &#x00B1; 1.07 axons per 1000 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup> (p&#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Despite the damage observed 3 d post infection, when the samples were analyzed 30 d after muscle injury no significant differences were found in relation to the controls for the number of nerves per area nor for the number of axons per 1000 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Hence, a reinnervation process ensued in the muscle after the initial damage.</p>

The expression of TNF&#x03B1; also showed a significant increase from 6 h on (p&#x003C;0.05) and remained elevated for at least 48 h post infection (p&#x003C;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Furthermore, a significant increase in the expression of IL10 was observed in comparison to controls from 1d (p&#x003C;0.01) up to 6 d (p&#x003C;0.05), reaching a maximum peak 24 h after infection with the bacteria (p&#x003C;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>). When immunoassays were carried out to quantify various cytokines in the muscle, confirmatory results were obtained since IL1&#x03B2; remained high for at least 48 h post infection, IL6 increased significantly from 6 to 48 h post infection (p&#x003C;0.01), reaching maximum level at 6 h, while the TNF&#x03B1; reached a maximum level 48 h post infection (p&#x003C;0.01). In contrast, IFN&#x03B3; showed only a significant increase at transcriptional level 6 h post infection (p&#x003C;0.01), but not at the protein level (data not shown).</p>
<p>There was not a significant difference in the expression of IL4 between infected mice and controls, whereas for IL13, there was a significant difference only at 6 d post infection (p&#x003C;0.05) (data not shown). On the other hand, IL10 showed a significant increase 2 d after infection (p &#x003C;0.05) and the amount of protein remained slightly higher than controls until 6 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.7B</xref>).</p>
<p>The chemokines MIP2 and KC showed a significant increase in expression in comparison with controls from 6 h to 48 h post infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (p&#x003C;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). KC highest expression occurred 6 h post infection (maximum peak) and remained high even at 48 h. MCP-1 highest expression occurred 6 h post infection, although it decreased 24 h post infection and increased again at 48 h; its expression was significantly higher than that observed in the controls in all the evaluated times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the TGF&#x03B2;1 has been associated with fibrosis in the process of muscle regeneration, its gene expression and protein concentration were analyzed. A bimodal behavior was shown for TGF &#x03B2;1 both at the transcriptional and protein levels. When the relative mRNA expression was analyzed, a significant increase was observed one day after infection (p&#x003C;0.05) in relation to the control, its expression decreased at 2 d but increased again at 3 d (p &#x003C;0.01), remaining elevated at least until 6 d post infection (p &#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9A</xref>).</p>

<title>A sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> alters the influx of PMN and macrophages to the infected muscle</title>
<p>PMN are the first cells that reach the muscle after a myonecrosis, and are followed by M1 and M2 macrophages before the resolution of muscle damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). In injuries induced by a lethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, the absence of inflammatory cells in the infected muscle and the presence of PMN attached to the endothelium due to the overexpression of adhesion molecules has been reported (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Stevens and Bryant, 2002</xref>). However, when using a sublethal inoculum of this bacterium, an inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the muscle, with the presence of PMN, both aggregated and dispersed in the necrotic muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10A</xref>). The presence of PMN was evident 5 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10A</xref>), when they reached a number of 505.2 &#x00B1; 38 cells per mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10B</xref>). At 24 h their number was 548.4 &#x00B1; 56.40 cells per mm<sup>2</sup>, at 3 d 342.2 &#x00B1; 36.57 cells per mm<sup>2</sup>, and at 5 d after infection numbers dropped to 81.68 &#x00B1; 9.87 cells per mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figs. 10A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10B</xref>). These observations agree with the described pattern of early neutrophil influx as the first wave of inflammatory cells in injured tissues.</p>

<p>M1 macrophages immunostained with anti-iNOS were poorly detected during the study period.

<p>Little influx of M1 macrophages (iNOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) in the muscle of the infected animals was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figs. 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">B</xref>), which suggests alterations in this population of inflammatory cells after infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens.</italic> This could be due to the observed absence of IFN-&#x03B3;. Accordingly, in experiments in which IFN&#x03B3; signaling has been blocked in injured muscles, there is a reduction in the expression in macrophages of transcripts that indicate the activation of the M1 phenotype, such as iNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). The classical inflammation response after a tissue injured occurs within the following 5 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Novak and Koh, 2013</xref>). Normal remodeling in muscle is very dependent on the timing of the M1 and M2 macrophages response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chazaud, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). The transition to M2 macrophages is critical to muscle regeneration, and prolonged inflammation results in fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chazaud, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>IL10, IL4 and IL13 have defined roles in the activation of M2 macrophages, which constitute a complex population comprising several subpopulations with functional and molecular specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mantovani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tidball and Villalta, 2010</xref>). M2a macrophages are activated by IL4 and IL13, secrete IL10, express arginase 1, and promote wound healing and muscle regeneration, while M2b are activated by immune complexes or Toll-like receptors, and release anti-inflammatory cytokines associated with the Th2 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tidball and Villalta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rigamonti, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, M2c macrophages are activated by IL10, release cytokines that deactivate the M1 phenotype, promote the proliferation of nonmyeloid cells, and influence the deposition of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tidball and Villalta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). Hence, the dynamics of cytokine synthesis in the affected muscle greatly determines the appearance and action of various populations of macrophages in a complex tissue landscape which, in turn, greatly determines the outcome of the regenerative process. Macrophages play a central role in the natural wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Juban and Chazaud, 2017</xref>). They direct T-cell activation, promoting stem cell and progenitor cell migration, activating angiogenic responses, and guiding extracellular matrix remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Castiglioni et al., 2015</xref>). They phagocytose cellular debris generated during tissue remodeling, recycling important molecular components to be reused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Juban and Chazaud, 2017</xref>). The phenotype of the macrophages can have profound influences on the progression of disease or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Juban and Chazaud, 2017</xref>). The same macrophage can switch between pro-inflammatory and pro-healing states depending on the surrounding environmental cues, and the switch from the M1 to the M2 phenotype occurs in stages in response to upregulation of IL-4 and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Juban and Chazaud, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recruited monocytes fail to differentiate adequately in tissue remodeling, in muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Villalta et al. 2009</xref>), insulin resistance (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Olefsky and Glass 2010</xref>), and advanced age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mahbub et al. 2012</xref>) leading to unsuccessful remodeling and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carvalho et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Villalta et al. 2011a</xref>, <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Similar to muscular dystrophies, muscle loss due to aging is likely caused by a prolonged inflammatory response, characterized by a higher expression of IL-1&#x03B2;. If the M1 response lasts too long, the new tissue is highly fibrotic, leading to a decreased function. In myonecrosis induced by a subletal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> altered muscle regeneration was observed in association to both a delayed recruitment of macrophages at the site of infection and an altered production of cytokines.</p>
<p>After infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, a significant increase in the gene expression level of IL10 in the muscle was observed from 1 d (maximum peak) to 6 d after infection, and at the protein level since 2 d (maximum peak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">B</xref>). Although no significant changes were detected in the expression of IL4, for IL13 an increase in gene expression level was observed after 6 d (data not shown). The influx of both M1 and M2 macrophages into the infected muscle was observed since the first day post infection. The presence of M1 macrophages in the infected muscle was scarce, having its maximum peak by 3 d whereas M2 mecrophages were more abundant than M1 in the infected muscle, having its maximum peak by 7 d and remaining high even after 14 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11B</xref>). The altered arrival of M1 and M2 macrophages into the infected muscle after infection in our model is likely to alter the muscle regeneration process.</p>
<p>When analyzing the arrival and permanence of the different cell populations using a sublethal dose of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> vis-&#x00E0;-vis the typical inflammatory response reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. 12</xref>), there is a prolongation of the inflammatory response in the <italic>C. perfringens</italic> model. The PMN remain in the infected muscle up to 5 d, which is complemented with a high expression of proinflammatory cytokines for up to at least 2 d. In addition, there is a limited arrival of M1 macrophages which remain within the infected muscle for longer time span than expected. It is proposed that given the absence of IFN&#x03B3; in the acute phase of infection, the number and activity of M1 macrophages were affected. One possible explanation for this could be an altered function of PMN due to the direct effect of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> toxins in these cells. It has been reported that perfringolysin O (PFO) induces cytotoxicity in PMN (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Stevens and Bryant, 2002</xref>) and, <italic>C. perfringens</italic> phospholipase C (CpPLC) interferes in the replacement of mature PMN in the peripheral circulation, inhibiting their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Takehara et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the vascular damage caused by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> infection could also contribute to prevente the influx of cells of the inflammatory response. Thus, the direct and indirect effects of the infection with <italic>C. perfringens</italic> on inflammatory cells results in evident consequences in the regenerative response.</p>

<p>After a muscle injury, the regeneration process is mediated by a specific type of stem cells, the SC, but also involves the interaction of these myogenic cells with other resident cells, inflammatory cells, blood vessels, nerves and the extracellular matrix (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Ciciliot and Schiaffino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hern&#x00E1;ndez et al., 2011</xref>). There are at least three basic requirements for the process of muscle regeneration to occur: a) an adequate blood flow in the regenerative muscle; b) innervation of regenerative cells; and c) permanence of the basal lamina around the necrotic muscle fibers, which serves as a scaffold and substrate for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guti&#x00E9;rrez et al., 2018</xref>). Impairment of any of these contributory factors results in a defective muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>The importance of blood flow lies, on one hand, in the inflow of inflammatory infiltrate to the site of the lesion and, in addition, to the provision of oxygen and nutrients and ATP to the regenerating muscle. When vascular density was analyzed after an infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic>, it was observed that the microvasculature is affected in the first hours after infection, a time that coincides with the arrival of PMN, the first inflammatory cells present in the infected muscle. Although the presence of the inflammatory infiltrate is evident, the vascular damage and the direct effect of CpPLC and PFO on cells of the immune system can affect the migration of inflammatory cells to the area of damage, which results in the deficient removal of necrotic debris. Thus, the combination of a direct inhibitory action of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> toxins, added to the disruption of the microvascular network, is likely to affect the timely arrival of inflammatory cells. It has been reported that disturbances that affect the removal of dead cells delay the process of muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). This may be due to the fact that the persistence of cellular debris becomes a physical obstacle for muscle regeneration.</p>
<p>Another consequence of the damage to the vascular system in the regenerative process is the limitation in the available oxygen, which is critical for muscle healing. Hypoxia can also promote the proliferation of bacteria and the further development of gas gangrene, hence generating a vicious cycle (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Flores-D&#x00ED;az and Alape Gir&#x00F3;n, 2003</xref>). In studies carried out with snake venoms, the alteration of the microvasculature affects the regenerative process, favoring the replacement of muscle by fibrotic muscle; moreover, regenerative fibers have small diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guti&#x00E9;rrez et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arce et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hern&#x00E1;ndez et al., 2011</xref>). Although our findings showed that the capillary density is restored at 30 d, it is possible that the severe blood vessel damage induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> in the first hours after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) could be one of the causes behind the impaired regenerative process.</p>
<p>Innervation is another requirement for a successfull muscle regeneration process. The proliferation and fusion of myogenic cells occur in muscles that regenerate in the absence of nerves and in those in which the nerves are intact (Slater and <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Schiaffino, 2008</xref>). However, although the initial events of the muscle regeneration process can occur in the absence of innervation, the latter is required for the growth and recovery of muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kalhovde et al., 2005</xref>; Slater and <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Schiaffino, 2008</xref>). In the absence of innervation, regenerating cells do not reach their maturity. In the model, although the density and structure of the nerves were affected with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> 3 d after infection, innervation was recovered at 30 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Consequently, innervation does not appear to be a cause of poor regeneration after muscle damage generated by <italic>C. perfringens.</italic> However, the question remains as to whether <italic>C. perfringens</italic> toxins induce damage at the synaptic level and neuromuscular transmission, as has been reported for the lethal toxin of <italic>Clostridium sordelii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbier et al., 2004</xref>). For a successful muscle regeneration process, scaffolding is required to maintain the position of the muscle fibers.</p>
<p>The processes of muscle necrosis and regeneration involve a complex turnover of the extracellular matrix, which is determinant for an effective regenerative response. The process of matrix deposition after myonecrosis, although initially beneficial, affects the regenerative process if it continues without control, resulting in the permanent accumulation of collagen around the myofibers, which may even lead to muscle replacement by fibrous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Serrano and Mu&#x00F1;oz-C&#x00E1;noves, 2010</xref>). Fibroblasts contribute to the formation of fibrous muscle by the production and accumulation of components of the extracellular matrix, such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycans and interstitial collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Serrano and Mu&#x00F1;oz-C&#x00E1;noves, 2010</xref>). When the histological sections of animals infected with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> were analyzed, it was observed that at 30 d, almost 25&#x0025; of the muscle area corresponded to collagen accumulated in areas where the regenerative process was deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This may be associated with the overexpression of some mitogenic chemokines and cytokines, produced by macrophages and PMN, which are also involved in the mechanism of fibrogenesis. It has been reported that MCP-1 is a profibrotic mediator, whose neutralization reduces the extent of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deshmane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wynn, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Experimental models of fibrosis have documented potent antifibrotic properties for cytokines associated with the Th1 response such as IFN&#x03B3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wynn, 2008</xref>); thus, the absence of this cytokine in our study model could be associated with overproduction of extracellular matrix. On the other hand, IL10 and TGF&#x03B2; activate a subpopulation of M2 macrophages that promotes the deposition of extracellular matrix and fibrosis in different pathogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Serrano and Mu&#x00F1;oz-C&#x00E1;noves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball, 2017</xref>). TGF&#x03B2; has been associated with the development of fibrosis in a number of diseases as it is one of the main activators of macrophages and fibroblasts; of the three isotypes of TGF&#x03B2; in mammals, muscle fibrosis is mainly attributed to the TGF&#x03B2;1 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yoshimura et al.2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wynn, 2008</xref>). In this work an increase of TGF&#x03B2;1 was evidenced both in early and late time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>), and hence may be related to the collagen accumulation evidenced since 7 d.</p>
<p>IFN&#x03B3; has a relevant function in muscle regeneration, since this molecule directly regulates myogenic cells in their differentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tidball et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the alterations in the regenerative response observed in this study could also be a consequence of the absence of IFN&#x03B3;. In general, infection with a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> stimulates the expression of chemoattractants and cytokines that stimulate the arrival of different inflammatory cells at the site of the lesion. However, it has been previously reported that the bacterium generates toxins capable of directly affecting PMN and macrophages and, as a consequence, their function is altered. Additionally, the recruitment of M1 macrophages to the site of infection was affected by the lack of IFN&#x03B3;. On the other hand, the bacterium generates damage at the level of the microvasculature and, as a consequence, affects the migration of the phagocytes into the damaged muscle. The alteration of the influx of the different inflammatory cells leads to a deficient cell debris removal of The above observations, coupled with the release of factors that stimulate the overproduction of collagen such as TGF&#x03B2;1, result in poor muscle regeneration, characterized by fibrosis and small regenerative fibers.</p>
<p>Although muscle regeneration is highly efficient in many clinical and experimental models, provided basic requirements are fulfilled, muscle regeneration after myonecrosis induced by a sublethal inoculum of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> is deficient probably due to altered events in the initial phases following injury, which are critical and influence the overall outcome of the regeneration process. The inflammatory response induced by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> is characterized by alterations in the early influx of inflammatory cells, mainly PMN, macrophages M1 and M2 to the site of infection. These cells remain in the muscle for prolonged periods of time and are likely to be functionally impaired. In the case of M1 macrophages, their limited recruitment is possibly due to the low levels of INF&#x03B3; produced. Our findings highlight several aspects of the regenerative muscle response which are affected in the experimental model of gas gangrene used. Understanding the mechanisms of the inflammatory and regenerative response in the muscle after infection by <italic>C. perfringens</italic> could be crucial for understanding the bases behind such poor regenerative response and for devising innovative therapeutic strategies for this drastic muscular pathology.</p>
