<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Patients with uncontrolled diabetes are susceptible to implant failure due to impaired bone metabolism. Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1&#x03B1; (HIF-1&#x03B1;), a transcription factor that is up-regulated in response to reduced oxygen condition during the bone repair process after fracture or osteotomy, is known to mediate angiogenesis and osteogenesis. However, its function is inhibited under hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of exogenous HIF-1&#x03B1; on bone formation around implants by applying HIF-1&#x03B1; to diabetic mice via a novel PTD-mediated DNA delivery system. Smooth surface implants (1mm in diameter; 2mm in length) were placed in the both femurs of diabetic and normal mice. HIF-1&#x03B1; and placebo gels were injected to implant sites of the right and left femurs, respectively: Normal mouse with HIF-1&#x03B1; gel (NH), Normal mouse with placebo gel (NP), Diabetic mouse with HIF-1&#x03B1; gel (DH), and Diabetic mouse with placebo gel (DP). RNA sequencing was performed 4 days after surgery. Based on RNA sequencing, Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified and HIF-1&#x03B1; target genes were selected. Histologic and histomorphometric results were evaluated 2 weeks after the surgery. The results showed that bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone volume (BV) were significantly greater in the DH group than the DP group (p &#x003C; 0.05). A total of 216 genes were differentially expressed in DH group compared to DP group. On the other hand, there were 95 DEGs in the case of normal mice. Twenty-one target genes of HIF-1&#x03B1; were identified in diabetic mice through bioinformatic analysis of DEGs. Among the target genes, <italic>NOS2, GPNMB, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16</italic> and <italic>TRIM63</italic> were manually found to be associated with wound healing-related genes. In conclusion, local administration of HIF-1&#x03B1; via PTD may help bone formation around the implant and induce gene expression more favorable to bone formation in diabetic mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental implant has become an efficient and predictable treatment for replacing missing teeth. The number of implants placed in the United States has been steadily increasing at 12#x0025; annually, with improvements in implant materials, designs, and surgical techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Despite its high success rate of 95&#x0025; in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], certain risk factors may predispose individuals to implant failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Among various patient-related risk factors, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, has been considered a relative contraindication to dental implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Implant success is highly dependent on osseointegration, a process in which bone and implant surface become structurally and functionally integrated without interposition of non-bone tissue layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Osseointegration involves bone repair and remodeling and critically affects implant stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, the hyperglycemic condition of diabetes inhibits osteoblastic differentiation, mineralization, and adherence of extra cellular matrix and stimulates bone resorption, consequently interfering with wound healing and bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Previous experimental studies have reported decreased bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and delayed new bone formation around the implant in diabetic animal models, proving that hyperglycemia impairs osseointegration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that chronic high glucose level results in defective responses of tissues to hypoxic conditions by impairing the function of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1&#x03B1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Transcription factor HIF-1&#x03B1; is up-regulated in response to reduced oxygen conditions and influences numerous target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), which are known to be associated with angiogenesis and osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. HIF-1&#x03B1;, which is well known to play a pivotal role in wound healing, is stabilized against degradation and transactivates under hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>A study carried out by Zou et al. demonstrated that osteogenesis and angiogenesis were enhanced around implants with the up-regulation of HIF-1&#x03B1; in rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in animal models. In addition, previous studies investigating effects of HIF-1&#x03B1; on bone regeneration showed that functions of osteoblasts and chondrocytes are directly regulated by HIF-1&#x03B1; during bone fracture healing in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. As many studies have associated malfunction of HIF-1&#x03B1; in diabetic animal models with delayed bone recovery, attempts have been made to improve bone healing by applying HIF-1&#x03B1;. However, application of HIF-1&#x03B1; using mesenchymal stem cells to increase expression of HIF-1&#x03B1; is limited by its inefficiency and long preparation period. To maximize efficiency of delivery to the implant site, a PTD-mediated DNA delivery system was used in this study. PTDs are short peptides efficiently transporting various proteins, nucleic acids, and nanoparticles into cells across the plasma membranes. This protein-based strategy is a remarkable method for delivering target DNA to the nucleus because of its low toxicity and high transduction efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that overexpression of HIF-1&#x03B1; induced by PTD-mediated DNA delivery system resulted in increased expression of VEGF and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, taking advantage of the fact that PTD can deliver HIF-1&#x03B1; into cell nuclei, we designed an experiment to determine whether local application of HIF-1&#x03B1; into the implanted sites by using PTD in the femur of diabetic mice enhances osseointegration compared with placebo controls. Using RNA sequencing and histomorphometric analysis, we observed new bone formation and significant changes in the expression of genes associated with wound healing.</p>

<title>Preparation of HIF-1&#x03B1; gene construct and Hph-1-GAL4 DNA binding domain protein</title>
<p>HIF-1&#x03B1; encoded plasmid and Hph-1-GAL4 DNA binding protein were provided by Sang-Kyou Lee&#x2019;s Laboratory at Yonsei University, Department of Biotechnology. The HIF-1&#x03B1; gene was inserted into pEGFP-N1 UAS plasmid containing five consensus GAL4 binding sites (UAS: CGGAGGACAGTACTCCG) (HIF-1&#x03B1;-UAS). The GAL4 DNA binding domain that encodes the DNA-interactive domain of yeast transcription factor GAL4 was cloned into pRSETB plasmid (Clonetech) expression vector containing Hph-1-PTD sequence (YARVRRRGPRP) at the N-terminus (Hph-1-GAL4-DBD). pRSETB plasmid with the Hph-1-GAL4 DNA binding domain was transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 star (DE3) pLysS strain (Invitrogen).

<title>Surgical procedure</title>
<p>Thirteen C57BL/6 mice (21 g) and thirteen C57BLKS/J-db/db mice (38 g) were given two weeks of acclimatization before surgery. Implant placing methods followed Xu et al. (Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009). The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Zoletil 50<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (30 mg/kg) and Rompun<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (10 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), the surgical site being shaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>) and disinfected with Betadine. An incision was made above both knee joints and the anterior-distal aspect of the femur was accessed using medial parapatellar arthrotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). Implant sites were prepared on the anterior-distal surface of the femur through sequential drilling with 0.5 mm, 0.9 mm round bur and 0.7 mm stainless steel twist drills with cooled sterile saline irrigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>). To effectively deliver HIF-1&#x03B1; to the implant site via local injection, gel phase materials were prepared as described previously. HIF-1&#x03B1; gel was injected to the preparation site and cancellous bone of the right femur, and placebo gel was injected to the same areas for the left femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>). When the gel hardened, pure titanium implants with a machined surface (1 mm in diameter; 2 mm in length; Shinhung, Seoul, Korea) were inserted into the undersized hole with mild pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2F</xref>). The muscles and skin were sutured independently to cover and stabilize the implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2H</xref>). Antibiotics were injected at fixed times daily for 3 days (Enrofloxacin 5mg/kg, twice a day; Meloxicam, 1mg/kg, once a day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Three C57BL/6 (21 g) and three C57BLKS/J-db/db (38 g) mice were sacrificed 4 days after the surgery for RNA sequencing, and ten mice from each strain were sacrificed two weeks after the surgery for histologic and histomorphometric analysis.</p>

<p>RNA purity was determined by assaying 1 &#x03BC;l of total RNA extract on a NanoDrop8000 spectrophotometer. Total RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) value greater than 8. mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (Illumina TruSeq RNA Prep Kit v2). mRNA was purified and fragmented from total RNA (1 ug) using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads using two rounds of purification. Cleaved RNA fragments primed with random hexamers were reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. The RNA template was removed and a replacement strand was synthesized to generate double-stranded (ds) cDNA. End repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, cDNA template purification and enrichment of the purified cDNA templates using PCR were then performed. The quality of the amplified libraries was verified by capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer, Agilent). After performing QPCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), we combined libraries that were index tagged in equimolar amounts in the pool. RNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500 system following the protocols provided for 2 x 75 sequencing.</p>
<p>Reads for each sample were mapped to the reference genome (mouse mm10) by Tophat (v2.0.13). The aligned results were added to Cuffdiff (v2.2.0) to report differentially expressed genes. Geometric and pooled methods were applied for library normalization and dispersion estimation.</p>
<p>Each group has three samples. Normal mice with HIF-1&#x03B1; gel (NH); Normal mice with placebo gel (NP); Diabetic mice with HIF-1&#x03B1; gel (DH); Diabetic mice with placebo gel (DP).</p>

<title>Identification of DEGs</title>
<p>Of the various Cuffdiff output files, &#x201C;gene&#x005F;exp.diff&#x2019; was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Two filtering processes were applied to detect DEGs between control and case groups. First, only genes having Cuffdiff status code &#x201C;OK&#x201D; were extracted. The status code indicates whether each condition contains enough reads in a locus for a reliable calculation of expression level, &#x201C;OK&#x201D; indicating that the test was successful in calculating gene expression level. For the second filtering, 2-fold change was calculated and only genes belonging to the following range were selected:

<title>Histologic and histomorphometric analysis</title>
<p>Ten mice from each strain (C57BL/6 (21 g) and C57BLKS/J-db/db (38 g)) were sacrificed at 2 weeks after implant surgery. Femurs from both sides were obtained and fixed at 10&#x0025; buffered formalin. After a week of fixation, they were embedded in light curing epoxy resin. The specimens were prepared with a cutting distance of 0.5 mm from the apical end of the implant. Sections were cut with a thickness of 50 um via grinding system, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x0026;E), and observed using light microscopy (Leica DM LB, Germany). IMT iSolution Lite ver 8.1<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (IMT i-Solution Inc., Canada) was used for histomorphometric measurement. BIC ratio was calculated as the linear percentage of direct BIC to the total surface of implants.

<title>Histologic analysis</title>
<p>In the NH group, abundant and smooth-lined mature bone formation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Mature and smooth-lined bone was also observed in the NP group, but in a lesser amount than in the NH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). In contrast, most of the implant surface in the DP group showed soft tissue attachment and abundant adipose tissue in surrounding areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>). Moreover, bone formation was irregular. In the DH group, many vascular sinusoids with red blood cells (RBC) were located around implants, and more bone formation and attachment around implant were observed than in the DP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). In addition, there was a tendency toward increased bone formation at the HIF-1&#x03B1; application site around implants. Bone marrow was filled with adipose tissue in areas distant from the application site.</p>

<p>Osseointegration was observed in all specimens of NH, NP, DH groups. One specimen of the DP group did not show osseointegration and was omitted from statistical analysis. All groups in this study demonstrated normality in parametric test (Shapiro-Wilk test). The BIC of HIF-1&#x03B1; treated groups was significantly higher than that of placebo groups in both normal and diabetic mice. There was no significant BIC difference between the NP and DH groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). Among diabetic mice, the DH group showed significantly greater BV than the DP group while the groups of normal mice did not show any significant differences in BV.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies reported that hyperglycemia, even in hypoxic condition, negatively affects the stability and activation of HIF-1&#x03B1; and inhibits the expression of target genes of HIF-1&#x03B1; which are critical to wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been reported that the exogenous increase of HIF-1&#x03B1; resulted in improved bone regeneration and osseointegration around the implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the exogenous increase of HIF-1&#x03B1; would improve bone regeneration because endogenous HIF-1&#x03B1; was supressed in a hyperglycemic environment and failed to function based on these previous results.</p>
<p>According to Lu et al., immature mesenchymal tissue first appeared in significant amounts 4 days after bone ablation. Abundant formation of new bone was seen after 6 days. After 10 days, bone entered maturation stage and the bone marrow continuously repeated the remodeling cycle without major changes in the matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Thus, specimens were obtained 2 weeks after the surgery to histologically evaluate mature bone in the healing process and estimate implant stability in each group.</p>
<p>In this study, histologic results show that adipose and soft tissue were more engaged in diabetic mice than in normal ones. Remarkably, most of the bone marrow in diabetic mice was composed of adipose tissue. In addition, the thickness and amount of bone were thinner and less in diabetic mice. Bone formation was highly irregular and fragile bone was also observed. The histological state of diabetic mice specimens was unfavorable for implant maintenance. These results were coincident with previous studies, which reported slower bone healing process in diabetic mice than normal mice as well as poorer biomechanical and histologic bone quality after initial healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Histomorphometric results showed that the DH group had greater bone contact and quantity than DP group. Based on histologic specimens, more vascular sinusoids were generated in those groups with HIF-1&#x03B1; application, demonstrating that HIF-1&#x03B1; increased the expression of VEGF and improved angiogenesis as in a previous study, in which HIF-1a was applied in the same way as this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. It is speculated that HIF-1&#x03B1;, which enhanced angiogenesis, also enhanced bone regeneration and increased BIC and BV levels. In addition, distant sites were full of adipose tissue compared to HIF-1a application sites near the implant, which consisted mainly of dense bone. The difference was even more evident in comparison with the DP group, in which tissue around the implant was filled with adipose tissue.</p>
<p>The success of HIF-1&#x03B1; transferrence into the cell nucleus via PTD delivery system in this study is confirmed by RNA sequencing, which reveals 201 up-regulated genes and 15 down-regulated genes in the DH group compared with the DP group. Thus, one may conclude that HIF-1&#x03B1; had been delivered to the intracellular space and functioned as intended. Because factors related to bone formation were mostly expressed 4 days after implant surgery, RNA sequencing was performed at that time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>21 target genes of HIF-1&#x03B1; out of 216 genes were selected through TRANSFAC<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> and 6 genes related to tissue healing or bone regeneration in diabetes were found manually, based on previously reported research: <italic>NOS2, GPNMB, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16, TRIM63</italic>. Functions of these genes are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Bioinformatic analysis showed that diabetic mice had 216 DEGs and 21 target genes whereas normal mice had 95 DEGs and 5 target genes. Moreover, the DEGs and target genes in normal mice were mostly included in those of diabetic mice. For example, 3 genes out of 5 genes besides TNF and CD274 were also included as target genes within diabetic mice. These results suggest that application of HIF-1&#x03B1;, suppressed in a hyperglycemic condition, activated expression of HIF-1&#x03B1; target genes. On the other hand, HIF-1&#x03B1; target genes were less activated in a normal condition because endogenous HIF-1&#x03B1; was already sufficiently expressed around injured tissue. As a consequence, it is assumed that when exogenous HIF-1&#x03B1; was provided, genes downstream of HIF-1&#x03B1; were more actively expressed in diabetic mice, which may account for the histomorphometric results of improved BIC and BV</p>
<p>In normal conditions, HIF-1&#x03B1; also improved BIC and BV, consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, HIF-1 a was more effective in diabetic mice in that the DH group showed significantly increased BIC and BV than DP while the NH group did not show a significant difference in BIC and BV compared to the NP group. Based on this result, it is assumed that exogenous HIF-1&#x03B1; worked more effectively in a hyperglycemic condition than normoglycemic.</p>
<p>Previous studies used mesenchymal stem cells to increase expression of HIF-1&#x03B1;, a process considered inefficient due to the long and complicated preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, the PTD-mediated DAN delivery system used in this study is a simple and efficient method for applying HIF-1&#x03B1; expression plasmid which can be easily produced in large quantities and can be injected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Moreover, the molecular complex containing Hph-1-GAL4-DBD and HIF-1&#x03B1;-UAS can be solidified into gel form for application to a local site without diffusion. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether the gel form releases HIF-1&#x03B1; ideally or not compared to liquid type. Moreover, future studies on higher mammals such as dogs and pigs may clarify the effects of HIF-1&#x03B1;.</p>
<p>Bone regeneration can be enhanced by applying bone morphogenetic factor (BMP), an osteogenic growth factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The administration of BMP has been reported to improve bone regeneration in numerous dental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. However, several complications associated with BMP treatment have been reported. Jeon demonstrated that BMP causes problems such as uncontrolled release rates, a short period of BMP release, and a high initial burst of release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. BMP also causes an unexpected immune reaction, spontaneous swelling of soft tissues, and difficulty in controlling diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. HIF-1&#x03B1; is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of VEGF to induce angiogenesis and mediates callus remodeling and ossification through osteogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. VEGF expression by HIF-1&#x03B1; promotes angiogenesis by increasing the proliferation, survival, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Based on this study, we would like to suggest that the use of angiogenic growth factors such as HIF-1 a rather than osteogenic growth factors like BMP could improve bone quality and quantity around the implant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Regenerative strategies for diabetic patients in oral implantology require intact healing of localized bone defects. The success of the therapeutic procedure depends primarily on overcoming dysfunctional angiogenesis and restoring osteogenesis under hyperglycemic conditions. Innovative strategies include PTD-mediated HIF-1&#x03B1; gene delivery into the implanted sites locally to increase HIF-1&#x03B1; levels, giving rise to a hyperglycemic environment that favors regeneration. The implementation of gene-forced expression of HIF-1&#x03B1; delivered via PTD in such strategies holds tremendous potential. Further study will determine the potential effectiveness of a local delivery system with PTD.</p>
