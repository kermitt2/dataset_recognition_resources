<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Offspring size is a fundamental trait in disparate biological fields of study. This trait can be measured as the size of plant seeds, animal eggs, or live young, and it influences ecological interactions, organism fitness, maternal investment, and embryonic development. Although multiple evolutionary processes have been predicted to drive the evolution of offspring size, the phylogenetic distribution of this trait remains poorly understood, due to the difficulty of reliably collecting and comparing offspring size data from many species. Here we present a database of 10,449 morphological descriptions of insect eggs, with records for 6,706 unique insect species and representatives from every extant hexapod order. The dataset includes eggs whose volumes span more than eight orders of magnitude. We created this database by partially automating the extraction of egg traits from the primary literature. In the process, we overcame challenges associated with large-scale phenotyping by designing and employing custom bioinformatic solutions to common problems. We matched the taxa in this database to the currently accepted scientific names in taxonomic and genetic databases, which will facilitate the use of this data for testing pressing evolutionary hypotheses in offspring size evolution.</p>

<title>Background &#x0026; summary</title>
<p>The size of a reproductive propagule, for example an animal egg or a plant seed, has crucial implications for the biology of both the parent and the offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. From the perspective of the parent organism, propagule size is a component of the maternal investment in each offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, and propagule size is predicted to be positively correlated with adult body size and negatively correlated with propagule number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. From the perspective of the offspring, the size of the propagule is relevant to the starting material for embryonic development, and it can impact both life history and ecological interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain patterns in the diversity of propagule size, yet the robustness or generality of the patterns themselves have rarely been tested across species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. To understand the evolutionary forces driving propagule size evolution, we need large-scale, reliable descriptions of the distribution of propagule size across the evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>Insect eggs come in an incredible diversity of shapes and sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The thousands of egg descriptions in the entomological literature, however, have never to our knowledge been systematically compiled across insects. Without a comparison of egg sizes across insects, we cannot ascertain basic information such as the extant range of insect egg sizes, or the relationship between size and ecology or development. To address this problem, we created a database of quantitative parameters describing egg morphology from the entomological literature. All data were collected from published records, including both measurements reported in text descriptions of insect eggs, as well as our own new measurements of published images. We developed custom software that allowed us to collect data from thousands of publications efficiently and reproducibly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We provide this software as a set of tools that can assist other scientists in collecting phenotypic data from the literature (see Methods).</p>
<p>Using this software we extracted egg descriptions from 1,756 publications from the past 250 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The database has 10,449 entries representing every extant order of insects, and 6,706 unique insect species. The insect egg database includes descriptions of egg size and shape (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), and the scientific name of each entry has been matched to current taxonomic and genetic databases. The egg database is made publicly available for download (see Methods).</p>

<p>Insect egg sizes vary between species, within species, and within a single individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and the database described here contains variation from all of these sources. We calculated the degree of intraspecific variation in egg length for all taxa where these data were available in the literature. We additionally assessed the variation in the precision used to record data for all database entries. This provides the necessary information to account for sources of variation in a comparative study of insect egg morphology.</p>
<p>The insect egg database includes representatives of all insect orders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), but these orders are not equivalent to each other either in terms of number of extant species or in the historical degree of entomological study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. We therefore assessed the phylogenetic coverage of the insect egg database relative to the number of species estimated for each clade. This enables evaluation of the potential bias present in the database, and highlights undersampled clades as potential priorities for future study.</p>
<p>The methods used to create the insect egg database include solutions to challenges in assembling phenotypic data from large groups of organisms. Phenotypic descriptions can require great resources and expertise to reliably collect, identify, and describe morphological features across thousands of species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This expense can limit macroevolutionary studies of morphological evolution. One way to overcome this barrier is to rely on the thousands of data points already reported by experts in the scientific literature. However, this method brings its own challenges, such as assigning concordance between taxonomic names and extracting data from published text or images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. To address these needs, we include bioinformatic approaches that can be used by future researchers. Both the egg database and the software solutions used to generate it will have broad value for researchers interested in studying questions of morphological evolution across large evolutionary scales.</p>

<title>Gathering primary literature with egg descriptions</title>
<p>The workflow used to assembling the database is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Publications were identified for potential inclusion in the egg database using the following online literature databases: Google Scholar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scholar.google.com">scholar.google.com</ext-link>), Web of Knowledge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webofknowledge.com">webofknowledge.com</ext-link>), and Harvard&#x2018;s HOLLIS library system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hollis.harvard.edu">hollis.harvard.edu</ext-link>). We searched these databases continuously during the period of from October 2015 &#x2013; August 2017 with a predetermined set of word pairs that included an insect common or taxonomic name (e.g. &#x2018;fly&#x2019;, &#x2018;Diptera&#x2019;, &#x2018;Nematocera&#x2019;) and one of the following egg related terms: &#x2018;egg&#x2019;, &#x2018;chorion&#x2019;, &#x2018;immature&#x2019;, or &#x2018;embryo&#x2019;. Insect clade names included all insect order names and all insect families from the five largest insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera). Following a search, all publications returned by the search were manually evaluated for inclusion in the database. The criteria for this evaluation were as follows: [1] Does the title or abstract of the paper suggest that the paper contains insect egg information? [2] If the publication could be immediately previewed on the Harvard library system, does it contain an egg measurement in the text or an egg image with a scale bar? [3] If the publication could not be immediately previewed, does the title or abstract refer to descriptions of the chorion, immature stages, or embryology? If a publication met at least one of these criteria, complete bibliographic information for the reference was stored in a master BibTeX reference file (available at Dryad <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/review?doi&#x003D;doi:10.5061/dryad.pv40d2r">https://datadryad.org/review?doi&#x003D;doi:10.5061/dryad.pv40d2r</ext-link>). Publications were continually added to the database throughout the study, and the final count of publications that met these criteria were 2,900, of which 1,756 contained egg morphological data. The language of the publication was not a criterion for inclusion in the database. However, due to the nature of the online search engines that we used, the database is enriched for papers published with at least an abstract in English. A formatted list of the references cited in the egg database is available in the supplemental file &#x2018;bibliography_egg_database&#x2019;.</p>

<title>Def ining egg traits</title>
<p>The egg traits in the database are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. For each trait listed below we used the descriptions of egg length and width as presented in the original publications. Given that conventions vary across entomologists and insect taxonomic groups, we present the following definitions to resolve ambiguous cases and to serve as a suggestion for future egg descriptions.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Egg</title><p>The term <italic>egg</italic> is used in the literature to describe several successive developmental stages, including the mature oocyte, the zygote cell, and the developing embryo in its eggshell. For consistency we selected measurements that were recorded closest to the time of fertilization, when multiple descriptions were available within a single publication, given that in some insects it has been documented that the dimensions of the egg change over time (typically &#x003C;20% change in length due to water exchange during embryonic development)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In most insects the egg is oviposited outside the adult body; however in viviparous insects, eggs proceed through some or all of embryonic development within the body of the mother. The egg is often enveloped in a secreted eggshell called the chorion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, which may have elaborations (e.g. dorsal appendages or opercula)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We selected egg measurements that excluded chorionic elaborations over those that included them, as our goal was to measure the comparable cellular material across species.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Length</title><p>To resolve ambiguous cases, and when measuring egg features from published images, we defined egg length as the dimension in millimeters (mm) of the axis perpendicular to the axis of rotational symmetry. This definition maximizes consistency with published descriptions of egg length. Under this definition, length is not always longer than width (as defined below). For some insect groups (e.g. Lepidoptera) the axis perpendicular to the axis of rotational symmetry is sometimes referred to in the literature as <italic>height</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For published images with a scale bar, we measured both the straight and curved length of the egg (for those eggs that are curved), but for all analyses and f igures, we used the straight length of the egg to maximize consistency with published records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>Width and breadth</title><p>To resolve ambiguous cases, and when measuring egg features from images, we defined width as the widest diameter (mm) of the rotationally symmetric axis of the egg. For some insect groups this axis is referred to in the literature as <italic>diameter</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> or <italic>breadth</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. For eggs described in published records as having a length, width, and breadth or depth (i.e., the egg is a flattened ellipsoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>), we considered <italic>width</italic> as the wider of the two diameters, and <italic>breadth</italic> as the diameter perpendicular to both width and length. For published images with a scale bar, we measured width as the widest of the three egg diameters at the first quartile, midpoint, and third quartile of the length axis. We did not measure breadth from published images.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b4">
<title>Volume</title><p>Volume (mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) was calculated using the equation for the volume of an ellipsoid, following previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The formula is <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, with <italic>l, w</italic>, and <italic>b</italic> as length, width, and breadth, respectively. This simplifies to <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> when the egg is rotationally symmetric. For records in which the volume was reported but egg length and width were not, we used the reported volume. For all other entries, we recalculated volume from the measurements in the text and from measurements of images published with a scale bar.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b5">
<title>Aspect ratio</title><p>We calculated aspect ratio as the ratio of length to width. An aspect ratio of one corresponds to a spherical egg. An aspect ratio less than one corresponds to an egg that is wider than long (oblate ellipsoid). An aspect ratio greater than one corresponds to an egg that is longer than it is wide (prolate ellipsoid). Analyses testing the sensitivity of our measurement software (see &#x201C;Assessing the accuracy of image measuring software&#x201D; below) for egg images indicated that the variance in measured aspect ratio increases sharply when aspect ratio is much higher than typical (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Therefore we excluded the eggs in the top 0.1 percentile of aspect ratio from the final database. We recorded the aspect ratio from images published with or without a scale bar, as aspect ratio is a scale-free attribute.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="s2b6">
<title>Asymmetry</title><p>We defined asymmetry as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic>q</italic>1 and <italic>q</italic>3 are the egg diameters at the first and third quartile of the curved length axis. Therefore an egg with an asymmetry of zero has quartile diameters with equal length. Baker&#x2019;s <italic>&#x03BB;</italic> value, used to measure asymmetry in bird eggs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, can be converted to the asymmetry parameter used in the present study. Analyses testing the sensitivity of our image measuring software (see &#x201C;Assessing the accuracy of image measuring software&#x201D; below) indicated that the variance increases sharply near the extreme high values of asymmetry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). We therefore excluded the eggs in the top 0.1 percentile of asymmetry from the final database. Asymmetry was only recorded from published egg images.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b7">
<title>Angle of curvature</title><p>We defined the angle of egg curvature as the angle of the arc (measured in degrees) created by the endpoints and midpoint of the length axis. Analyses testing the sensitivity of our image measuring software (see &#x201C;Assessing the accuracy of image measuring software&#x201D; below) indicated that the variance in curvature increases when the curvature and aspect ratio are low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). We therefore did not calculate curvature for eggs with an aspect ratio of one or less. Angle of curvature was only recorded from published egg images.</p>

<label>3.3</label>
<title>Extracting egg descriptions from text sources</title>
<p>Information was extracted from publications using a custom text parsing tool that automatically opened and searched the text of a PDF of the publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/shchurch/Insect_Egg_Evolution">https://github.com/shchurch/Insect_Egg_Evolution</ext-link>, file &#x2018;parsing_eggs.py&#x2019;, commit bd765c8). The tool, written in Python2, uses a text scoring formula to identify candidate blocks of text that contain egg descriptions and corresponding names. Each database entry was manually verified and stored in tab delimited format.</p>
<p>All entries included, at a minimum, a genus name and an egg measurement in one dimension or egg volume. Measurements were recorded as either an average and deviation, a range of measurements, or a single value, with precedence for inclusion given in that order. A text description of the volume of the egg was included only in cases in which there were no available data on the linear dimensions of the egg. The majority of the descriptions are reported as single values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Measuring published images of eggs</title>
<p>Published images of eggs were measured using a custom tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sdonoughe/Insect_Egg_Image_Parser">https://github.com/sdonoughe/Insect_Egg_Image_Parser</ext-link>, commit faee2e8) that enabled the user to calculate aspect ratio, curvature, and asymmetry of the egg by dropping guided landmarks on the published egg image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). If the published image included a scale bar, the program also measured the absolute length and width of the egg. The final output of this tool was combined with the corresponding text description of the egg of that species. Images were included regardless of type (e.g. light micrograph, scanning electron micrograph, drawing). However, images of low quality were excluded by manually evaluating cases where landmarks could not be placed unambiguously.</p>

The tool draws two lines connecting these points (<italic>q</italic>1 and <italic>q</italic>3). The user places points S1 and S2 at the ends of the scale bar. <bold>F</bold> Collected measurements from this image are as follows: Length is the distance from L1 to L2.

Width is the longest distance between <italic>q</italic>1, <italic>q</italic>2, and <italic>q</italic>3. Aspect ratio is the ratio of length to width.

Egg length, width, breadth, volume, aspect ratio were log10 transformed, and egg curvature and asymmetry were square root transformed. For entries that had both a text description of egg size as well as an image with a scale bar, the text description was used in the final calculations. Both the raw and processed final database are freely available for download (Dryad <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/review?doi&#x003D;doi:10.5061/dryad.pv40d2r">https://datadryad.org/review?doi&#x003D;doi:10.5061/dryad.pv40d2r</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Cross-referencing entries with taxonomic and genetic databases</title>
<p>Taxonomic names parsed from the literature occasionally contained errors, including published typographical errors and optical character recognition errors. These errors needed to be corrected and the taxonomic names also had to be reconciled with currently accepted taxonomy in order to link egg morphology data with other data sources (e.g. published phylogenies). To address these issues, we developed a tool called TaxReformer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/brunoasm/TaxReformer">https://github.com/brunoasm/TaxReformer</ext-link>, commit 1831a11) that searches the Global Names Architecture (GN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> databases, taking advantage of the strengths of each database. For the taxa included in the insect egg database, GN had the most effective fuzzy matching algorithm and broadest database. OTT provided a better control of the context of each taxonomic query, enabling one to search names only among insects and avoiding homonyms in kingdoms regulated by different codes of nomenclature. OTT&#x2019;s fuzzy matching algorithm, however, often returned matches to the correct species name but wrong genus name with a high confidence score. OTT and GBIF both contain information about higher taxonomy, which is not standardized in records obtained from GN.</p>
<p>Names obtained from the literature were first parsed with Global Names Parser v. 0.3.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> to obtain genus and species name in canonical forms. The full species name was then used to search in GN with fuzzy matching to allow for correction of optical character recognition errors. If a match to a species or genus was found, the matched name was recorded and then searched in OTT to obtain higher taxonomy and identifier numbers from OTT and the National Center for Biotechnology Information. If the name was not found in OTT, higher taxonomy was alternatively obtained from GBIF. In all cases, if databases contained information about synonyms, the currently accepted name for each taxon was retrieved.</p>

<title>Assessing intraspecif ic variation</title>
<p>We assessed intraspecific variation in egg size descriptions using four methods:
First, for database entries that reported egg size variation (e.g. egg descriptions that included a range of egg length or an average egg length with deviation), the percent difference in egg size was calculated as follows: for egg descriptions recorded as ranges, percent difference was calculated as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; for egg descriptions recorded as average and deviations, percent difference was calculated as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Second, independent observations of a single species were identified as two entries for the same species that differed in the calculated volume by more than 1.0 &#x002A; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>. This excluded entries that were repeated publications of the same description, such as an observation repeated in a subsequent review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The percent difference in egg length was calculated as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Third, for entries that had both a text description of egg length as well as a published image with a scale bar, the difference in the reported egg length and our re-measurement of the image was assessed. The percent difference between these two measurements was calculated as <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Fourth, for eggs that were measured as triaxial ellipsoids (length, width, and breadth measured all separately), the percent difference was calculated from the change in egg volume if the egg had been assumed to be a rotationally symmetric ellipsoid <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="471953v1_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Given that more eggs are likely triaxial ellipsoids than are reported in the egg database, this metric gives insight into the variation in egg volume that might be masked when only two dimensions are reported.</p>

<title>Assessing the precision of entries</title>
<p>The distribution of precision in the insect egg database was assessed using two metrics. First, the number of decimal places used in the length measurement was calculated for each database entry from a base of millimeters (e.g. &#x2018;1 mm&#x2019; has 0 decimal places, while &#x2018;1.00 mm&#x2019; has 2 decimal places). Second, the relative precision of each measurement was calculated by dividing the total length of the egg by the smallest unit used to measure it, and multiplying this value by 100. This gives the percent of egg length captured by the unit of measurement (i.e. an egg measured as 1.00 mm was measured within 1% of egg length).</p>

<title>Technical validation</title>
<p>The accuracy of the image measuring software was assessed using an array of 24 simulated egg silhouettes with known combinations of parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We found that as the actual angle of curvature increases, the difference between the actual and measured values increases (that is, the software underestimates the angle of curvature), and this difference is larger in eggs with lower aspect ratio and higher asymmetry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). As the actual asymmetry increases the variance in measured asymmetry increases, and in eggs with low aspect ratio this results in an overestimation of asymmetry. As the actual aspectratio increases, the software overestimates the total aspect ratio by up to 0.75 (12.5% of the total aspect ratio). Given these results we removed eggs in the top 0.1 percentile of values for asymmetry and aspect ratio when creating the final database.</p>
<p>Intraspecif ic variation in insect egg size was assessed using four metrics (see Methods section &#x201C;Assessing intraspecific variation&#x201D;). The first two describe the percent difference in egg size reported in the literature, either as variation recorded in an egg description (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), or as variation recorded across multiple independent observations of eggs from the same species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In both cases the percent difference in egg length averaged 10% and ranged from 1% to 100% (i.e., for an insect species with an average egg length of 1 mm, it was common to observe eggs from 0.9 to 1.1 mm and occasional outliers at 0.5 and 2 mm.</p>
<p>Additionally we re-measured published images of eggs and calculated the percent difference between our measurements and the text description (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The variation between observations of the same species was consistent with the reported intraspecific variation (average around 10%).</p>
<p>Although the majority of eggs in the database are described as rotationally symmetric ellipsoids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), for a few clades of insects it is common to measure eggs as triaxial ellipsoids, with length, width, and breadth measured separately (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Calculating the egg volume using two different methods &#x2014; one taking into account breadth, and the other assuming rotational symmetry &#x2014; showed that the percent difference in calculated volume ranges between 10% and 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Eggs from additional clades might be more accurately modeled as triaxial ellipsoids than currently reported in the literature, but this percent difference likely represents the upper range of the error in volume, because the clades typically measured as triaxial ellipsoids are those that are most obviously flattened along one axis.</p>
<p>The text descriptions in the insect egg database were extracted from a diverse set of sources published over hundreds of years, and the precision used to measure eggs varies across these sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Most entomologists measured eggs in tenths or hundredths of a millimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In terms of the total length of the egg, most measurements in the database are precise to within 1% to 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Given that intraspecific variation is also around 10% of total egg length, it is likely that some of this variation is due to measurement error.</p>
<p>The egg database contains descriptions of eggs from every insect order and from hundreds of insect families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Given that the number of species varies greatly across taxonomic ranks we assessed the phylogenetic coverage of the egg database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). We found that families and orders with the highest number of estimated species are represented by the greatest number of entries in the egg database. Additionally, most families in the egg database have more than 1 entry per 100 species.</p>
<p>There are several orders represented in the database by fewer than ten entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We suggest that this is likely due in part to idiosyncracies of the entomological research for certain clades. For example, although many descriptions of mantis and cockroach oothecae exist, measurements or images of individual eggs within the oothecae are rare in the published literature, which leaves these groups undersampled for propagule size in the literature. The orders with the lowest representation&#x2014;Trichoptera, Psocoptera, and Zygentoma&#x2014;are potentially rich new datasets to target for future study.</p>
