<abstract>
<p>About 16&#x0025; of breast cancers fall into a clinically aggressive category designated triple negative (TNBC) due to a lack of ERBB2, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The mutational spectrum of TNBC has been characterized as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><sup>4</sup></xref>; however, snapshots of primary tumors cannot reveal the mechanisms by which TNBCs progress and spread. To address this limitation we initiated the Intensive Trial of OMics in Cancer (ITOMIC)-001, in which patients with metastatic TNBC undergo multiple biopsies over space and time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of 67 samples from 11 patients identified 426 genes containing multiple distinct single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the same sample, instances we term Multiple SNVs affecting the Same Gene and Sample (MSSGS). We find that &#x003E;90&#x0025; of MSSGS result from cis-compound mutations (in which both SNVs affect the same allele), that MSSGS comprised of SNVs affecting adjacent nucleotides arise from single mutational events, and that most other MSSGS result from the sequential acquisition of SNVs. Some MSSGS drive cancer progression, as exemplified by a TNBC driven by FGFR2(S252W;Y375C). MSSGS are more prevalent in TNBC than other breast cancer subtypes and occur at higher-than-expected frequencies across TNBC samples within TCGA. MSSGS may denote genes that play as yet unrecognized roles in cancer progression.</p>

<p>The Intensive Trial of OMics in Cancer (ITOMIC)-001 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01957514) enrolls patients with metastatic TNBC who have not received platinum based therapies and are scheduled to receive cisplatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Up to seven different metastatic sites are biopsied prior to cisplatin, following discontinuation of cisplatin, and following subsequent therapies. Additional samples are accessed as archival tissues, as leftovers following clinically indicated procedures, and from tissues taken at autopsy. Samples are selected for sequencing based on specimen size and tumor content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Results from 11 of the first 12 subjects are presented here because low tumor purities in Subject 08 precluded analysis. We performed WES of germline DNA and 67 tumor samples (<bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>), including transiently cultured cells derived from a malignant pleural effusion in Subject 01 and two highly enriched samples of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) obtained following leukapheresis in Subject 02<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5"><sup>5</sup></xref>. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was also performed in 39 samples. The number of assessed samples per patient ranged from 2 to 16 (median 7), and the number of assessed time points ranged from 1 to 6 (median 3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Our analysis focused on somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which comprise the majority of mutations in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><sup>4</sup></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6"><sup>6</sup></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><sup>7</sup></xref>. WES identified a total of 8449 SNVs, of which 7067 occurred within 5136 protein coding genes, including 43 breast cancer driver genes (0.84&#x0025;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7"><sup>7</sup></xref> (data not shown). Across all 67 samples, 1403 genes were affected by &#x003E;1 SNV. Remarkably, 426 genes were found to contain &#x003E;1 SNV within the same tumor sample (<bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>), and we designated these instances Multiple SNVs affecting the Same Gene and Sample (MSSGS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>).</p>
<p>MSSGS were observed in 65 of 67 samples, with a median of 8 and a range of 0 to 133 MSSGS per sample (<bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>). The distribution of median transcript sizes was no larger for MSSGS than for genes affected by single SNVs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><sup>8</sup></xref> (Extended Data Fig. 1). Concomitant WGS in 39 of 65 samples independently confirmed 48 of 150 evaluable MSSGS (32&#x0025;), with most of the unconfirmed cases being attributable to the relatively lower read counts associated with WGS (<bold>Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Methods</bold>), although a fraction of MSSGS (11&#x0025; - 15&#x0025;) may represent artifacts associated with WES (<bold>Supplementary Methods</bold>). While somatic variants are unevenly distributed across cancer genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8"><sup>8</sup></xref>, we found similar mutation densities in regions surrounding MSSGS compared to isolated SNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>) with the exception of an MSSGS involving <italic>MUC4</italic>, which fell within a region of kataegis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9"><sup>9</sup></xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

<p>MSSGS can arise when two or more SNVs affect: i) the same gene in different tumor cells, ii) different alleles in the same cell, or iii) the same allele in the same cell (cis-compound mutation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To assess the frequency with which SNVs contributing to MSSGS co-localize to form a cis-compound mutation we cloned and sequenced tumor DNA from eight patients, revealing a very high frequency of cis-compound mutations (12 of 13 evaluable MSSGS - 92&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Haplotype phasing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10"><sup>10</sup></xref> of 407 MSSGS similarly indicated that &#x003E;90&#x0025; were attributable to cis-compound mutations (<bold>Extended Data Table 3</bold>). This tendency for SNVs contributing to MSSGS to affect the same allele may result from a DNA strand bias in susceptibility to point mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11"><sup>11</sup></xref>, or from a selection of genes bearing cis-compound mutations.</p>

<p>Assessing SNVs across different tumor samples from the same patient provides insight into the spatial and temporal origins of MSSGS. 130 of 426 MSSGS (&#x007E;30.5&#x0025;) were detected in at least two tumor samples from the same patient. Among these repeatedly detected MSSGS, three contiguous SNVs affecting ZZZ3 were all detected in the same 4 of 7 samples from Subject 02 at nearly identical frequencies, suggesting their presence in the same cells (<bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>), and a similar pattern was observed for <italic>ADAM33</italic>, which was detected in the same 3 of 16 samples from Subject 01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>). These patterns align with results from cloning and sequencing these MSSGS fragments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), which showed that either all SNVs contributing to the cis-compound mutation were observed or none were observed, consistent with their emergence from single mutational events.</p>

<p>Other MSSGS result from the sequential acquisition of SNVs, as seen for <italic>FGFR2</italic>(S252W;Y375C), in which S252W appeared after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and both S252W and Y375C were found in a metastatic lymph node 2 years later, persisting in all nine subsequent samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>). In yet other cases contributing SNVs made separate and sporadic appearances prior to detection of the complete MSSGS, as exemplified by an MSSGS involving <italic>F8</italic> in Subject 01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>).</p>

<p>Assessing allelic frequencies for all 426 MSSGS across 65 tumor samples revealed two distinct patterns. For the 71 MSSGS containing SNVs that affect consecutive nucleotides (including the above-referenced <italic>ADAM33</italic> and <italic>ZZZ3</italic>) we observed near perfect concordance in allelic frequencies between participating SNVs across tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>), consistent with their emergence from single mutational events (r=0.98). In contrast, concordance in allelic frequencies between SNVs separated by 1 or more nucleotides was significantly lower (r=0.27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>). These findings indicate that the large majority of MSSGS containing immediately adjacent SNVs arose as single mutational events, whereas most other MSSGS were built from SNVs that arose separately.</p>
<p>Prior knowledge supports the functional significance of some MSSGS. For example, both missense mutations involving FGFR2(S252W;Y375C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>) modify ligand binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12"><sup>12</sup></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13"><sup>13</sup></xref>. FGFR2 S252W and Y375C have been separately associated with the congenital disorders Alpert Syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14"><sup>14</sup></xref> and Beare-Stevenson Syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15"><sup>15</sup></xref>, respectively, and while each mutation has also been separately associated with endometrial cancer and FGFR2(S252W;Y375C) has been observed in a single case of endometrial cancer, neither mutation has been reported previously in breast cancer. To further evaluate <italic>FGFR2</italic>(S252W;Y375C) we extracted RNA from transiently cultured breast cancer cells from Subject 01, performed reverse transcriptase - PCR, and sequenced the cloned PCR fragments. Among 13 clones examined, 6 contained both mutations, 5 contained S252W only, and 2 were wildtype (data not shown). These results are consistent with the temporal acquisition of these SNVs, in which the S252W mutation arose first and Y375C was acquired later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <bold>Extended Data Table 1</bold>). A drug susceptibility screen using the same transiently cultured breast cancer cells demonstrated a much greater susceptibility to the FGFR2 inhibitor, ponatinib, compared to 19 TNBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref>), and ponatinib treatment in the patient produced a regression of breast cancer infiltrates in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Possibly indicative of a growth advantage conferred by other MSSGS are results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, which show that for MSSGS involving <italic>ABHD16Ac</italic>, <italic>TMPRSS13</italic> and <italic>ROBO4</italic>, sequences bearing the entire cis-compound mutation are more abundant than sequences containing only one of the component SNVs.</p>
<p>We reasoned that if cis-compound mutations can confer a selective advantage in TNBC, MSSGS might be more prevalent than would be predicted from a random co-localization of SNVs. To address this question we evaluated 106 TNBC samples from the TCGA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5s</xref> shows the number of SNVs contributing to MSSGS against the total SNV count for each of 106 TNBC samples from TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4"><sup>4</sup></xref>. We also plotted a theoretical curve under the null hypothesis that MSSGS arise from the random co-localization of SNVs (see <bold>Supplementary Methods</bold>). The assumptions inherent in generating this theoretical curve exert a greater impact at high SNV counts; therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref> we exclude the 5 samples containing &#x003E;600 SNVs, and focus on the remaining 101 samples carrying fewer than 200 SNVs. As expected, the number of SNVs contributing to MSSGS increases in accordance with the total number of SNVs. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref> also shows that the number of observed SNVs contributing to MSSGS tends to exceed levels predicted by the theoretical curve. These results indicate that for many samples, the number of SNVs contributing to MSSGS is higher than predicted had they arisen independently. To further examine this phenomenon, we performed a permutation test for each of the 106 patients to test the null hypothesis that SNVs co-localize to form MSSGS randomly (details are provided in Methods). With the 106 resulting p-values, we accept six patients when we use the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16"><sup>16</sup></xref> to control the false discovery rate at 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we assessed the frequency of MSSGS in 993 breast cancer samples from TCGA. While there were no significant differences in the mean or median numbers of MSSGS per sample (data not shown), nor in the fraction of MSSGS per SNV, a higher percentage of TNBCs contained at least 1 MSSGS (74.5&#x0025;) compared to HER2&#x002B; breast cancers (61.5&#x0025;), or ER&#x002B; breast cancers (49.7&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c-f</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence presented here supports the involvement of MSSGS in tumor growth based on our findings that: i) The large majority of MSSGS are attributable to cis-compound mutations; ii) FGFR2(S252W;Y375C) has unambiguous functional significance; iii) sequences bearing the entire cis-compound mutation are frequently more abundant than sequences bearing only one of the component SNVs; and iv) MSSGS are detected at significantly higher frequencies than would be predicted from the random co-localization of SNVs in subsets of patients with TNBC. MSSGS lack many features of conventional driver mutations because they are not widely detected across tumors from different individuals, are typically present at sub-clonal levels, and are frequently not associated with cancer initiation but rather cancer progression. Some of the MSSGS described here are unlikely drivers of cancer progression, exemplified by <italic>MUC4</italic>, which resides in a region of increased mutation density (Extended Data Fig. 2).</p>

Driver mutations arising at metastatic sites of disease face a different set of constraints compared to driver mutations resident in primary tumors. Since cancers typically require years to become clinically evident, driver mutations conferring even a slight selective advantage can gain predominance due to the compounding effect of time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33"><sup>33</sup></xref>. In contrast, driver mutations acquired at metastatic sites of disease have a much shorter timeframe over which to gain a foothold, and the cells against which they compete have demonstrated a high degree of fitness. Therefore, driver mutations acquired at metastatic sites would be expected to be frequently present at subclonal levels. In conclusion, MSSGS appear to provide examples of &#x201C;intramolecular epistasis&#x201D; in the promotion of cancer progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34"><sup>34</sup></xref>.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s1a"><title>Clinical Trial</title>
<p>ITOMIC-001 was approved by the Solid Tumor Scientific Review Committee and the Institutional Review Board of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01957514). Patients enroll from two sites: the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Northwest Medical Specialties (NWMS), a private practice with offices in Tacoma and Puyallup, Washington. Eligible subjects have metastatic TNBC, are platinum naive, and are scheduled to receive Cisplatin. Informed consent (Appendix 2) is conducted through detailed in person discussions involving, minimally, the principal investigator, the subject, and a subject family member, and last 1 - 2 hours. Study oversight is provided by a Data Safety Monitoring Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b"><title>Biopsies</title>
<p>Biopsies of metastases involving lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, and liver were performed under ultrasound guidance using an 18 gauge BioPince Full-Core Biopsy instrument. Up to 5 disease sites were biopsied in a single setting, and multiple biopsies were performed per disease site. Bone marrow biopsies were taken from the iliac crest using a Jamshidi T-Handle needle. Skin biopsies were performed using 3 - 4 mm punch biopsy instrument. In Subject 2 circulating tumor cells were collected by leukapheresis. All biopsies were performed using local anesthesia and most were performed using conscious sedation. Biopsy specimens were processed in accordance with a standardized set of operating procedures and subjects were contacted one day and one week following the procedure to assess for complications.</p>
<sec id="s1b1"><title>Rapid On-Site Evaluation</title>
<p>Core biopsy samples of metastases involving lymph nodes, soft tissues, or liver were immediately photographed and divided orthogonally. One half was formalin fixed (for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding [FFPE]) and the other half was gently pressed against an RNAse treated slide to generate a touch prep, then immediately snap frozen. Cytological evaluation of the touch prep was performed by a pathologist in real time and, if necessary, additional biopsies were procured to optimize sample size and tumor content. The time interval between sample acquisition and the completion of processing (known as the cold ischemia time) was recorded and was, except for the bone marrow biopsies and leukaphereses, less than 5 minutes in all cases (Table 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b2"><title>Selection of Biopsy Specimens for Further Testing</title>
<p>FFPE specimens were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x0026;E), and evaluated by a pathologist for tumor cell content and necrosis. FFPE samples judged to have sufficient tumor content from different metastatic sites were stained for HER2 and ER. To select samples for sequencing we examined H&#x0026;E sections of the FFPE portion and touch preps of the corresponding snap frozen portion of each biopsy core, with the goal of maximizing tumor cell content. An uneven distribution of tumor cells across biopsy cores sometimes caused discordance in estimates of tumor cell content between the FFPE portion of a sample (assessed by morphology) and the corresponding snap frozen portion (estimated from the touch prep and variant allele frequencies from UW-OncoPlex).</p>

<sec id="s1b3"><title>Residual Clinical Materials</title>
<p>When feasible, leftover blood samples and pleural fluid specimens were processed and stored for analysis. The estimated time between sample collection and processing was recorded.</p>

<p>At the time of this submission, Subjects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 had died and Subject 3 was lost to followup. Samples from Subjects 1, 2, 6, 11 and 12 were collected at the time of autopsy and processed as FFPE tissues."</p>

<sec id="s1c"><title>Whole Exome Sequencing</title>
<p>WES is performed by the UW Northwest Clinical Genomics Laboratory, a CLIA--certified facility at the UW. DNA fragment libraries were constructed from tumor biopsies and blood (normal) using the Hyper Prep Library Preparation Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Each library was enriched for protein and RNA coding portions of the human genome using the SeqCap EZ Exome v3.0 (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI) capture system. The target includes all coding content from the CCDS, RefSeq and miRBase databases. Paired-end sequencing (100 bp) of enriched libraries was performed using TruSeq Rapid Sequencing-by-Synthesis chemistry on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) sequencer according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommended protocol. Base calls were generated in real-time on the HiSeq instrument (RTA 1.17.21.3 software). After sequencing was complete, resulting reads were demultiplexed and sample-specific FASTQs produced. The average depth of coverage was 188 and the range was 166 to 208. The resulting reads are aligned to the genome human reference (hg19) using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner), duplicate reads removed with Picard and variants called with GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit). BAM files are uploaded to DNAnexus (Mountainview, California) for subsequent somatic variant detection by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, UW and Data4Cure (using a proprietary algorithm).</p>

<sec id="s1d"><title>Whole Genome Sequencing</title>
<p>Confirmation of a subset of MSSGs was done by NantOmics (Culver City, CA), which performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 39 of the 67 samples described here, using the same DNA that had been tested by WES. WGS Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq X sequencing platform using libraries prepared via the KAPA Hyper prep kit. Tumor genomes were sequenced to an average depth of 60x, and Normal genomes were sequenced to an average depth of 30x.

<sec id="s1g"><title>Clonal Analysis of MSSGS</title>
<p>MSSGS-containing DNA fragments were PCR-amplified using primers flanking all participating SNVs. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pBluescript II KS&#x002B; vector and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>. For each MSSGS, DNA from about 100 colonies was individually prepared and sequenced, and the number of clones containing germline sequence or one or multiple participating SNVs was determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1h"><title>Comparing sizes of genes affected by MSSGS versus isolated SNVs</title>
<p>To assess whether the formation of MSSGS is related to gene size, we compared the distributions of the median transcript sizes between genes affected by MSSGs versus genes affected by isolated SNVs. We performed the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of the two distributions and found no significant difference (Extended Data Fig. 1). Gene transcript sizes were obtained from Biomart (Ensembl).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1i"><title>Haplotype phasing of SNVs associated with MSSGS</title>
<p>To assess the orientation of neighbouring SNVs within MSSGs, we used ReadBackedPhasing from Genome Analysis Toolkit version 3.3.0. Phasing information with at least 20.0 quality score was used to assess whether a pair of SNVs are cis or trans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1j"><title>Evaluating the local mutation rates in regions surrounding MSSGS vs isolated SNVs</title>
<p>To assess whether the formation of MSSGS is driven by elevated local mutation rates, we compared local mutation rates surrounding MSSGS with mutation rates genome wide. In order to calculate the local mutation rate for each MSSGS, we counted the number of SNVs identified by WGS in a 1 megabase window centered on each MSSGS (obtained by subtracting transcriptional stop site by the transcriptional start site, using RefSeq transcripts as a reference). We then calculated the local mutational rate across the genome by windowing each sample into 1MB windows and counting the number of SNVs. A plot of the local mutation rates surrounding MSSGS is depicted by the red circles shown in Figure 2a. Additionally, the distance between each neighboring SNV identified in the WGS samples was calculated to identify regions of kataegis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9"><sup>9</sup></xref>, which we defined as at least 10 SNVs in a 100 kilobase window. Only one MSSGS, involving <italic>MUC4</italic>, landed in such a region (Figure 2b).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1k"><title>The theoretical distribution of SNVs contributing to MSSGS</title>
<p>Suppose that a patient carries m SNVs in the tumor cells. Let N (N=17,672) be the total number of genes subject to possible mutation in TNBC, and W be a vector of length N. We assume that each gene can be mutated with a probability proportional to W, and W = 0.8W<sub>1</sub> &#x002B; 0.2W2, where W<sub>1</sub> is the normalized gene mutation frequency in TNBC samples in TCGA and W<sub>2</sub> is the normalized gene mutation frequency in non-TNBC BC samples in TCGA. We include the term 0.2W<sub>2</sub> because there are only 106 TNBC samples (in which 7,933 genes are mutated), and we want to use W<sub>2</sub> to mimic the unseen genes (which can be potentially mutated in TNBC). In each round of permutation, we randomly assign each of the <italic>m</italic> SNVs to one of the 17,672 genes with a probability proportional to W, and then count SNVs in MSSGS. We repeat this procedure 10,000 times, and each time we obtain a count of the number of SNVs contributing to MSSGS. We then use the median of these 10,000 counts as the expected number of SNVs contributing to MSSGS. The entire simulation procedure is repeated for m from 1 up to 1500, where 1500 is the maximal number of SNVs observed in the TCGA cohort.</p>
<p>To assign a patient-specific P-value, we repeat the above simulation procedure using the observed value of m. We then compare the observed count of SNVs contributing to MSSGS with the 10,000 count values from the simulation. We define the P-value as (t &#x002B; 1)/10001, where t is the number of times that the observed count of SNVs contributing to MSSGS is less than or equal to the count from simulations.</p>

Resulting dose curves were fitted using idbs&#x2019; XLFit and to a 4 Parameter Logistic Dose Response Model. The TNBC lines tested were BT-20, BT549, HCC1143, HCC1187, HCC1395, HCC1599, HCC1806, HCC1937, HCC2157, HCC38, HCC70, Hs 578T, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, MFM-223 and SW-527.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>LEGENDS FOR EXTENDED DATA FIGURES AND TABLES</title>
<p><bold>Extended Data Figure 1.</bold> CDF plots depicting distributions of median transcript sizes for genes affected by MSSGs versus genes affected by isolated SNVs. Results indicate that there is no significant relationship between gene size and MSSG formation.</p>
<p><bold>Extended Data Table 1.</bold> Summary of genes bearing multiple SNVs across 67 tumor samples. Rows indicate gene names, nucleotides at reference and alternate alleles, consequence, position and amino acid substitutions of missense mutations, codon changes, predicted functional consequences using Sift and Polyphen, and chromosomal positions. Columns indicate sample description, number of days post diagnosis, study day, whether tissue was snap frozen or stored as formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) or both, cold ischemia time, and estimated tumor purity. 3 columns describe each sample (designated 01-0-B1, etc). Ref = number of reads for reference allele; Alt = number of reads for alternate allele; VAF = variant allele frequency. Blank cells denote a value of zero.</p>
<p><bold>Extended Data Table 2. Confirmation of MSSGS by WGS</bold>. To confirm MSSGS identified by WES, 39 samples evaluated by WES were also examined using WGS. Results for each sample and MSSGS-associated SNV are shown. WGS_Ref and WGS_Alt indicate read counts for MSSGS-associated SNVs identified independently by WGS. WGS_RAW_Depth and WGS_RAW_ALT indicate read depths for MSSGSassociated SNVs identified by WES but not independently identified by WGS. P values were calculated using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test.</p>
<p><bold>Extended Data Table 3.</bold> Haplotype phasing<sup>10</sup> reveals that 394 of 407 MSSGS accessible for analysis (97&#x0025;) co-localized to the same allele.</p>
