<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding movies and stories requires maintaining a high-level situation model that abstracts away from particular perceptual details to describe the location, characters, actions, and causal relationships of the currently unfolding event. These models not only use the specific information present in the current narrative, but also draw on prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime. In order to identify the brain regions implicated in schematic perception, we collected fMRI data from 31 human subjects presented with sixteen three-minute stories, drawn from two different scripts (eating at a restaurant or going through the airport), each of which was composed of a temporal sequence of four schematic events. Aside from this shared script structure, the stories varied widely in terms of their characters and storylines, and were presented in two highly dissimilar formats with differing low-level features (audiovisual clips or spoken narration). We found that brain regions including the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and superior frontal gyrus exhibited script-specific temporal sequences of activity patterns that generalized across stories, across subjects, and across modalities. Using a Hidden Markov Model, we also show that representations in these regions can be used to predict the script (restaurant vs. airport) of a held-out, unlabeled timeseries with high accuracy, and can be used to temporally align multiple stories with a shared script. These results extend work on the perception of controlled, artificial schemas in human and animal experiments to naturalistic perception of complex narrative stimuli.</p>
<sec>
<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>In almost all situations we encounter in our daily lives, we are able to draw on our schematic knowledge about what typically happens in the world to better perceive and mentally represent our ongoing experiences. In contrast to previous studies that investigated schematic cognition using simple, artificial associations, we measured brain activity from subjects watching movies and listening to stories depicting restaurant or airport experiences. Our results reveal a network of brain regions that is sensitive to the shared temporal structure of these naturalistic situations. These regions abstract away from the particular details of each story, activating a representation of the general type of situation being perceived.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Everyday perception involves processing and reacting to a rich, rapidly changing stream of sensory information. A large body of work in cognitive psychology has shown that &#x201C;common sense&#x201D; comprehension requires not just bottom-up feature recognition, but also activation of knowledge schemas about the expected structure of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartlett, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Piaget, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zacks, Speer, Swallow, Braver, &#x0026; Reynolds, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous recent studies, in both humans and animals, have explored how schemas are stored in the brain and how they influence ongoing processing. A critical region implicated in many of these studies is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This region shows encoding-related activity predictive of subsequent memory for schema-congruent stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>), increased activity when remembering schematic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brod, Lindenberger, Werkle-Bergner, &#x0026; Shing, 2015</xref>), and upregulation of intermediate early gene expression when assimilating new information into a schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Tse et al., 2011</xref>), and damage to the mPFC results in deficits for schema-related processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ghosh, Moscovitch, Melo Colella, &#x0026; Gilboa, 2014</xref>). The mPFC is thought to mediate schematic activation in a network of regions, including the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">van Kesteren, Fern&#x00E1;ndez, Norris, &#x0026; Hermans, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">van Kesteren, Ruiter, Fern&#x00E1;ndez, &#x0026; Henson, 2012</xref>) and cortical regions such as posterior cingulate and angular gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gilboa &#x0026; Marlatte, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the connection between this work and real-world perception has been lacking. The vast majority of these neuroscientific studies of schema have used simple, arbitrary relationships such as flavor-place associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tse et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2011</xref>) or associations between artificial stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brod, Lindenberger, &#x0026; Shing, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brod et al., 2015</xref>). In naturalistic situations, we make use of highly elaborated schemas that have been learned and consolidated throughout our lifetimes, which may or may not rely on the same neural mechanisms as novel schemas involving simple relational binding. Also, most of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">van Kesteren et al., 2010</xref>) only compare schematic versus non-schematic conditions, making it unclear whether these regions actually represent information about <italic>which</italic> schema is active, or are engaged when <italic>any</italic> schema is active (regardless of content).</p>
<p>In this study we examine a specific type of naturalistic temporal schema, called a &#x201C;script.&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Schank &#x0026; Abelson (1977)</xref> described a script as &#x201C;a predetermined, stereotyped sequence of actions that defines a well-known situation,&#x201D; and proposed that &#x201C;most of understanding is script-based.&#x201D; This central role of scripts was echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mandler (1984)</xref>, who proposed that scripts &#x201C;are intimately involved in most of our daily processing, and an understanding of their structure and how it is used would add materially to our understanding of how the mind works.&#x201D; These theoretical proposals were followed by empirical studies of the contents and consistency of scripts across people, which found that subjects largely agreed on how to segment activities into events as well as the typical &#x201C;characters, props, actions, and the order of the actions&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bower, Black, &#x0026; Turner, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Using complex movies and audio narratives, we presented subjects with stories conforming to two different scripts that are highly familiar to our subject population: eating at a restaurant, and going through the airport. The stories within each script all shared the same high-level sequence of events (e.g. entering the restaurant, being seated, ordering, and eating food) but were highly dissimilar in terms of their low-level features (spoken words vs audiovisual movies), genres (e.g. science fiction vs thriller), characters, emotional content, and relative lengths of each of the constituent events. Using multiple converging analyses, we found that default mode regions, especially posterior medial cortex (PMC), mPFC, and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), exhibited sequences of activity patterns that were specific to each of the two scripts. These schema-specific event representations generalized across stories, across subjects, and across modalities, and were robust enough to be detected in held-out stories even without manual labeling of the events. These results uncover an abstract neural representation of the underlying schematic structure of real-life events as they unfold over time.</p>

<title>Subject details</title>
<p>We collected data from 32 subjects (13 female, ages 18-32). Subjects were native English speakers, in good health and with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Princeton University, and all subjects gave their written informed consent. To detect outlier subjects, each subject&#x2019;s average posterior medial cortex timecourse (as defined below) was correlated with the mean timecourse of all other subjects, to ensure that the subject had attended to and understood the narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Stephens, Silbert, &#x0026; Hasson, 2010</xref>). Based on this metric, one subject was excluded due to low correlation with the rest of the group (r=0.13, versus r=0.25-0.53 for the other 31 subjects).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>The stimuli were designed to conform to two naturalistic schematic scripts that we expected to be familiar to all our subjects: eating at a restaurant, or catching a flight at an airport. Each scenario consisted of four events. For the restaurant stories, the events were: entering and being taken to a table, sitting with menus, ordering food and waiting for its arrival, and food arriving and being eaten. For the airport stories, the events were: entering the airport, going through the security checkpoint, walking to and waiting at the gate, and getting onboard the airplane and sitting in a seat.</p>
<p>Each story was approximately 3 minutes long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To identify schema representations that were modality-invariant, we presented 4 audio-visual movies and 4 spoken narratives for each of the two schemas. The stories all involved different characters and spanned multiple genres, sharing only the same high-level schematic script. The movies were sampled from films in which the restaurant schema was depicted (<italic>Brazil</italic>, <italic>Derek</italic>, <italic>Mr. Bean</italic>, <italic>Pulp Fiction</italic>) or the airport schema was depicted (<italic>Due Date</italic>, <italic>Good Luck Chuck</italic>, <italic>Knight and Day</italic>, <italic>Non-stop</italic>), and were edited for time and to conform as closely as possible to the four-stage schema script. The audio narratives were adapted from film scripts with a restaurant scene (<italic>The Big Bang Theory</italic>, <italic>The Santa Clause</italic>, <italic>Shame</italic>, <italic>My Cousin Vinny</italic>) or an airport scene (<italic>Friends</italic>, <italic>How I Met Your Mother</italic>, <italic>Seinfeld</italic>, <italic>Up in the Air</italic>), also edited for length and to match the schematic script. All narratives were read by the same professional actor.</p>
<p>All 16 stimuli are publicly available &#x003C;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/Event_Schema_Stimuli/5760306/2">https://figshare.com/articles/Event_Schema_Stimuli/5760306/2</ext-link>&#x003E;.</p>

<p>Subjects (N=31) were presented with 16 narrative stimuli, half audiovisual movies (clips from movies) and half audio narratives (based on movie scripts, all read by the same voice actor). The narratives varied widely, but conformed to one of two schemas: eating at a restaurant (entering the restaurant, being seated at a table, ordering food from a menu, and eating the food when it arrives) or going on a flight (entering the airport, going through security, waiting at the boarding gate, and taking a seat on the plane). The timing of these schematic events differed across stories, but all stories were approximately 3 minutes long.</p></caption>

<title>Scanning parameters and preprocessing</title>
<p>Data were collected on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head/neck coil. Functional images were obtained with an interleaved multiband EPI sequence (TE &#x003D; 39 ms, flip angle &#x003D; 50&#x00B0;, multislice factor &#x003D; 4, multi-slice shift &#x003D; 3, FOV &#x003D; 192 mm x 192 mm, partial Fourier &#x003D; 6/8, echo spacing &#x003D; 0.93 ms, 60 oblique axial slices) resulting in a voxel size of 2.0mm isotropic and a TR of 1.5s. Whole-brain high-resolution (1.0 mm isotropic) T1-weighted structural mages were acquired with an MPRAGE sequence, and field maps were collected for dewarping (40 oblique axial slices, 3.0 mm isotropic).</p>
<p>Cortical surface extraction was performed on the anatomical image, using FreeSurfer 5.3. The Freesurfer epidewarp.fsl script was used to compute a voxel shift map to account for B0 distortion. The FreeSurfer Functional Analysis Stream (FsFast) was used to preprocess the fMRI data (alignment to the anatomy, motion and B0 correction, resampling to fsaverage6 cortical surface and subcortical MNI volume, 4mm smoothing). The resampled data (timecourses on the left and right hemispheres, and in the subcortical volume) were then read by a custom python script, which implemented the following preprocessing steps: removal of nuisance regressors (the 6 degrees of freedom motion correction estimates, and low-order legendre drift polynomials up to order (1 &#x002B; duration/150) as in AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cox, 1996</xref>)), z-scoring each run to have zero mean and standard deviation of 1, and dividing the runs into the portions corresponding to each stimulus.</p>
<p>All subsequent analyses, described below, were carried out using custom python scripts and the Brain Imaging Analysis Kit &#x003C;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brainiak.org">http://brainiak.org</ext-link>&#x003E;.

<title>Region of interest and searchlight definition</title>
<p>Based on prior work on the representation of high-level, cross-modal situation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zadbood, Chen, Leong, Norman, &#x0026; Hasson, 2017</xref>), we focused our analysis primarily on regions within the default mode network. We derived these regions from an established network atlas on the fsaverage6 surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), by selecting the networks from their 17-network parcellation (networks 15, 16, and 17) that made up the full default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, &#x0026; Schacter, 2008</xref>) and then merging parcels that were spatially contiguous. This yielded six regions of interest (ROIs): angular gyrus (1868 vertices), superior temporal sulcus (STS, 2118 vertices), superior frontal gyrus (SFG, 2461 vertices), medial prefontal cortex (mPFC, 2069 vertices), parahippocampal cortex (PHC, 882 vertices), and posterior medial cortex (PMC, 2495 vertices). Additionally, we used the freesurfer subcortical parcellation to extract the hippocampus as a region of interest (Hipp, 1289 voxels).</p>
<p>As a control, we also defined an auditory cortex region based on correlations with the audio envelope of the stimuli. For every story (both movies and narratives), the root mean square amplitude of the audio signal was computed for every second of the stimulus. This was then convolved with a standard HRF (from AFNI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cox, 1996</xref>) and downsampled to the temporal resolution of the fMRI signal. All audio envelopes were concatenated and then correlated with the concatenated timeseries from all stories at each surface vertex. The highest correlations were in the vicinity of Heschl&#x2019;s gyrus, as expected, and an auditory cortex region was defined as all vertices with r &#x003E; 0.27 in order to yield an ROI of comparable size to the other regions (1589 vertices).</p>
<p>For each ROI or each searchlight, data were aligned across subjects using the Shared Response Model(SRM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">P.-H. Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The goal of SRM is to project all subjects&#x2019; data into a common, low-dimensional feature space, such that corresponding timepoints from the same story are close together in this space. Given time by voxel data matrices <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from every subject, SRM finds a voxel by feature transformation matrix <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for every subject such that <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x00B7; <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x2248; <italic>S</italic>, where <italic>S</italic> is the feature timecourses shared across all subjects. We use data from all stories to estimate these transformation matrices, projecting all timecourses into a 100-dimensional space. Note that this projection will inflate the inter-subject similarity for each story across subjects (since the transformations are chosen to maximize the similarity between corresponding timepoints), but will not artificially create similarity <italic>between</italic> stories, and does not use any information about the schema type of the stories. Performing our analyses without using SRM yielded similar but smaller effects (results not shown).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title>
<p>After listening to a short unrelated audio clip to verify that the volume level was set correctly, subjects were presented with four stories in each of four experimental runs. Each run consisted of interleaved video and audio stories, with one story from each modality and schema in each run, and a randomized run order across subjects. Every story was preceded by a five second black screen followed by a five-second countdown video, which were removed from all analyses. The title of each story was displayed at the top of the screen throughout the story (the screen was otherwise black for the audio narratives). Subjects were informed that they would be asked to freely recall the stories after all sixteen had been presented (recall data not analyzed in this paper).</p>
<p>Statistics for all analyses were computed using nonparametric permutation and bootstrap techniques, as described in the sections below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Event pattern correlation analysis</title>
<p>First, the 31 subjects were randomly divided into two groups (of 15 and 16 subjects). For each story, four regressors were created to model the response to the four schematic events, along with an additional nuisance regressor to model the initial countdown video. These were created by taking the blocks of time corresponding to these five segments and then convolving with the hemodynamic response function from AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cox, 1996</xref>). A separate linear regression was performed to fit the average response of each group (in the 100-dimensional SRM space) using the regressors, resulting in a 100-dimensional pattern of coefficients for each event of each story in each group. For every pair of stories, the pattern vectors for each of their corresponding events were correlated across groups (event 1 from group 1 with event 1 from group 2, event 2 from group 1 with event 2 from group 2, etc., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and the four resulting correlations were averaged. This yielded a 16 by 16 matrix of across-group story event similarity. To ensure robustness, the whole process was repeated for 10 random splits of the 31 subjects, and the resulting similarity matrices were averaged across splits. For comparison, the same analysis was also performed without breaking the story into four segments (i.e., simply treating each story as a single event).</p>
<p>We then computed the average story similarity for pairs of different stories from the same schema versus pairs of different stories from different schemas. To determine if this difference was statistically significant, we randomly permuted the schema labels of the stories to generate a null distribution, and converted the true difference into a z value relative to this null distribution (yielding a corresponding p value from the survival function of the normal distribution). Additionally, we computed a more restrictive version in which only pairs of stories from opposite modalities (movie and audio narration) were considered, to ensure that schematic similarity was not driven by modality-specific features. A corresponding null distribution was generated similarly, by shuffling the schema labels of the stories (but keeping the modality labels intact).</p>
<p>This analysis was applied within each of the ROIs and searchlights. To generate the final searchlight map, a z value was computed for each vertex as the average of the z values from all searchlights that included that vertex. The map of z values was then converted into map of q values using the same false discovery rate correction that is used in AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cox, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Schema classification analysis</title>
<p>An alternative analysis for detecting schematic structure was also performed, to determine if the schema type of novel stories could be decoded from fMRI data within an ROI, even when the novel stories have not been subdivided by hand into four events. Labels from 7 out of the 8 stories from each schema (the training set) were used to construct event regressors as for the event pattern correlation analysis above (including the initial countdown video), and these were then temporally concatenated to produce a single regressor for each event of each schema type. Linear regression was used to fit the group-average concatenated timecourse (for each dimension in the SRM) with these regressors, producing a characteristic pattern for each of the four events in each of the two schemas.</p>
<p>These event patterns were used to instantiate a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each schema. The HMM used here was introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baldassano et al. (2017)</xref>, and assumes that activity patterns in a region proceed through a sequence of discrete states, starting with the first event and ending in the last event. Within each event, activity patterns are assumed to be distributed in a Gaussian fashion around a mean event pattern. Here we set the mean event patterns to be the characteristic patterns derived from the training stories, and set the variance to be the empirical variance around these characteristic patterns within the corresponding events in the training stories.</p>
<p>Each of the two HMMs (for each schema) was fit to each of the two held-out stories (one from each schema). This resulted in a (probabilistic) segmentation of the story into four events that matched the four corresponding events of the HMM as closely as possible, under the constraint that the events had to be in the correct order. To evaluate the goodness of fit between the HMM and this story segmentation, we computed the four average patterns for the story timepoints assigned to each event, and compared them to the four characteristic HMM patterns by measuring the difference in mean correlation between corresponding and non-corresponding events. If the story is well-modeled by the HMM, this correlation should be high, since the fitting procedure will be able to find four events (in the correct order) whose average spatial pattern is very similar to the four characteristic patterns in the HMM. Therefore we attempted to classify which of the held-out stories came from which schema, based on which alignment of HMMs to stories provided a higher average match value.</p>
<p>The analysis described above was repeated for all possible choices of the two held-out stories. To obtain confidence intervals, we performed bootstrap sampling over subjects to produce 100 resampled datasets, and ran the full analysis on each bootstrap sample. Note that, to ensure subjects remained independent (as is required for bootstrap sampling), we performed the fitting of the SRM after resampling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Unsupervised alignment analysis</title>
<p>Finally, we sought to investigate whether the response to schematically-related narratives was consistent enough to automatically identify related events across stories, without relying on human annotations. For all stories within a single schema, the SRM timecourses were averaged across all subjects and the initial 8 timepoints from each story (corresponding to the initial countdown animation) were removed. The HMM was then fit simultaneously to all 8 stories, which entailed estimating a) a sequence of event-specific patterns that is common to all stories, and b) a (probabilistic) segmentation of each story into these shared events. The model therefore enforces that all stories must exhibit the same set of event patterns in the same order, but allows the durations of the events to vary across stories. This fitting procedure is described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baldassano et al. (2017)</xref>, and involves alternating between estimating the event patterns and the segmentations. After fitting, we convert the probabilistic segmentation into a hard segmentation, by assigning every timepoint to its most likely event. The number of latent events used (a hyperparameter of the HMM) was varied from 2 to 6 in steps of 1.</p>
<p>We then compared this model-predicted alignment to the hand-annotated event labels (defined as the maximum regressor of the event regressors described above). For any two stories, we found the set of pairs of timepoints (one from each story) that were predicted to be from the same event in the model, and compared it to the set of timepoint pairs that had the same hand-annotated event label. We computed the intersection over union (the number of pairs in both sets divided by the number of pairs in either set) as a measure of how well the model correspondence matched the annotation correspondence. This similarity measure was averaged over all pairs of stories within a schema, and results for both schemas were averaged. We generated a null distribution by replacing the model-defined event segmentation with a random segmentation, in which the event boundary timepoints were uniformly sampled from the set of all timepoints (without replacement), and performing the same analysis.</p>

<p>Our goal was to identify brain regions that represent the structure of real-life event schemas (e.g. eating at a restaurant) as they unfold over time (e.g. entering the restaurant, being seated, ordering, and eating food), irrespective of their low-level features, genres, characters, emotional content, and relative lengths of each of the constituent events. We therefore compared the activity patterns evoked by the schematic events of a story with those evoked by all other stories. We hypothesized that regions with schematic representations should show similarity between corresponding events of different stories with a shared schema but not stories with different schemas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
<p>Using both ROI analysis and a searchlight analysis, we found robust within-versus-between schema differences throughout the default mode network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), including the angular gyrus (p=0.009), STS (p=0.010), SFG (p &#x003C; 0.001), mPFC (p &#x003C; 0.001), PHC (p=0.005), and PMC (p=0.001). A borderline difference was also present in the hippocampus (p=0.066), and there was no significant difference in auditory cortex (p=0.137). The effect in auditory cortex was significantly smaller than that in angular gyrus (p=0.025), STS (p=0.043), mPFC (p=0.009), PHC (p=0.023), and PMC (p=0.002).</p>
<p>A more stringent requirement of schematic representation is that it should generalize across modalities. To test whether these effects were being driven solely by within-modality similarities (e.g. evoked by the visual objects or words associated with the schematic events), we repeated the same analysis but restricted our comparisons to pairs of story from different modalities (e.g. a spoken narration of a restaurant scene vs a movie clip of a restaurant scene). The pattern of significant effects was the same, including the angular gyrus (p=0.006), STS (p=0.030), SFG (p&#x003C;0.001), mPFC (p=0.005), PHC (p=0.003), and PMC (p=0.002), with nonsignificant effects in the hippocampus (p=0.073) and auditory cortex (p=0.100).</p>
<p>The searchlight analyses (performed both with all story pairs and with only across-modality story pairs) confirmed that the strongest effects occurred in these default mode ROIs, with weaker effects also evident in lateral prefrontal cortex and the insula.</p>
<p>In the analyses above we divided each schema into four events (e.g. entering the restaurant, being seated, ordering, and eating food), and then measured the mean similarity of the patterns evoked by each event. An alternative analysis was conducted in which a single average pattern was used for each story (rather than a pattern for each event). This showed effects that were in the same direction (stronger within- than across-schema correlations), but substantially weaker (all p&#x003E;0.12), suggesting that the representations in these regions are distinct for each of the stages of the schematic script.</p>

<caption><title>Event pattern correlations between stories.</title>
<p>(a) For each pair of stories, we compute the mean pattern correlation (in a region of interest) between the 4 corresponding events. We then binned these correlations depending on whether the two stories were drawn from the same schema or different schemas. (b) We found that, throughout the default mode network, stories from the same schema showed significantly higher event similarity compared to stories from different schemas. This result was not driven solely by modality-specific stimulus features, since it appears even when considering only pairs of stories from different modalities (audiovisual movie and audio narrative). Note that auditory regions were not strongly related to high-level schema, despite the presence of audio information in all stories.

<p>We then performed a more stringent analysis to determine if a story&#x2019;s schema could be predicted from brain activity <italic>without</italic> labeling its temporal structure. Successfully predicting the schema of a held-out, unlabeled timeseries requires not just that the correctly-segmented event patterns are similar to the correct schema (as in the prior analysis), but also that there is <italic>no</italic> segmentation of the timeseries that yields event patterns similar to the incorrect schema. Using event annotations from 7 out of the 8 stories from each schema, we constructed characteristic activity patterns for each of the events from each schema. Using a Hidden Markov Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>), we then attempted to segment the held-out stories into schematic events, with activity patterns matching the characteristic schema patterns from each schema. This allowed us to predict the schema type of the held-out, unlabeled story, based on which set of characteristic patterns best matched its evoked activity.</p>
<p>Even in this highly challenging classification task, we found significantly above-chance performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in SFG (72&#x0025; accuracy, p=0.002), mPFC (80&#x0025;, p&#x003C;0.001), and PMC (68&#x0025;, p=0.002). Borderline differences were observed in angular gyrus (59&#x0025; accuracy, p=0.08) and PHC (61&#x0025; accuracy, p=0.051). The other ROIs yielded lower, nonsignificant levels of performance (auditory cortex: 59&#x0025;, p=0.13; STS: 58&#x0025;, p=0.24; hippocampus: 58&#x0025;, p=0.19).</p>

<p>(a) Using the labeled event from 7 of the 8 stories (from each schema), we computed the average spatial activity pattern for each of the 4 events (from each schema), and used these as the latent event representations in two hidden markov models (HMMs). We then used the HMMs to find the best possible alignment of the held-out stories to each schema (without being given any event annotations), and predicted the schema of the held-out stories based on which of these alignments was better. (b) Superior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior medial cortex all and medial prefrontal cortex showed classification rates well above chance, indicating that these regions exhibit robust schema-related patterns that can be identified in novel stories even without explicit event labels. &#x002A;&#x002A; p&#x003C;0.01 by bootstrap test, shaded regions indicate bootstrap confidence distributions</p></caption>

<p>Finally, we employed data-driven methods to identify shared structure among stories within a schema, without the use of <italic>any</italic> prior knowledge of the schema&#x2019;s temporal event structure (unlike the prior analysis, which used labeled annotations during training). Unlabeled timecourses from all eight stories within a schema were fit by an HMM, which sought to segment all stories into a sequence of events, such that the average activity patterns within each event were similar across stories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We varied the number of latent events from 2 to 6, and measured how well the data-driven correspondence matched the hand-labeled schematic structure.</p>
<p>We found the SFG, mPFC, and PMC were all able to produce above-chance story alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), with the match peaking around 4 events (the number of schematic events the stimuli were constructed to have). Note that the correspondence was optimized simply to align the fMRI timeseries of different narratives, and was not guaranteed to share any similarity with the hand-labeled annotations. As shown in an example alignment derived from the SFG data with four events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), the HMM is able to find correspondences across stories despite large variability in their specific content. These results indicate that schematic scripts are not only detectable in these regions (using the supervised analyses presented above), but are in fact a dominant organizing principle of their dynamic representations which can be discovered from an unsupervised alignment across stories.</p>

<caption><title>Unsupervised alignment of events across stories.</title>
<p>(a) For each set of 8 stories within the same schema, we trained an HMM to identify a sequence of shared latent event patterns that was common across all the stories (without using any hand-labeled events). This correspondence can then be compared to the hand-labeled correspondence between stories. (b) We can recover the schematic structure shared across stories using only fMRI data, without event labeling, from all three ROIs showing strong schema representations in the previous analyses (SFG, mPFC, and PMC). This match is closest when the number of latent events in the model is similar to the true number of events (4). Dotted line indicates p&#x003C;0.01 by permutation test, Bonferroni corrected for 5 tests. (c) For example, the data-driven correspondence between timepoints of &#x201C;How I Met Your Mother&#x201D; and &#x201C;Up in the Air&#x201D; (from SFG, with 4 events) captures the shared schematic events (entering the airport, going through security, waiting at the boarding gate, and taking a seat on the plane) despite large differences in the details of the narratives.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results provide the first evidence that naturalistic perception activates dynamic information about the temporal structure of real-world scripts in mPFC, as well as a broader network including SFG and PMC. All three of these regions exhibited cross-subject, cross-modal shared representations of schematic events that could be used to classify the script type of held-out stories. Timecourses in these regions can be used to produce unsupervised alignments of stories with shared scripts, indicating that schematic representations are a primary driver of their ongoing representations. These effects were driven largely by patterns that were specific to the subcomponents of the schema as it unfolds over time, rather than patterns that were constant across the entire story, providing further evidence that the dynamic temporal nature of these script events is encoded in these regions. We also found weaker, less consistent evidence for schematic representations in the angular gyrus, hippocampus, STS, and PHC.</p>
<p>Prior work has shown that high-level regions including posterior medial cortex exhibit activity patterns that generalize across audio and video versions of the same story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zadbood et al., 2017</xref>); this work extends this generalization to a further level of abstraction, showing similarities between <italic>distinct stories</italic> with very different content but a shared schematic skeleton. Our HMM-based classification approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>) allows us to predict the schematic category of held-out stories with varying event timings purely from fMRI data, extending traditional decoding analyses into the temporal domain.</p>

<title>Brain regions associated with schematic representations</title>
<p>There has been very little prior work investigating the neural mechanisms of real-world script-based perception. Work on simpler types of schematic representations have consistently implicated mPFC, based on encoding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brod et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2010</xref>), recall activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brod et al., 2015</xref>), gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Tse et al., 2011</xref>), and lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Warren, Jones, Duff, &#x0026; Tranel, 2014</xref>). Our results connect this large body of work with naturalistic scripts, suggesting that the same underlying neural mechanisms may be at play in both cases. Although the precise location of these mPFC results varies across studies, our peak effects fall squarely within an ROI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) belonging to the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>), which has direct anatomical connections to posterior medial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greicius, Supekar, Menon, &#x0026; Dougherty, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Schematic representations in mPFC are thought to interact with a network of posterior cortical regions, including posterior cingulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">van Buuren et al., 2014</xref>) and angular gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gilboa &#x0026; Marlatte, 2017</xref>). Our results show strongly schematic responses in PMC and weaker effects in angular gyrus, providing evidence that these regions either are modulated by information from mPFC or contain schematic information themselves. These regions are known to be sensitive to the structure of real-life events over relatively long timescales (minutes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hasson, Chen, &#x0026; Honey, 2015</xref>), and are involved during a spoken replay of a narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">J. Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zadbood et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting that they encode and simulate sequences of actions in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, some studies have argued for schema formation within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>), while others have found that the hippocampus is most coupled to the cortex in the absence of a schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">van Kesteren et al., 2010</xref>). We found relatively weak effects in the hippocampus in all three of our analyses. It is possible that extensively-learned scripts (such as the ones we used) are consolidated entirely into the cortex and are no longer mediated by the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Norman &#x0026; O&#x2019;Reilly, 2003</xref>), or that hippocampal patterns would become schema-specific if subjects&#x2019; attention were explicitly directed to the schematic structure of the stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aly &#x0026; Turk-Browne, 2016</xref>). Another possibility is that extensively-learned script representations are supported by highly sparse activity (possibly only present in a subregion of the hippocampus) that is not easily detectable using fMRI.</p>

<title>Building specific events from general scripts</title>
<p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>), we found that brain activity in posterior default mode regions jumps rapidly to a new, stable pattern at the start of a new event. This result raises a question: how can activity settle so quickly into a representation of the new event, when there has been very little time to accumulate information about the content of the event? Our results suggest a possible explanation of this phenomenon. If schematic script information is rapidly activated at the beginning of an event, and this information plays a critical role in setting the representations in these regions, then a substantial portion of the event representations can appear quickly at the beginning of an event. This proposal is similar to theories of visual perception, in which object associations are rapidly activated in mPFC and then used to influence representations in perceptual regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bar, 2007</xref>). In future work, approaches such as semantic modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vodrahalli et al., 2017</xref>) may be able to disentangle the contribution of both schematic and specific content to the instantiation of event representations.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Open questions</title>
<p>Although proposed models of schematic perception and memory have focused on mPFC and the medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">van Kesteren et al., 2012</xref>), our results suggest that SFG and PMC also play critical roles in the activation of schematic knowledge. Both of these regions have long processing timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">J. Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and therefore our approach of using long stimuli with intact temporal structure may be necessary for studying the involvement of these regions. Further experiments will be required to identify the distinct functional contributions of these regions to perceptual and memory tasks, and to identify when and how they interact to produce schematic representations.</p>
<p>Another critical dimension is how representations in these regions develop over a lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brod, Werkle-Bergner, &#x0026; Shing, 2013</xref>), since mPFC and its connections mature slowly throughout the first decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sowell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Supekar et al., 2010</xref>) and real-world event scripts can only be acquired after many exposures to events with shared structure. Both developmental studies and computational models of script learning could be used to understand how scripts develop in complexity, and whether perceptual representations become more script-based over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brod et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, both this study and prior work on real-world scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bower et al., 1979</xref>) have examined only a small fraction of the full library of scripts that adults have acquired over their lives, and have focused primarily on narrative perception. Additionally, individual scripts should not be studied only in isolation, since many real-world situations involve multiple simultaneously-active scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Schank &#x0026; Abelson, 1977</xref>). New methodological approaches for studying perception in immersive real or virtual environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ladouce, Donaldson, Dudchenko, &#x0026; Ietswaart, 2017</xref>) may allow us to sample more broadly from the ever-changing mix of regularities present in our daily lives.</p>
