<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>PREMISE OF THE STUDY:</title>
<p>At the intersection of ecology and evolutionary biology, community phylogenetics can provide insights into overarching biodiversity patterns, particularly in remote and understudied ecosystems. To understand community assembly of the high-alpine flora of the Sawtooth National Forest, USA, we analyzed phylogenetic structure within and between nine summit communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS:</title>
<p>We used high-throughput sequencing to supplement existing data and infer a nearly completely sampled community phylogeny of the alpine vascular flora. We calculated mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) and mean pairwise distance (MPD) to quantify phylogenetic divergence within summits, and assed how maximum elevation explains phylogenetic structure. To evaluate similarities between summits we quantified phylogenetic turnover, taking into consideration micro-habitats (talus vs. meadows).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>KEY RESULTS:</title>
<p>We found different patterns of community phylogenetic structure within the six most species-rich orders, but across all vascular plants phylogenetic structure was largely no different from random. There was a significant negative correlation between elevation and tree-wide phylogenetic diversity (MPD) within summits: significant overdispersion degraded as elevation increased. Between summits we found high phylogenetic turnover, which was driven by greater niche heterogeneity on summits with alpine meadows.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS:</title>
<p>This study provides further evidence that stochastic processes shape the assembly of vascular plant communities in the high-alpine at regional scales. However, order-specific patterns suggest adaptations may be important for assembly of specific sectors of the plant tree of life. Further studies quantifying functional diversity will be important to disentangle the interplay of eco-evolutionary processes that likely shape broad community phylogenetic patterns in extreme environments.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In an ecological context, evolutionary history provides a useful tool for quantifying overall diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pavoine and Bonsall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Winter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jarzyna and Jetz, 2016</xref>), and a framework to address potential eco-evolutionary drivers of diversity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). On time-scaled phylogenies branch lengths quantify evolutionary time separating species, thus, more closely related species are expected to share ecologically relevant functional traits assuming such traits and niches are phylogenetically conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Webb et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cavender-Bares et al., 2009</xref>). Generally, this community phylogenetic approach is used to assess the importance of environmental filtering (&#x201C;clustering&#x201D; of closely related species within communities in a species pool) or competition defined by limiting similarity (&#x201C;overdispersion&#x201D; of distantly related species assemblages) for community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Webb, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). Alternatively, communities could be shaped by assembly processes that are species-neutral, such as colonization and local extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">MacArthur and Wilson, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hubbell, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, many complex ecological and evolutionary processes influence community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Vellend, 2010</xref>) requiring careful consideration of system-specific <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>) and cautious interpretations of the resulting community phylogenetic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mayfield and Levine, 2010</xref>). The assumption of phylogenetic niche conservation (PNC) is generally debated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Munkem&#x00FC;ller et al., 2015</xref>), and even with PNC, coexistence theory predicts competition can produce clustering if interspecific competitive hierarchy fitness differences dominate the assembly process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mayfield and Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">HilleRisLambers et al., 2012</xref>). Ideally, to interpret processes governing species coexistence, additional information about species functional traits would be used in conjunction with phylogenetic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cavender-Bares and Wilczek, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cavender-Bares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cadotte et al., 2013</xref>), especially since different traits may have different levels of conservatism or convergence depending on the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavender-Bares et al., 2006</xref>). Detailed, environmentally defined regional species surveys can be used to define environmental filtering in relation to dispersal limitation or competitive exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kraft et al., 2015</xref>), and explicitly test specific environmental, historical, biotic and neutral hypotheses to explain coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>). However, in remote and understudied ecosystems, such as the high-alpine, these data are challenging to acquire. In such cases, the community phylogenetic approach can be particularly useful for providing insights into macro-ecological and evolutionary processes driving diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>With steep environmental gradients over increasing elevation, mountains provide ideal &#x2018;natural experiments&#x2019; for understanding general patterns of biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">K&#x00F6;rner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graham et al., 2014</xref>) and adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">K&#x00F6;rner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">K&#x00F6;rner et al., 2011</xref>). Alpine regions are the only terrestrial biome with a global distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">K&#x00F6;rner, 2003</xref>), yet they represent some of the highest gaps in floristic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kier et al., 2005</xref>). This is especially concerning because ranges of alpine plants are anticipated to shift with a changing climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">K&#x00F6;rner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dullinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Morueta-Holme et al., 2015</xref>), so documenting the present floristic diversity in alpine regions is a priority. Previous studies have therefore used the &#x201C;phylogenetic-patterns-as-a-proxy&#x201D; for ecological similarity framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>) to test the hypothesis that physiologically harsh environments in the high-alpine should filter for closely related species sharing similar traits adapted to abiotic pressures, including low temperatures, extended periods of drought, and extreme ultra-violet radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">K&#x00F6;rner, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">2011</xref>). In the Hengduan Mountains Region of China, Li et al. (2014) investigated the community phylogenetic structure of alpine flora across 27 elevation belts ranging from 3000 to 5700 meters. Within sites, they found phylogenetic overdispersion at lower elevations and phylogenetic clustering at higher elevations, and the decrease in pairwise divergence was positively correlated with temperature and precipitation (more significant overdispersion with higher temperatures and precipitation; Li et al., 2014). However, at the highest elevations (above 5500 meters) phylogenetic structure became random (Li et al., 2014), possibly indicating relaxed environmental filtering between treeline and summit belts. In the Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al. (2015)</xref> assessed phylogenetic turnover between 569 plots ranging in elevation from 2195 to 3872 meters, and found that plant species were more closely related than expected (high phylogenetic clustering) overall within plots, and had a higher than expected turnover within than among plant clades between plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>). Abiotic environment defined by the elevation of individual plots explained turnover across alpine communities more than spatial distance between sites, implying a regional environmental filter and niche conservatism within clades, which was particularly strong for communities sampled East of the Continental Divide.</p>
<p>More recently, community phylogenetic studies in the high-alpine are challenging the ubiquity of abiotic constraints and environmental filtering for shaping communities. In the &#x00C9;crins National Park, France, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al. (2017)</xref> estimated phylogenetic community structure within and between 15 high-alpine summits. Species were more closely related than by chance on a few summits, but turnover between summits was lower than expected, and neutral models of colonization to and extinction within summits explained community phylogenetic structure for dominant plant orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>). In the Trans-Himalaya, Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al. (2017) found random phylogenetic diversity across phylogenetic and spatial scales, but a tendency towards overdispersion with increasing elevation, contrary to predictions of environmental filtering.</p>
<p>These contrasting patterns of community phylogenetic structure likely emerge from complex ecological and evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity in high-alpine ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graham et al., 2014</xref>), and we are far from a general characterization of elevational diversity patterns across mountain ranges for plants (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Quintero and Jetz, 2018</xref>, for birds). Mountain summits are often inhabited by globally rare or locally endemic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Smith and Cleef, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kier et al., 2009</xref>), so inferring phylogenetic relationships among species is challenging because taxa are either not represented in supertrees, or molecular sequence data is not readily available in repositories such as GenBank for mega-phylogenetic approaches. Targeted-PCR enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cronn et al., 2012</xref>), combined with high-throughput sequencing technologies, provides a solution to retrieving genetic sequence data for entire community assemblages (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Godden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Grover et al., 2012</xref>). These methods are proving useful for resolving diversity patterns within specific lineages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Uribe-Convers et al., 2016</xref>), but are not yet being applied in macro-ecological contexts. Importantly, high-throughput sequencing technologies could potentially capture intra-specific variation between communities, which has been largely unexplored in previous studies of alpine community assembly which either use supertree (Li et al., 2014) or mega-phylogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; Le Bagousse-Pinguet et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>) approaches.</p>
<p>In this study, we set out to fill a gap in our body of knowledge on high-alpine community assembly by describing the phylogenetic structure of flora across summits within a remote North American wilderness. The Sawtooth National Forest (SNF) located in south-central Idaho, USA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) is known for its immense mountainous terrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Reid, 1963</xref>) and encompasses over 200,000 acres of federally designated wilderness area. Lying within the Rocky Mountain chain, this region was formed by the tectonic uplift of the Idaho and Sawtooth batholith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kiilsgaard et al., 1970</xref>). Recent geologic episodes, including the Laramide orogeny in the late Mesozoic and extensive glaciations in the quaternary, resulted in the sharp topography and surface rock formation we currently observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Borgert et al., 1999</xref>), giving the area its namesake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kiilsgaard et al., 1970</xref>). The mountain ranges within the forest boundary include some of the most remote alpine biomes in the contiguous United States, and its alpine flora has been drastically understudied. Besides management focused efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schlatterer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harper et al., 1978)</xref>, no systematic surveys of this region have been conducted.</p>

</fig>
<p>Here, we present the first detailed floristic survey of nine high-alpine summits across three mountain ranges within the SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). From these collections, we used targeted high-throughput sequencing to supplement publicly available sequences mined from GenBank and compile a detailed molecular dataset. We used this total combined dataset to infer relationships among all species collected with a mega-phylogenetic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Roquet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Marx et al., 2016</xref>), and quantified community phylogenetic structure within and between alpine summits. To test the hypothesis that intense environmental conditions in the high-alpine filter for closely related species that are physiologically able to inhabit the high-alpine in the SNF, we correlated patterns of community phylogenetic structure with maximum elevation on each summit. Many climatic and geologic factors constitute the local environment, but elevation (a.s.l.) has been used as a proxy for increasing environmental severity of temperature and precipitation in the alpine in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Korner, 2007</xref>), and has been examined in previous studies of high-alpine community phylogenetic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Machac et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>). In central Idaho, corresponding gradients of temperature and precipitation over elevation have been shown to delimit ranges of certain endemic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Steele et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ertter and Mosely, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>If environmental filtering is structuring alpine communities, we expect a negative relationship between phylogenetic distance and maximum elevation &#x2013; closely related species should occur together more often than by chance (low pairwise phylogenetic distance) at higher elevations (assuming trait conservation for physiologically relevant traits). On the other hand, if traits are convergent or competition is strong, we expect increasing elevation to promote phylogenetic overdispersion (assuming niche conservation). Alternatively, diversity patterns might instead be explained by dispersal limitation in this island-like system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">MacArthur &#x0026; Wilson, 1967</xref>), in which case phylogenetic structure within summits is expected to be no different from random, while turnover between summits should be correlated with geographic proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>). To address how micro-habitats impact community phylogenetic structure above treeline, we separated species collected in alpine meadows from those occurring only on talus slopes. Finally, taxonomic scale is known to impact community phylogenetic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavender-Bares et al., 2006</xref>; Graham et al. 2016), and distinct clades have experienced adaptive radiations into alpine ecosystems (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hughes and Atchison, 2015</xref>). To assess how clade-specific strategies may drive community diversity, we investigated patterns across all vascular plants as well as within the six most species-rich taxonomic orders separately.</p>

<title>MATERIALS &#x0026; METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study Area and Species Collections</title>
<p>For this study, nine alpine summits were sampled from the Sawtooth, White Cloud, and Pioneer mountain ranges within the SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Collections focused on sampling alpine species, here defined as plants occurring in areas above treeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Billings and Mooney, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">K&#x00F6;rner, 2003</xref>), as this represents a major shift in climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Richardson and Friedland, 2009</xref>). Briefly, starting at the top of each summit, all aspects (as terrain allowed) were traversed down to treeline, and an individual representing each species was collected to sample the diversity, which included herbaceous plants, shrubs, and small trees, and ranged from lycophytes through angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Johnson et al., <italic>in review</italic></xref>). Specimens were pressed in the field, and leaf tissues were preserved in silica for molecular analyses. Imaging and processing of the collections were conducted at the University of Idaho Stillinger Herbarium (ID), where all voucher specimens were deposited. Identifications were made using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hitchcock and Cronquist (1973)</xref>, with nomenclature following the updated taxonomy in the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria data portal. The combined list of identified species that were collected constitutes the &#x201C;alpine species pool&#x201D; considered. Spatial Euclidean distances between summits were calculated from GPS coordinates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>High-Throughput Sequencing</title>
<p>Total genomic DNA was extracted from silica-dried leaf tissue for all collections following a modified 2x-CTAB extraction protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Doyle and Doyle, 1987</xref>). Six gene regions with varying rates of molecular evolution that are frequently employed to resolve both recent and distant phylogenetic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Soltis et al., 2011</xref>) were chosen for this study, and included representatives of the nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (<italic>atpB</italic>, <italic>matK</italic>, <italic>ndhF, rbcL</italic>, and <italic>trnTLF</italic>) genomes. For all vascular plants that were collected on each alpine summit, we used targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the six gene regions.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Universal&#x201D; primers for plant systematics were used for amplification and sequencing of all gene regions (sequences and references can be found in Appendix S1). Amplification followed a two-round PCR strategy in overlapping &#x007E;400-600 base pair (bp) amplicons to merge across the 300 bp paired-end reads generated with Illumina MiSeq sequencing, so some gene regions (<italic>atpB</italic>, <italic>matK</italic>, <italic>ndhF,</italic> and <italic>trnTLF</italic>) were amplified in multiple segments (Appendix S1). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Uribe-Convers et al. (2016)</xref>, each target-specific primer sequence contained a conserved sequence tag that was added to the 5&#x2032; end at the time of oligonucleotide synthesis (CS1 for forward primers and CS2 for reverse primers). The purpose of the added CS1 and CS2 tails is to provide an annealing site for the second pair of primers. After an initial round of PCR using the CS-tagged, target specific primers (PCR1), a second round of PCR was used to add 8 bp sample-specific barcodes and high-throughput sequencing adapters to both the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of each PCR amplicon (PCR2). From 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;, the PCR2 primers included the reverse complement of the conserved sequence tags, sample-specific 8 bp barcodes, and either Illumina P5 (CS1-tagged forward primers) or P7 (CS2-tagged reverse primers) sequencing adapters. Sequences for the CS1 and CS2 conserved sequence tags, barcodes, and sequencing adapters were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Uribe-Convers et al. (2016)</xref>. PCR conditions were as follows: PCR1 &#x2013; 25 ul reactions included 2.5 ul of 10x PCR buffer, 3 ul of 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.30 ul of 20 mg/ml BSA, 1 ul of 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.125 ul of 10 uM CS1-tagged target specific forward primer, 0.125 ul of 10 uM CS2-tagged target specific reverse primer, 0.125 ul of 5000 U/ml Taq DNA polymerase, 1 ul template of DNA, and PCR-grade H<sub>2</sub>O to volume; PCR1 cycling conditions - 95&#x00B0;C for 2 min. followed by 20 cycles of 95&#x00B0;C for 2 min., 50-60&#x00B0;C for 1 min. (depending on T<sub>m</sub> of target specific primers), 68&#x00B0;C for 1 min., followed by a final extension of 68&#x00B0;C for 10 min.; PCR2 &#x2013; 20 ul reactions included 2 ul of 10x PCR buffer, 3.6 ul of 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.60 ul of 20 mg/ml BSA, 0.40 ul of 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.75 ul of 2 uM barcoded primer mix, 0.125 ul of 5000 U/ml Taq DNA polymerase, 1 ul of PCR1 product as template, and PCR-grade H<sub>2</sub>O to volume; PCR2 cycling conditions &#x2212; 95&#x00B0;C for 1 min. followed by 15 cycles of 95&#x00B0;C for 30 sec., 60&#x00B0;C for 30 sec., 68&#x00B0;C for 1 min., followed by a final extension of 68&#x00B0;C for 5 min. Following PCR2, the resulting amplicons were pooled together and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using 300 bp paired end reads and 1&#x0025; of a sequencing lane.</p>
<p>Pooled reads from the Illumina MiSeq runs were demultiplexed using the dbcAmplicons pipeline, and consensus sequences were generated using the R script reduce_amplicons.R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/msettles/dbcAmplicons">https://github.com/msettles/dbcAmplicons</ext-link>) following the workflow detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Uribe-Convers et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, for each sample, read-pairs were identified, sample-specific dual-barcodes and target specific primers were identified and removed (allowing the default matching error of 4 bases), and each read was annotated to include the species name and read number for the gene region. To eliminate fungal contamination that may have been amplified with ITS, and non-specific amplification of poor PCR products for all gene regions, each read was screened against a user-defined reference file of annotated sequences retrieved from GenBank (using the &#x201C;-screen&#x201D; option in dbcAmplicons). Reads that mapped with default sensitivity settings were kept. Each read was reduced to the most frequent length variant, paired reads that overlapped by at least 10 bp (default) were merged into a single continuous sequence, and a consensus sequence without ambiguities was produced (&#x201C;-p consensus&#x201D; in the R script reduce_amplicons.R). Paired reads that did not overlap were concatenated using the program <italic>Phyutility</italic> version 2.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Smith and Dunn, 2008</xref>), and any merged segments were added to the concatenated reads.</p>
<p>Processed MiSeq sequences for each gene region were aligned using <italic>MAFFT</italic> version 7.273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) with default settings, and segments that were divided for PCR amplification were aligned separately.

Incorrect sequences (those whose BLAST hit did not match with the species and/or gene region identification) were discarded and the segment was realigned. Each gene segment was then concatenated using <italic>Phyutility</italic> version 2.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Smith and Dunn, 2008</xref>), resulting in a final alignment for each gene region. To avoid replication for gene regions that were amplified in multiple segments, the overlapping region was removed from one segment prior to concatenation.</p>

<title>Community Phylogenetic Structure</title>
<p>Evolutionary relationships estimated from the SNF community phylogeny were used to summarize phylogenetic patterns within (&#x03B1;-diversity) the nine alpine summit communities sampled for all vascular plants (Tracheophyta), as well as the six most species-rich orders. We calculated the mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) and the mean pairwise distance (MPD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Webb, 2000</xref>), to quantify divergence at fine and broad phylogenetic scales, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mazel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tucker et al., 2016</xref>). We assessed if observed phylogenetic patterns were different from a random expectation by calculating standardized effect sizes (SES) for each metric in the R package <italic>picante</italic> 1.6-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kembel et al., 2010</xref>) by randomly resampling each community phylogeny 10,000 times (random draw null model). Large SES values indicate greater than expected observed phylogenetic divergence from the species pool of alpine flora within the SNF (phylogenetic overdispersion), while small values indicated observed divergence is less than expected (phylogenetic clustering).</p>
<p>Changes in community phylogenetic structure between summits (&#x03B2;-diversity) were summarized with two different metrics. First, we calculated the unique branch length contribution relative to the total branch lengths shared between each community with the UniFrac index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lozupone and Knight, 2005</xref>), which has been used to quantify turnover in other studies of alpine phylogenetic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>). This broad measure of phylogenetic divergence between sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baselga, 2009</xref>) does not discern between richness gradients of species-poor communities nested within species-rich communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wright and Reeves, 1992</xref>) or spatial turnover, whereby environmental filtering or historical processes cause distinct lineages to replace others between sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Qian et al., 2005</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Leprieur et al. (2012)</xref>, we decomposed UniFrac to separate the phylogenetic divergence between summits attributed to accumulation of species richness (UniFrac PD) from divergences that represent true gain or loss of species due to replacement (UniFrac Turn). SES of UniFrac indices were quantified by comparing observed values to a null distribution of indices from tips shuffled across the community phylogeny using the R code provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Leprieur et al. (2012)</xref>. Second, we identified nodes within the community phylogeny where species or clades of species were contributing to turnover with PI<italic>st</italic>, which measures changes in mean phylogenetic distances between sites compared to within sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hardy and Senterre, 2007</xref>). We used a randomization that shuffles species across the community phylogeny (&#x2018;1s&#x2019;) to test significance of the phylogenetic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hardy, 2008</xref>) with the R package <italic>spacodiR</italic> version 0.13.0115 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eastman et al., 2011</xref>). PI<italic>st</italic> &#x003E; 0 indicates spatial phylogenetic clustering (species within plots are more closely related than between plots), while PI<italic>st</italic> &#x003C; 0 indicates spatial phylogenetic overdispersion (species within plots are less closely related than between plots; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hardy and Senterre, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>To test for environmental filtering of closely related species, we assessed the relationship between patterns of phylogenetic divergence and elevation. Within summits, we used simple linear regression with SES MNTD and SES MPD as the dependent variables, and maximum elevation as the independent variable.

Each compositional pairwise &#x03B2;-diversity matrix was correlated with environmental difference (elevation) and spatial distance using multiple regression on matrices (MRM; nperm &#x003D; 999) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lichstein, 2007</xref>) as implemented in the R package &#x2018;<italic>ecodist&#x2019;</italic> version 1.2.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goslee and Urban, 2007</xref>). On summits with high-alpine meadows, we assessed if niche heterogeneity was driving patterns of phylogenetic divergence by removing species collected in meadows and comparing SES MNTD and SES MPD of species collected only on talus slopes (&#x201C;Talus&#x201D;) with all species collected above treeline together (&#x201C;All Alpine&#x201D;) using a paired <italic>t-</italic>test.

<p>Because we used universal primers that were designed primarily for angiosperms and/or seed plant systematics, there was taxonomic variation (and biases) in the efficacy of amplification and/or sequencing of each gene region, and none of the ferns or lycophytes amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>High-alpine ecosystems across the remote Sawtooth National Forest in North America are comprised of a diverse array of vascular plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), dominated by species in the orders Asterales, Caryophyllales, Poales, Lamiales, Brassicales, and Ericales. Over-representation of species from these specific clades contributes to the only significant pattern in community phylogenetic structure across vascular plants that we found: tree-wide overdispersion on one summit (MPD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Otherwise, tip-wise phylogenetic structure was no different from random across all vascular plants (MNTD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The influence of taxonomic scale on patterns of community phylogenetic structure has been well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Emerson and Gillespie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Vamosi et al., 2009</xref>), and when source pools are defined more broadly, communities tend to be more phylogenetically clustered than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavender-Bares et al., 2006</xref>). This pattern was confirmed here, as significant phylogenetic clustering was only ever found within specific clades on a few summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Still overall, significant order-specific phylogenetic structure was idiosyncratic and sparse, suggesting clade-specific community assembly mechanisms.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that extreme environments filter for closely related species in the high-alpine, we investigated the relationship between these community phylogenetic patterns and maximum elevation. We predicted that the physiologically extreme environment is filtering for closely related species driving observed diversity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Billings and Mooney 1968</xref>), as has been found in previous studies of community phylogenetic structure in the high-alpine (Li et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>). Results did show that elevation was significantly correlated with MPD across vascular plants and within the order Poales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). While the summits at lower elevations were comprised of plant assemblages that were more distantly related than expected, phylogenetic structure of summits at higher elevations was not significantly different than a random sample of the alpine species pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This significant negative relationship between MPD and elevation suggests that the environment may be shaping community-wide assembly in the high-alpine of the SNF, but not towards significant clustering of close relative with shared derived traits adapted to extreme alpine conditions, as expected. Instead, phylogenetic structure shifted from significantly overdispersed on summits with lower maximum elevation to each species having an equal probability of co-occurring at higher maximum elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). While not significant, this trend also held for the orders Lamiales and Brassicales.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a positive trend between maximum elevation and MNTD was found overall (across vascular plants and within most orders), but was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As elevation increased, tip-wise phylogenetic distances increased. If traits are conserved, overdispersion of distantly related species is sometimes interpreted to result from competition in the community phylogenetics framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Webb, 2000</xref>). However, if ecologically relevant traits are convergent, habitat filtering is instead expected to produce phylogenetic overdispersion. Significant phylogenetic overdispersion was also found within the order Caryophyllales for tree-wide distances, and MPD was positively related with maximum elevation for the Caryophyllales, Asterales, and Ericales, though not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Globally these orders, and the Caryophyllales in particular, are known to contain many species with a cushion life form, suggesting frequent evolutionary convergence toward this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boucher et al., 2016</xref>), and could explain the overdispersion found here. Niche or habitat heterogeneity could also allow distantly related species to fill space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Stein et al., 2014</xref>), and promote phylogenetic overdispersion. Despite higher species richness on summits with alpine meadows, habitat heterogeneity did not drive patterns of community phylogenetic structure within summits (Appendix S6). Between summits, high turnover of phylogenetic diversity does appear to be attributable to plants found in high-alpine meadows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Species within the genus <italic>Eriogonum</italic> and across the Eurosids were found uniquely distributed across space (spatial overdispersion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5b</xref>), which might indicate specific niche preferences in these lineages. Taken together, patterns of phylogenetic structure within and between summit communities suggest functional trait convergence and niche differentiation promote the co-occurrence of distant lineages at high elevations in the SNF, but further work detailing traits and environmental conditions will be necessary to support this.</p>
<p>Besides adaptation, species-neutral processes are expected to shape biodiversity in island-like systems, such as high-alpine summits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">MacArthur &#x0026; Wilson, 1967</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study simulated communities under different assembly processes, and revealed how overdispersion can also be caused by stochastic processes, such as local extinction or limited dispersal following allopatric speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pigot and Etienne, 2015</xref>). In fact, since allopatric speciation has been shown to drive communities towards overdispersion, clustering should be difficult to detect at all under the random-draw null model (implemented here), unless rates of extinction are high enough to decouple from allopatric speciation, the source pool itself was completely formed by colonization, or the source pool was poorly sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pigot and Etienne, 2015</xref>). The lack of significant phylogenetic clustering across vascular plants coupled with largely random phylogenetic structure at the highest maximum elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) could signify the importance of such stochastic assembly processes in central Idaho.</p>
<p>Further south in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, phylogenetic clustering of closely related species within alpine summits was found (for MPD), and environment explained high turnover within clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>). While part of the same greater mountain range, it is possible that scale-effects explain the differences in phylogenetic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavender-Bares et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we defined communities at the summit-level (everything occurring about tree-line), while in Colorado, communities were defined at the plot-level (approximately 400m<sup>2</sup> in area). At a similar spatial scale (summit-level) in in the French Alps, however, few summits were significantly clustered (for either MNTD or MPD), and phylogenetic structure was not explained by a series of environmental variables that were tested (including elevation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, models explicitly accounting for species-neutral assembly processes such as colonization and local extinction were able to explain phylogenetic patterns, providing further support that these processes play an important role in shaping diversity at this regional scale. But clade-specific patterns differ between Idaho and France&#x2014;phylogenetic patterns within the Poales mirrored the negative relationship found for MPD across vascular plants in the SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>), while environmental conditions were mostly found to drive clustering within the Caryophyllales in the French Alps. The architecture of these alpine ranges is incredibly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">K&#x00F6;rner at al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Elsen and Tingley, 2015</xref>), and factors such as the age of mountain orogeny, bioclimatic belts or the extent of dynamic glacial histories should be considered in greater detail to compare cross-continental community phylogenetic relationships, and more rigorously test biogeographic hypotheses of how historic biogeographic processes shape the evolution and ecology of alpine biodiversity globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graham et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>While not a primary goal of this study, we were also able to compare how community phylogenetic structure estimated from the total combined dataset differs from estimates of community phylogenetic structure from molecular sequence data obtained from 1) GenBank alone, which are openly available but have sampling gaps for species and gene regions, and 2) high-throughput sequencing alone, which can introduce sampling biases depending upon the gene regions targeted for amplification. Mining GenBank for names of high-alpine species collected from our survey, we found only 74&#x0025; were represented by publicly available molecular sequence data. While these archives have proven useful for comparisons of alpine community phylogenetic structure at macro-ecological scales (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>), the impact of taxon sampling on quantification and interpretations of community phylogenetic patterns is of growing concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Park et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we leveraged a targeted high-throughput sequencing approach recently developed for plant systematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cronn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Godden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Grover et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Uribe-Convers et al., 2016</xref>) to directly sample the genetic diversity of all individuals collected across the nine summits sampled. These novel molecular sequences captured phylogenetic relationships for 93&#x0025; of the alpine plant species that were collected throughout the region. Importantly, molecular sequences for 422 individuals captured some intraspecific genetic structure between summits, which is not possible when a single sample is used to represent species diversity (as in the GenBank and total combined datasets). However, the taxonomic specificity of the primer pairs used for amplification was biased towards seed-producing vascular plants (i.e., excluded ferns and lycophytes). Including primers that are optimized for these groups would be more effective for documenting the complete flora, and has great potential for exploring infra-specific genetic structure in future studies. By combining the datasets, we were able to supplement taxonomic gaps in the high-throughput dataset with publicly available molecular sequence data from GenBank, resulting in a nearly complete (96&#x0025;) species-level phylogenetic representation of the alpine flora.</p>
<p>Using a paired <italic>t-</italic>test to compare SES MNTD and SES MPD calculated from each dataset, greater differences of community phylogenetic structure were found between the total combined dataset and the high-throughput dataset than between the total and GenBank datasets (Appendix S9). Compared with the total dataset, community phylogenetic structure in the high-throughput dataset (when the ferns and lycophytes were excluded) moved from neutral towards overdispersion for MNTD (Tracheophyta <italic>P</italic>-value &#x003D; 0.0285; Appendix S9a), and from overdispersion towards neutral for MPD (Appendix S9b). Because the high-throughput and GenBank datasets had similar proportions of missing data (71&#x0025; and 70&#x0025;, respectively; Appendix S4), this suggests that the similarity in results between the GenBank and total datasets (Appendix S9) are driven by the inclusion of ferns and allies, rather than missing data. The contribution of long branches introduced by these groups could also inflate community-wide patterns (MPD), especially considering the relatively high occurrence of ferns and gymnosperms on the peak with significant overdispersion (Horstmann Peak; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>This and other studies (e.g. Li et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Marx et al., 2017</xref>; Le Bagousse-Pingueta et al., 2017) demonstrate the potential for patterns of phylogenetic diversity to elucidate dominant processes driving species co-occurrence in extreme regions, however many assumptions about functional trait evolution and community assembly processes have the potential to be violated when evolutionary relationships are used as a proxy for ecological niche similarity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>). Rather than viewing phylogenetic patterns as a proxy for ecological similarity and accepting the myriad of underlying assumptions, community phylogenetic diversity has strong potential to inform how macroevolutionary processes shape the diversity of multi-species assemblages we observe across space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>). Because alpine ecosystems are found on every continent, patterns of phylogenetic community structure can be compared globally to assess how rates of diversification constrain (or promote) alpine diversity. However, a central challenge for moving towards investigating macroevolutionary drivers of community phylogenetic patterns (the &#x201C;phylogenetic-patterns-as-a-cause&#x201D; approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>) is that more studies across lineage-pools are necessary to compare across alpine regions. In this work, we demonstrate how supplementing available molecular sequence data with novel sequences generated using a high-throughput approach efficiently resolved phylogenetic community structure across remote summits, which could be tractable to other high-elevation ecosystems facing a similar deficit in molecular sequence data for community phylogeny inference. The ability to effectively sequence multiple gene regions from hundreds of plant species at a time also presents an opportunity to capture intraspecific genetic variation of multi-species assemblages across regions. Investigating signatures of selection at the population level could provide deeper insights into the mechanistic basis underlying patterns of community phylogenetic structure, such as the evolution of key traits or life forms that are important for survival at these extremes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boucher et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, this high-throughput sequencing approach is extendable across taxonomic lineages, presenting exciting avenues for community phylogenetic networks of plants with associated pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pellissier et al., 2013</xref>) or microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bryant et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the power to detect environmental filtering increases with the size of the species pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kraft et al., 2007</xref>). The targeted high-throughput sequencing approach presented here could be used to supplement available sequence data and sample larger source pools to more explicitly test stochastic models of species-neutral colonization and local extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pigot and Etienne, 2015</xref>) and the relative importance of adaptive and species-neutral processes for generating and maintaining biodiversity in the high-alpine.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Mountains are ideal for testing how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms shape the diversity patterns we observe across space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graham et al., 2014</xref>), but the extreme environmental conditions that define high-alpine areas and open many questions about how this diversity has assembled also pose a challenge to research efforts, so comparisons among regions remain limited. Collections from the first detailed floristic survey of nine summits across the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho, USA, contribute to our global synthesis of montane biodiversity, and community phylogenetic relationships from combined novel and publicly available molecular sequence data show patterns of increasing phylogenetic stochasticity over an elevation gradient. While we interpret these results as an indication that the environment may not be a broad selective force across the vascular plant community as a whole at high elevations, we recognize that elevation gradients are comprised of complex geographic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">K&#x00F6;rner, 2007</xref>), and regional distinctions of specific climatic and topological properties will be important for global comparisons in the future. Clade-specific signatures of phylogenetic clustering indicate that environmental filtering may be more important for certain branches of the tree of life than others, and trends toward phylogenetic overdispersion over increasing elevation suggest that traits important for functioning in the high-alpine may have converged in different lineages. Aggregating functional and phylogenetic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cadotte et al., 2013</xref>) will be useful in future studies to assess convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cavender-Bares et al., 2006</xref>), and differentiate between the complex drivers of diversity across taxonomic levels.</p>
