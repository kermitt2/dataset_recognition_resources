<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>In response to nutrient deprivation, the cell needs to mobilize an extensive amount of membrane to form and grow the autophagosome, allowing the progression of autophagy. By providing membranes and a source for LC3 lipidation, COPII (Coat Protein Complex II) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and promotes autophagosome biogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that, in response to starvation, divert COPII from the secretory pathway to the autophagic pathway are largely unknown. Here, we show that the F-box protein FBXW5 targets SEC23B, a component of COPII, for proteasomal degradation and that this event limits the autophagic flux in the presence of nutrients. In response to starvation, ULK1 phosphorylates SEC23B on Serine 186, preventing the interaction of SEC23B with FBXW5 and, therefore, inhibiting its degradation. Phosphorylated and stabilized SEC23B associates with SEC24A and SEC24B, but not SEC24C and SEC24D, and they re-localize to the ERGIC, promoting autophagic flux. Induction of autophagy and localization of both SEC23B and SEC24B to the ERGIC in response to nutrient deprivation are significantly reduced in SEC23B(S186A) knock-in cells. We propose that, in the presence of nutrients, FBXW5 limits COPII-mediated autophagosome biogenesis. Inhibition of this event by ULK1 ensures efficient execution of the autophagic cascade in response to nutrient starvation.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Macro-autophagy (more commonly referred to as autophagy) is a highly conserved process present in all eukaryotes, which allows the degradation of proteins and organelles by lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>). It is characterized by the formation of the double-membraned autophagosome that transports cytoplasmic cargos to lysosomes, where the autophagic cargo is subjected to degradation. In a simplistic way, autophagy can be classified into &#x201C;basal&#x201D; and &#x201C;induced&#x201D;. The former is used to maintain cellular homeostasis by promoting the turnover of cytoplasmic components, and the latter is part of the cellular response to stressors (<italic>e.g.,</italic> to produce amino acids upon nutrient deprivation). Due to its role in many cellular processes, it is not surprising that deregulation of autophagy plays a role in many human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jiang and Mizushima, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rybstein et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The UNC51-like kinase 1 [ULK1, AKA autophagy-related (ATG) protein ATG1] is a master regulator of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dankert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mizushima, 2010</xref>). Specifically, in response to nutrient starvation or mTOR inhibition, ULK1 is activated and, in turn, this leads to enhanced activity of the autophagy-specific class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complex, which is comprised of VPS34 (AKA PIK3C3), p150 (AKA VPS15 and PIK3R4), BECLIN-1 (AKA ATG6), and ATG14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>). The activation of the PI3KC3 complex results in the production of PI(3)P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate), which is necessary for the recruitment of downstream effectors and the subsequent nucleation of the autophagosome. Next, two consecutive ubiquitylation-like reactions catalyzed by certain ATG proteins mediate the attachment of phosphatidylethanolamine to LC3 family proteins (commonly referred to as LC3 lipidation), promoting the expansion and closure of the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). Originally, it was thought that the autophagosome only derives from mobile cytoplasmic vesicles characterized by the transmembrane protein ATG9, which are recruited to the ER. However, it has become clear that, in response to starvation, additional sources of membrane are necessary for the formation and growth of the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Davis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The coat protein complex II (COPII) is a multi-subunit protein complex essential for the transport of cellular cargos from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromme et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zanetti et al., 2011</xref>). A key component of COPII is SEC23, whose importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis is highlighted by the fact that mutations in the two SEC23 paralogs (SEC23A and SEC23B) cause the human genetic diseases cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boyadjiev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>). The other components of COPII are SEC13, SEC24, SEC31, and SAR1.</p>
<p>COPII vesicles emerge from specialized domains of the ER called ER exit sites (ERES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zanetti et al., 2011</xref>). However, in response to starvation, when the secretory pathway is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2014;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zacharogianni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>) and there is an urgent need for membranes to form autophagosomes, ERES enlarge and patches along the ERGIC to function in autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Davis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sanchez-Wandelmer et al., 2015</xref>). In mammals, disruption of ERES inhibits autophagosome biogenesis at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stadel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zoppino et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, in response to nutrient starvation, the PI3KC3 complex, which is activated by ULK1, promotes the recruitment of COPII components to the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Karanasios et al., 2016</xref>). Next, specialized COPII vesicles budding from the ERGIC act as precursors for LC3 lipidation, a critical step in autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). The functions of COPII in the autophagic pathway are conserved along evolution. In fact, in response to starvation, yeast COPII components physically interact with core elements required for autophagy, and COPII vesicles provide membrane sources for the growing autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ishihara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lemus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Reggiori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). However, how the components of COPII vesicles are regulated in response to nutrient deprivation to allow their contribution to autophagosome biogenesis is largely unknown.</p>
<p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system is necessary for the precise spatiotemporal degradation of numerous key cellular regulators, and the selectivity of this process is determined by a large family of ubiquitin ligases. SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) complexes form a family of multi-subunit ubiquitin ligases, which, in turn, is part of the super-family of Cullin-Ring Ligases (CRLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2014</xref>). In human, 69 F-box proteins act as the substrate receptor subunits of SCF ubiquitin ligases, allowing the regulation of hundreds of substrate proteins. Thus, SCFs control a multitude of cellular processes whose deregulation is implicated in many pathologies, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frescas and Pagano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>

<title>FBXW5 binds SEC23B and promotes its proteasomal degradation</title>
<p>To identify SCF<sup>FBXW5</sup> substrates, Streptag-FLAG (SF)-tagged FBXW5 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and affinity purified for analysis by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Florens and Washburn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>). MudPIT revealed the presence of peptides corresponding to SKP1 and CUL1 (as expected), as well as 15 unique peptides derived from the COPII coat subunit SEC23B (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1118">http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1118</ext-link>). To confirm the binding between SEC23B and FBXW5 and its specificity, we screened a panel of nine human F-box proteins. SF-tagged F-box proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells and affinity precipitated to evaluate their interaction with SEC23B. We found that FBXW5 was the only F-box protein capable of co-precipitating with endogenous SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we investigated whether SEC23B is targeted for proteolysis by FBXW5. Expression of wild-type FBXW5 resulted in a reduction in the levels of both endogenous and exogenous SEC23B, as detected by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref>). This reduction depended on the ability of FBXW5 to form an active SCF complex as demonstrated by the observation that the expression of FBXW5(&#x0394;F), a mutant in which the F-box domain was deleted, did not affect SEC23B protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, either co-expression with dominant negative (DN)-CUL1 (a mutant of CUL1 lacking its C-terminus, which retains the binding to F-box proteins and SKP1, but not to the catalytic subunit RBX1) or addition of MLN4924 (a NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor used to inhibit the activity of SCFs) blocked the FBXW5-dependent degradation of SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, although it has been reported that FBXW5 can form a functional CRL4<sup>FBXW5</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frescas and Pagano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), co-expression of a CUL4 dominant negative mutant (DN-CUL4) did not interfere with the FBXW5-dependent degradation of SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The observed reduction of SEC23B protein levels upon FBXW5 transfection was rescued also by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating that the decrease in SEC23B levels was due to proteasome-mediated proteolysis.</p>
<p>To confirm that FBXW5 regulates the degradation of SEC23B, we used RNA interference to reduce FBXW5 expression. Depleting FBXW5 using three different siRNA oligos (each individually) induced an increase in both the steady state-levels and the stability of endogenous SEC23B in two different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results indicate that FBXW5 controls the proteasome-mediated degradation of SEC23B.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, SEC23B is a fundamental component of COPII vesicles, and therefore it interacts with several COPII-vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromme et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, immunopurified FBXW5 does not co-precipitate other COPII vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1118">http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1118</ext-link>), suggesting that the subpopulation of SEC23B interacting with FBXW5 is not integrated within COPII vesicles. SEC23B and SEC24 proteins form tight heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromme et al., 2008</xref>); therefore, we reasoned that FBXW5 and SEC24 proteins might compete for the binding to SEC23B. To examine this possibility, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with FBXW5 and increasing amounts of SEC24B and subjected the resulting lysates to affinity purification.</p>
<p>In line with our hypothesis, increasing concentrations of SEC24B resulted in a marked decrease in the binding of endogenous SEC23B to FBXW5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Consistent with an impaired interaction between SEC23B and FBXW5, increasing amounts of SEC24B also induced an increase in the levels of endogenous SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that SEC23B cannot simultaneously bind to FBXW5 and SEC24B, suggesting that these two proteins compete for the same binding region on SEC23B. In agreement with this model, using a panel of SEC23B deletion mutants, we found that the binding to FBXW5 is mediated by the TRUNK domain of SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1D-F</xref>), which has been shown to mediate the SEC23-SEC24 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>). In fact, SEC23B(100-767), a deletion mutant containing the TRUNK domain, was able to co-precipitate endogenous FBXW5, whereas SEC23B(400-767), a mutant missing the TRUNK domain, was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we used an immobilized synthetic peptide containing the previously reported SEC24-interacting sequence of SEC23B (a.a. 180-194 in human, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>) and tested its ability to bind endogenous FBXW5 present in cellular extracts. While the immobilized SEC23B peptide efficiently bound FBXW5, it failed to pull down other F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that this 14-amino acid region is sufficient for the binding to FBXW5.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that FBXW5 and SEC24B associate with SEC23B in a mutually exclusive fashion and may compete for the same binding region in SEC23B.</p>

<title>ULK1 phosphorylates SEC23B on Serine 186 that is present in the binding motif for FBXW5 and SEC24</title>
<p>The interactions between most F-box proteins and their cognate substrates are often regulated by post-translational modifications (most often phosphorylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we looked for phosphorylation consensus sequences for known kinases within the FBXW5-binding region of SEC23B and found that Serine 186 (S186) is part of a highly conserved ULK1 phosphorylation motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Egan et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2A-B</xref>). We first investigated whether S186 is phosphorylated in cells. To this end, we generated a phospho-specific antibody against a peptide (a.a. 180-194) containing phosphorylated Serine at position 186. This antibody specifically detected the phosphopeptide, but not the unphosphorylated peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2C</xref>). Moreover, it recognized both wild-type SEC23B and a SEC23B(S186D) mutant (which mimics Ser186 phosphorylation), but not the SEC23B(S186A) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2D</xref>), providing evidence that SEC23B is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> on S186.</p>
<p>Next, to test whether Ser186 on SEC23B can serve as a phospho-acceptor for ULK1, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type SEC23B together with either wild type ULK1 or a kinase-dead (KD) mutant. Only wild-type ULK1 induced the phosphorylation of both endogenous and exogenous SEC23B on S186, as detected with our phospho-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2E</xref>) (endogenous phosphorylated SEC23B was detected in whole cell extracts, and exogenous phosphorylated SEC23B was detected in both in cell extracts and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates). In contrast, in cells expressing SEC23B(S186A), only endogenous SEC23B was phosphorylated by ULK1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2E</xref>). We further confirmed that SEC23B is an ULK1 substrate by using purified proteins in an <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2F</xref>). Moreover, addition of a specific ULK1 inhibitor, SBI-0206965, blocked ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous SEC23B in a dose-dependent manner, similar to what observed for ATG13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), a canonical substrate of ULK1.</p>

<p>Next, we studied how nutrient deprivation, a condition that activates ULK1, modulates the phosphorylation of SEC23B on S186. After substituting the growth medium, which contains 10&#x0025; fetal bovine serum, with Earle&#x2019;s balanced salt solution (EBSS), we observed a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of endogenous SEC23B as well as two other known substrates of ULK1, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by treating cells with SBI-0206965 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2G</xref>).</p>
<p>We concluded that, in response to starvation, ULK1 phosphorylates SEC23B on S186.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of SEC23B inhibits its interaction with and degradation via FBXW5</title>
<p>To investigate whether phosphorylation on S186 affects the SEC23B-FBXW5 interaction, we used a phosphorylated version of the synthetic peptide employed for the binding experiments. While the non-phosphorylated peptide efficiently bound FBXW5, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>), a corresponding peptide containing phosphorylated Ser186 displayed a strongly reduced ability to bind FBXW5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2H</xref>). This indicates that Ser186 phosphorylation inhibits the interaction between these two proteins, in agreement with the fact that the binding of FBXW5 to the phospho-mimetic SEC23B(S186D) mutant is abolished, while FBXW5 binding to SEC23B(S186A) is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Accordingly, endogenous SEC23B phosphorylated on Ser186 was not affinity purified with FBXW5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Similarly, upon nutrient deprivation (when SE23B becomes phosphorylated on Ser186) the interaction between FBXW5 and SEC23B decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2I</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the observed impaired interaction with FBXW5, the levels of SEC23B(S186D) did not decrease in the presence of FBXW5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F</xref>) and it exhibited a longer half-life than wild-type SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results suggest that ULK1 phosphorylates Ser186 in SEC23B, inhibiting its interaction with and degradation via FBXW5. Concurring with this hypothesis, silencing of ULK1, but not ULK2, reduced the levels of SEC23B phosphorylated on Ser186 and induced a decrease in the levels of endogenous SEC23B in starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2J</xref>). Moreover, co-silencing FBXW5 rescued the decrease in SEC23B levels induced by the depletion of ULK1 but did not alter the amount of phosphorylated SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref>), confirming that ULK1 and FBXW5 have an antagonistic effect on the control of SEC23B protein abundance.</p>
<p>Significantly, although Ser186 is located at the interface between the SEC23 and SEC24 heterodimer binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig. S1F</xref>) and its phosphorylation blocks the SEC23B-FBXW5 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>), both the phosphomimetic SEC23B(S186D) mutant and the endogenous phosphorylated SEC23B interacted with SEC24A, SEC24B, and SEC13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2K-L</xref>). In addition, both wild-type SEC23B and phospho-mimetic SEC23B(S186D) efficiently bound to the small GTPase SAR1(H79G), a GTP-bound SAR1 mutant that is constitutively associated with COPII vesicles, but not with the cytosolic GDP-bound SAR1(T39N) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Venditti et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. S2M</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results indicate that the ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of SEC23B blocks its FBXW5-dependent degradation but does not interfere with either the formation of the SEC23B-SEC24 heterodimer or its recruitment to the COPII vesicle coat by SAR1.</p>

<title>The FBXW5-mediated degradation of SEC23B limits the autophagic flux in the presence of nutrients</title>
<p>Since ULK1 plays an essential role in the induction of autophagy, and since COPII proteins, in addition to their role in secretion, are also required for the proper execution of the autophagic program (see Introduction), we investigated whether the ULK1-dependent regulation of the interaction between FBXW5 and SEC23B regulates the autophagic flux. Automated quantification of both endogenous LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and exogenous GFP-LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>) showed that the LC3 puncta area increased upon FBXW5 downregulation in cells grown in the presence of nutrients. Measurement of area of LC3-positive puncta was preferred to individual number of puncta per cell because clustering of the vesicular compartments in some images made delineation of individual vesicles inaccurate. The increase in LC3-positive puncta could in principle reflect either an increase in autophagic activity or an impairment in the lysosome-dependent degradation of lipidated LC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>). Compared to untreated cells, treatment of FBXW5-depleted cells with bafilomycin A1, a proton ATPase inhibitor that blocks the degradation of lipidated LC3 but not the formation of autophagosomes, significantly increased LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>), suggesting that depletion of FBXW5 increases autophagic flux during unstressed conditions (<italic>i.e.,</italic> it increases basal autophagy). Consistent with this hypothesis, FBXW5 downregulation did not induce a further increase in the appearance of LC3 puncta upon induction of autophagy by nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we used a tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 construct (mCherry-GFP-LC3) that allows monitoring autophagosome maturation as a change from green&#x002B;red double (<italic>i.e.,</italic> yellow) florescence vesicles (autophagosomes) to vesicles that fluoresce only in red (autolysosomes) due to GFP-fluorescence quenching at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klionsky et al., 2016</xref>). Using this method, we demonstrated that the majority of LC3 puncta that accumulated upon FBXW5 depletion were autolysosomes and not autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>), further confirming that increased levels of SEC23B promotes autophagic flux.</p>
<p>Importantly, co-depletion of SEC23B almost completely prevented the increase in autophagy mediated by FBXW5 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, expression of SEC23B(S186D) significantly induced higher levels of LC3 puncta compared to wild-type SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Ser186 in SEC23B is necessary for its localization to the ERGIC and an efficient autophagic response upon nutrient deprivation</title>
<p>The ERGIC compartment produces vesicles that are active for LC3 lipidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). We found that, whereas upon starvation wild-type SEC23B colocalized approximately twice more with the ERGIC membrane marker ERGIC53, the localization of SEC23B(S186A) did not change after nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Notably, SEC23B(S186D) colocalization with ERGIC53 was already high in the presence of nutrients. Accordingly, compared to wild-type SEC23B, SEC23B(S186D) co-distributed approximately twice more with the ERGIC membrane marker ERGIC53 in fractionated membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3C</xref>). Finally, evaluation of the secretory pathway by assaying secreted Gaussia Luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Badr et al., 2007</xref>) indicated that overexpression of either SEC23B(S186D) or ULK1, but not wild-type SEC23B, SEC23B(S186A) or ULK1-KD, resulted in an inhibition of secretion in the presence of nutrients, similarly to what observed when cells are staved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggest that ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of SEC23B promotes both its localization to the ERGIC and its autophagic function, possibly to the expense of its secretory function.</p>
<p>Next, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-dependent strategy to generate A375 cells in which all three alleles of <italic>SEC23B</italic> were mutated to SEC23B(S186A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3F</xref>). In contrast to wild-type SEC23B, levels of SEC23B(S186A) did not increase upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Significantly, automated quantification of endogenous LC3 showed that, in contrast to parental cells, nutrient deprivation-induced autophagy was strongly reduced in SEC23B(S186A) knock-in cells, while basal autophagy remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>). We also evaluated the turnover of p62, a cargo adaptor and substrate of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>). In response to starvation, p62 was degraded in parental cells but not in SEC23B(S186A) knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>The above results indicate that the presence of Ser186 in SEC23B and, presumably, its phosphorylation and consequent stabilization are required for the proper induction of autophagy in response to starvation.</p>

<title>SEC24A/B, but not SEC24C/D, specifically associate with phosphorylated SEC23B and contribute to autophagy</title>
<p>Vertebrates express four SEC24 paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromme et al., 2008</xref>), but it is not known whether any of them contribute to the regulation of the autophagic flux. We observed no difference in binding of the phospho-mimetic SEC23B(S186D) mutant with SEC24A and SEC24B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Fig. 2K</xref>). Because the region of SEC23B that binds FBXW5 and SEC24 proteins overlaps, we investigated whether ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of SEC23B, in addition to blocking its interaction with FBXW5, affects SEC23B association with the other SEC24 paralogs. We observed that whereas both wild-type SEC23B and SEC23B(S186A) associated with all four SEC24 paralogs, SEC23B(S186D) only interacted with SEC24A and SEC24B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). Similarly, SEC24B, but not SEC24C, interacted with endogenous phosphorylated SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Accordingly, molecular dynamics simulations showed that, in contrast to what observed with SEC23B(S186D) and SEC24A, there was a significant loss in the average number of contacts between SEC23B(S186D) and SEC24C, compared to contacts observed with wild-type SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>). We also performed Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area calculations, which predicted a significantly higher value of binding free energy for the SEC23B(S186D)-SEC24C mutant dimer, resulting in the following trend: SEC23B-SEC24A &#x007E; SEC23B-SEC24C &#x2A85; SEC23B(S186D)-SEC24A &#x003C;&#x003C; SEC23B(S186D)-SEC24C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>).

<p>Altogether, these results suggest that upon serum starvation, the population of phosphorylated SEC23B preferentially associates with SEC24A and SEC24B.</p>
<p>Notably, co-depletion of both SEC24A and SEC24B, but not SEC24C and SEC24D, inhibited the increase in autophagic flux induced by the silencing of FBXW5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref>), similar to what we observed by co-depleting SEC23B together with FBXW5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We also evaluated by immunofluorescence the colocalization of SEC24 family members with ERGIC53. Upon starvation, SEC24B, but not SEC24C, colocalized more with ERGIC53 and this event was not observed in SEC23B(S186A) knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4C</xref>), suggesting that the localization of SEC24B to the ERGIC is regulated by its association with phospho-SEC23B.</p>
<p>Thus, our data demonstrate the existence of a high degree of specificity among SEC24 paralogs with respect to their ability to contribute to the autophagic flux.</p>
<p>Interestingly, by searching for mutations of SEC23B in publicly available human cancer databases, we found a mutation in melanoma that converts S186 of SEC23B to asparagine (ID&#x0023;: COSM5391641). We thus generated SEC23B(S186N), a mutant that mimics the cancer associated mutation, and observed a reduced binding to FBXW5, SEC24C, and SEC24D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>) but not to SEC24A and SEC24B, similar to what observed with SEC23B(S186D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, SEC23B(S186N) displayed a longer half-life than wild-type SEC23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4C</xref>). These results suggest that SEC23B(S186N), by being stable, may promote autophagy. To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate SEC23B(S186N) A375 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Fig. S3F</xref>). Automated quantification of endogenous LC3 showed that, compared to parental cells, the SEC23B(S186N) knock-in cells displayed more autophagy during unstressed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). The number of LC3 puncta were also increased in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>), indicating that SEC23B(S186N) increases the autophagic flux, and that the constitutive increase in LC3 puncta is not due to inhibition of the lysosome-dependent degradation of autophagosomes.</p>
<p>These results show that the SEC23B(S186N) mutation found in melanoma mimics SEC23B phosphorylated on Ser186 similarly to what observed for SEC23B(S186D). In fact, SEC23B(S186N) does not bind efficiently FBXW5, SEC24C, and SEC24D, and promotes autophagy, in agreement with a possible advantageous role resulting from increasing autophagic flux to ensure tumour cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rybstein et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>SEC23B is an essential component of the COPII multi-subunit protein complex that is responsible for the transport of cargo proteins destined to be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fromme et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zanetti et al., 2011</xref>). Although COPII vesicles were originally thought to participate exclusively in the secretory pathway, growing evidence demonstrates that they also play an important role in controlling and executing the autophagic cascade (see Introduction). However, the molecular mechanisms that repurpose COPII for the autophagic process have remained largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that FBXW5 targets SEC23B for degradation to limit autophagy during basal, unperturbed conditions. Upon induction of autophagy by nutrient deprivation, ULK1 phosphorylates Ser186 in SEC23B, inhibiting its interaction with and degradation via FBXW5. The resulting increased levels of SEC23B appear to be crucial for proper autophagic flux. We also found that phosphorylation of Ser186 in SEC23B inhibits its binding to SEC24C and SEC24D, but not SEC24A and SEC24B. Accordingly, depletion of SEC24A and SEC24B, but not SEC24C and SEC24D rescue the phenotype (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the increase in autophagy during non-stressed conditions) induced by FBXW5 silencing. The phosphorylation of Ser186 inhibits the binding of SEC23B to SEC24C and SEC24D, and this may explain, at least in part, the reduced secretion observed upon nutrient starvation.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that autophagic COPII vesicles can be distinguished from trafficking COPII vesicles by their different site of generation, <italic>i.e.,</italic> autophagic COPII vesicles are generated from the ERGIC rather than the ER, and they are potent stimulators of LC3 lipidation in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). PI3KC3, which is activated by ULK1, is required for the relocation of COPII components to the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). However, the differential molecular composition between trafficking COPII vesicles and autophagic COPII vesicles remain largely unknown. PI3KC3, which is activated by ULK1, is required for the relocation of COPII to the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). Our results indicate that autophagic COPII vesicles present at the ERGIC upon starvation contain preferentially SEC23B phosphorylated on Ser186 by ULK1. Moreover, we show that SEC24B, but not SEC24C, colocalizes more abundantly with the ERGIC and this event depends by the presence of Ser186 in SEC23B. Interestingly, in yeast, phosphorylation of Sec24 by casein kinase 1 promotes its binding to autophagy factors to increase autophagosome abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Davis et al., 2016</xref>), which is reminiscent of what we found in human cells (<italic>i.e.</italic>, phosphorylation of SEC23B by ULK1 induces the localization of SEC23B and, consequently, SEC24A and SEC24B to the ERGIC to promote the autophagic flux).</p>
<p>Recently, it has been shown that, in presence of nutrients, the basal activity of ULK1 mediates the phosphorylation of SEC16A (promoting the assembly of COPII complexes at the ERES) and that, in response to starvation, the activation of ULK1 induces the dissociation of SEC23A from SEC31A (inhibiting the secretory pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Joo et al., 2016</xref>). Our study shows that, in the absence of nutrients, activated ULK1 promotes the phosphorylation of SEC23B on Ser186 promoting the formation of autophagic COPII vesicles.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results provide evidence for the molecular mechanism by which ULK1 functions as a switch necessary to commit COPII to autophagy in response to starvation (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Fig. S4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Computational Methods</title>
<p>The SEC24A and SEC24C monomers were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (entries 3EGD and 3EH2, respectively), while SEC23B was modeled by homology from the PDB structure of SEC23A (entry 5KYN), including the missing residues from the crystal structure. The structure of the mutant SEC23B(S186D) was obtained using PyMol Mutagenesis Wizard tool (Edn. Version 1.7. Schrodinger, LLC, 2013). MD simulations were performed with the GROMACS v5.1 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>) using the Amber99SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hornak et al., 2006</xref>); the starting conformation for each dimer was modeled from the structure of the SEC23A-SEC24A dimer (PDB 3EGD). Only residues 120 to 405 from SEC23B, 502 to 742 from SEC24, and 173 to 419 from SEC24C were used in the simulations, as these are the domains involved in the dimer interaction, and we have seen that their structures were not influenced by the rest of the protein (data not shown). The systems were solvated with the SPCE water model in a triclinic box, extending at least 10 &#x00C5; from every atom of the protein, and neutralized adding sufficient Na and Cl counter ions to reach 0.15 M concentration. Bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm allowing a 2fs time-step. Long-range electrostatics interactions were taken into account using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) approach. The non-bonded cut-off for Coulomb and Van der Waals interactions were both 10 &#x00C5;, and the non-bonded pair list was updated every 25 fs. Energy minimization was conducted through the steepest-descent algorithm, until the maximum force decayed to 1000 [kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> nm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>]. The equilibration stage of the whole system consisted in 500 ps of NVT simulation followed by 500 ps of NPT simulation. Temperature was kept constant at 310 K using a modified Berendsen thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>) with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. Constant pressure of 1 bar was applied in all directions with a coupling constant of 2.0 ps and a compressibility of 4.5 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup> bar<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Finally, the equilibrated systems were subjected to a 1 &#x03BC;s MD simulation run each at 310 K. Binding free energies were calculated using de MM-GBSA scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Genheden and Ryde, 2015</xref>) provided in the Amber16 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Case et al., 2017</xref>) using the single trajectory approach. Hundred snapshots were collected at time intervals of 5 ns from the last 500 ns of the MD simulations, thus guaranteeing statistical independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anisimov and Cavasotto, 2011</xref>).

<title>CRISPR genome editing</title>
<p>To generate SEC23B S186A and S186N knock-in cells, an optimal gRNA target sequence closest to the genomic target site and a 2.1 kb homologous recombination (HR) donor template were designed using the Benchling CRISPR Genome Engineering tool. The HR donor template was designed to introduce alanine or asparagine substitutions at position S186, and a silent mutation to introduce a KpnI restriction site for genotyping. SEC23B gRNA target sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure S3F</xref>) was cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458), a gift from F. Zhang (Addgene plasmid no. 48138) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ge et al., 2013</xref>). A375 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes at approximately 70&#x0025; confluency and transfected with 2.5 &#x03BC;g each of gRNA-containing PX458 plasmid and HR donor template, using lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). The transfection was performed according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommended protocol, using a 2:1 ratio of lipofectamine:DNA. Two days after transfection, GFP-positive cells were sorted using the Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP cell sorter (100 &#x03BC;m nozzle), and 5,000 cells were plated on a 15-cm dish. About a week later, single-cell clones were picked, trypsinized in 0.25&#x0025; Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min, and plated into individual wells of a 96-well plate for genotyping. Genomic DNA was collected using QuickExtract (Epicentre). Genotyping PCRs were performed with MyTaq&#x2122; HS Red Mix (Bioline), using primers surrounding the genomic target sites.

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Images were analyzed with an in-house developed python script. Cell counts were calculated by detecting nuclei labeled by DAPI in the blue channel of the image. First, a Gaussian smoothing was applied, and then an Otsu threshold to determine the nuclei mask. This was followed by watershed segmentation to separate touching nuclei, as well as filtering based on area to remove small spots. Partial nuclei touching image borders were included but were counted as a fraction based on the average nuclei size measured in the data set. The puncta (green channel) were detected using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) blob detection algorithm as provided by the python package &#x201C;scikit-image&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). Any blobs found in the regions covered by cell nuclei were ignored. The puncta area was calculated by finding the area of a circle with radius proportional to the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel that detected the blob, as returned by the LoG algorithm. Prior to applying LoG, some images required a median filter for removal of speckle noise. Some very bright cells were removed from the analysis (identified nuclei and a surrounding area), since it was not possible to distinguish puncta in these areas. These cells were identified by finding outliers from the set of nuclei mean intensities of the image. All statistical analysis was performed with unpaired Student&#x2019;s t test, and it is considered significant when the p value is less than 0.05. n.s., not significant. Data were expressed as mean &#x00B1; SD of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.</p>

<p>(A) RPE1-hTERT cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were transfected with either a nontargeting siRNA oligo (NT) or an siRNA oligo targeting FBXW5 RNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were replated onto coverglass (left panel). Where indicated, cells were treated with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) for 4h before fixation with cold methanol. Images of the GFP-LC3 puncta underwent automated processing with at least 300 cells counted per sample. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SD (right panel). Scale bar, 10 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>(B) RPE1-hTERT cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were transfected with either a non-targeting siRNA oligo (NT) or an siRNA oligo targeting FBXW5 RNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were replated onto coverglass for immunofluorescence with an anti-LC3 antibody (left panel). Cells were nutrient-starved with EBSS for 4 hours before fixation with cold methanol. Images of the LC3 puncta underwent automated processing with at least 300 cells counted per sample. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SD (right panel). Scale bar, 10 &#x03BC;m.</p>
<p>(C) HeLa cells were permeabilized, incubated with either purified recombinant FLAG-tagged SEC23B or purified recombinant FLAG-tagged SEC23B(S186D), and subjected to subcellular fractionation. Each fraction was subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. ERGIC53 was used as a marker of the ERGIC, and RIBOPHORIN-1 as a marker of the ER. SEC23B bands were subjected to densitometry analysis and quantified as percentage of total SEC23B or SEC23B(S186D).</p>
<p>(D) HEK239T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Gaussia luciferase in combination with the indicated constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were replated onto 96-well plates. After another forty-eight hours, fresh media was added to the cells, and four hours after, the culture media were collected to measure Gaussia luciferase activity. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SD of the Gaussia luciferase activity of triplicate samples. Expression of FBXW5 was used as a positive control since it results in the downregulation of SEC23B and, therefore, it is expected to inhibit trafficking.</p>
<p>(E) A375 cells stably expressing Gaussia luciferase were plated onto 96-well plates. After forty-eight hours, either fresh media or EBSS was added to the cells and four hours after, the culture media were collected to measure Gaussia luciferase activity. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SD of the Gaussia luciferase activity of triplicate samples.</p>
<p>(F) Schematic representation of the SEC23B genomic locus and gRNA target location. Exon 5 refers to human SEC23B gene (Gene ID: 10483). Wild-type genomic DNA template and knock-in mutant sequences are shown for both SEC23B(S186A) and SEC23B(S186N).</p></caption>

<p>(A) Evolution of the inter-molecular contacts between monomers in the four studied systems during 1 &#x03BC;s molecular dynamics simulations. Left panel: SEC23B-SEC24C (red), SEC23B(S186D)-SEC24C (violet); right panel: SEC23B-SEC24A (red), SEC23B(S186D)-SEC24A (violet). Contacts were calculated as the number of heavy atom interacting pairs within a distance of 4.4&#x00C5;.</p>
<p>(B) RPE1-hTERT cells were transfected with either a non-targeting oligo (NT) or the siRNA oligos to the indicated mRNAs. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for immunoblotting as indicated.</p>
<p>(C) A375 parental cells or SEC23B(S186D)-A357 knock-in cells were transfected with either HA-tagged SEC24B or HA-tagged SEC24C. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were either left untreated (UT) or starved with EBSS for two hours. Next, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence as indicated (upper panel). Images were analysed by ImageJ with at least 100 cells counted per sample. Quantification of SEC24 overlapped with ERGIC53 was performed using the Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SD (bottom panel). Scale bar, 10 &#x03BC;M.</p>
<p>(D) HEK293T cells were transfected with either Streptag-FLAG-tagged (SF) wild-type SEC23B (SF-SEC23B) or Streptag-FLAG-tagged (SF) SEC23B(S186N). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated time and subjected to immunoblot analysis.</p>
<p>(E) Model of how ULK1 and FBXW5 modulate SEC23B-mediated autophagy. See text for details. The SEC23B degron is shown as a red line in SEC23B.</p></caption>
