<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>All vertebrates share a segmented body axis. Segments form periodically from the rostral end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and this periodicity is regulated by the segmentation clock, a molecular oscillator that drives dynamic clock gene expression across the PSM with a periodicity that matches somite formation. Notch signalling is crucial to this process. Altering Notch intracellular domain (NICD) stability affects both the clock period and somite size. However, the mechanistic details of how NICD stability is regulated are unclear.</p>
<p>We identified a highly conserved site crucial for NICD recognition by the SCF E3 ligase, which targets NICD for degradation. We demonstrate both CDK1 and CDK2 can phosphorylate NICD in the domain where this crucial residue lies and that NICD levels vary in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Inhibiting CDK1 or CDK2 activity increases NICD levels both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to a delay of clock gene oscillations.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Segmentation, a process which occurs early during vertebrate body plan formation, generates repeated segments (or somites) that later give rise to the vertebral column, most skeletal musculature and dermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>During somitogenesis, pairs of somites bud off the rostral end of the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm (PSM) with a periodicity that is species specific. The periodicity of segment formation is regulated by a molecular oscillator, known as the somitogenesis clock, which drives oscillatory gene expression within the PSM tissue from which somites are derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>These clock genes are targets of the Notch, Wnt and FGF pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Aberrant somitogenesis leads to severe segmentation and skeletal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In humans, defects in segmentation lead to congenital scoliosis (CS), with an infant mortality rate of 50&#x0025; that comprises many vertebral skeletal and muscular pathologies, including the family of spondylocostal dysostoses (SCD). For CS, whilst the aetiology is unclear, linkage analyses have shown mutations in four genes lead to familial forms of SCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Significantly these are components of the Notch pathway, which plays multiple roles during segmentation. Notch is crucial to the segmentation process in mice, since in the absence of Notch signalling, the segmentation clock stops and no somites form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>On a single cell level in the PSM, oscillatory clock gene expression is established through positive and negative feedback loops of unstable clock gene products which potentiate or inhibit the pathway that activates them. Synchronisation of clock gene oscillations between neighbouring cells is reliant on Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Mathematical models predict the period of clock gene oscillations can be approximated as a sum of the delays involved in transcription, splicing, translation and transport of clock gene products, and in particular through the regulation of the half-lives of both mRNA and protein of unstable regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Whilst great progress has been made in demonstrating the role of transcription and splicing delays in setting the clock period, little experimental work investigating whether stability of clock components affects clock period has been performed.</p>
<p>Most studies addressing the molecular mechanisms regulating the periodicity of clock gene oscillations have focused on the role of Notch signalling components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] Notch is one of the major highly conserved signalling pathways that regulate cell-cell communication which involves gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple processes during development and adult life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Upon extracellular ligand activation, Notch transmembrane receptors are cleaved, releasing the intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to the nucleus to regulate expression of specific developmental gene cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. NICD is highly labile, and phosphorylation-dependent turnover acts to restrict Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>
<p>All known canonical Notch activity relies on this regulation of NICD half-life. Moreover, aberrant NICD turnover contributes to numerous cancers and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Despite the multiple impacts of NICD turnover in both development and disease, the molecular details regulating this turnover remain uncharacterised. The stability of NICD and therefore duration of the Notch signal is regulated by phosphorylation of the C-Terminal PEST domain which leads to subsequent recruitment of FBXW7, F-Box and WD Repeat Domain Containing 7, (a key component of the SCF<sup>Sel10/FBXW7</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Ultimately, this leads NICD to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. However, the molecular details of NICD degradation mediated by FBXW7 are not well understood.</p>
<p>A recent study combining experimental and computational biology demonstrated changes in NICD stability affect the chick and mouse somitogenesis clock period which in turn affects somite size. In this study a pharmacological approach was used to demonstrate that culturing chick/mouse PSM explants with broad specificity inhibitors of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Roscovitine/DRB) and Wnt signalling (XAV939) leads to elevated levels and a prolonged NICD half-life and phase shifted clock oscillation patterns both at a tissue level and in larger segments. Furthermore, reducing NICD production in this assay rescues these effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These results imply potential coupling between NICD degradation and the segmentation clock. However, the specific kinases/molecular mechanism of action remain ill-defined and leave open the question of whether this coupling is a general or conserved mechanism.</p>
<p>In this manuscript we identify the phosphorylated residues within human NICD. We demonstrate that purified recombinant Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylate NICD within the PEST domain. A point mutation affecting a conserved serine residue within this CDK substrate domain of the NICD PEST motif prevents NICD interaction with endogenous FBXW7. Strikingly, we show that NICD levels fluctuate in a cell cycle dependent manner anti-correlating with high levels of CDK1/2 activity. Lastly, highly specific inhibitors of CDK1 or CDK2 lead to increased levels of NICD <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in viv</italic>o and delay the mouse somitogenesis clock and somite formation.</p>
<p>Using a mathematical model we show that the experimental observations made in cell lines and PSM tissue can be explained in a single theoretical framework that couples the cell cycle to NICD degradation.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939 increase NICD levels in HEK293, iPS and IMR90 cells</title>
<p>Direct phosphorylation of NICD in its PEST domain enhances its turnover and thus degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. A study using broad range kinase inhibitors demonstrated that the stability and turnover of NICD is linked to the regulation of the pace of the segmentation clock across the PSM in chick and mice embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, this study did not define the specific kinases or molecular mechanism of action of the inhibitors. In order to identify which kinases are involved in NICD phosphorylation and which residues in the NICD PEST domain are phosphorylated rendering NICD susceptible to degradation, we employed a cellular model due to the limiting quantity of material available using embryonic cell lysates.</p>
<p>First, we used the same inhibitors as Wiedermann <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and thus investigated if Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939 elicit the same effect upon NICD levels in a variety of cell culture models, namely HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), iPS (induced pluripotent stem cells) and IMR90 (human Caucasian foetal lung fibroblast) cells.</p>
<p>Roscovitine is a small molecule belonging to the family of purines. It inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) through direct competition with ATP for binding at the ATP-binding site of CDKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-&#x03B2;-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) also inhibits CDKs, particularly CDK7 and 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. XAV939 is a Wnt inhibitor that stimulates &#x03B2;-catenin degradation by stabilizing axin through inhibition of the enzymes tankyrase 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. HEK293, iPS or IMR90 cells treated for 3 hours with each of the three inhibitors at the same concentrations used in embryonic lysate studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] led to an increase in NICD levels compared to control cells cultured in the presence of DMSO (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>). In control conditions, NICD was not easily detectable due to its very short half-life. Quantification of the density of western blot bands in at least three independent experiments confirmed that the increase in NICD levels was statistically significant after treatment with Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref></bold>. Two other inhibitors were used as positive and negative controls for the assay. LY411575 is a &#x03B3;-secretase inhibitor that prevents Notch1 cleavage and thus inhibits activation of target gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. As expected, LY411575 treatment significantly reduced NICD levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>). Phosphorylation of the C-Terminal PEST domain of NICD leads to recruitment of FBXW7 and thus to NICD ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. When E3 ligase activity is reduced with the NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], NICD levels increase, since NICD degradation is stopped in the presence of this compound (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Endogenous NICD levels increase in HEK293 cells following treatment with Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939.</title>
<p>(A) HEK293 cells were treated for 3 hours with 150 nM of LY411575, 1 &#x03BC;M of MLN4924, 10 &#x03BC;M of Roscovitine, 10 &#x03BC;M DRB or 10 &#x03BC;M XAV939. DMSO served as vehicle control. Transfection with pCS2-NICD vector served as positive control. Western blot analysis reveals that NICD levels were increased upon treatment with Roscovitine, DRB, XAV939, or MLN4924. NICD is undetectable following LY411575 treatment. NICD antibody detects a doublet following inhibitor treatment and the top band disappears following &#x03BB; phosphatase treatment indicating that this top band is a phosphorylated isoform. &#x03B2;-Actin served as loading control.</p>

All data represent the mean &#x00B1; SEM from three independent experiments. Student&#x2019;s t-test analysis was performed with &#x002A;p&#x2264;0.05, &#x002A;&#x002A;p&#x2264;0.01, &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;p&#x2264;0.001.</p>
<p>(C) iPS cells were treated for 3 hours with 150 nM of LY411575, 1 &#x03BC;M of MLN4924, 10 &#x03BC;M of Roscovitine, 10 &#x03BC;M DRB or 10 &#x03BC;M XAV939. DMSO has been used as vehicle control. Western blot analysis reveals that NICD levels were increased upon treatment with Roscovitine, DRB, XAV939, or MLN4924. NICD is undetectable following LY411575 treatment. NICD antibody detects a doublet following Inhibitor treatment and the top band disappears following &#x03BB; phosphatase treatment indicative that this top band is a phosphorylated isoform. &#x03B2;-Actin served as loading control.</p>

<p>(E) HEK293 cells were treated with the same inhibitors as described in (A). NICD phosphorylation status was analysed by a Phos-tag assay. DMSO served as vehicle control. NICD phosphorylation profile varies following Roscovitine, DRB, XAV939 or MLN4924 treatment. Following &#x03BB; phosphatase treatment none of the high molecular weight bands are visible indicating they are all phosphorylated isoforms.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, we were able to detect two distinct bands by western blot with the NICD antibody, particularly when cells were treated with MLN4924. We hypothesised this reflected the presence of non-phospho and phospho-NICD species. To test this hypothesis, we treated MLN4924-treated lysates with &#x03BB; phosphatase which abrogated the appearance of the higher band by western blot with the NICD antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref></bold>). These data demonstrate that the higher band detected corresponds to a phosphorylated isoform of NICD.</p>
<p>In order to determine if the increased levels of NICD were due to increased NICD production and/or increased NICD stability, we exposed HEK293 cells to LY411575 treatment for the last hour of culture, thereby inhibiting the production of new NICD. Under control conditions with LY411575 treatment in the last hour, NICD levels are very low (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, lane 2</bold>). However, despite LY411575 treatment in the last hour, cells cultured in the presence of small molecule inhibitors showed increased levels of NICD compared to the control, indicating that the increase in NICD levels is not due to increased NICD production, but to an increased stability (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results show that exposure to this group of inhibitors leads to increased levels of NICD in a variety of cell lines, in the same way that they do in the mouse and chicken PSM tissue, suggesting they regulate a conserved mechanism leading to increased NICD levels and reduced NICD turnover.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Phostag analysis following Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939 treatment reveals a variety of NICD phospho-species</title>
<p>In order to investigate whether this selection of small molecule inhibitors have different effects on NICD phosphorylation, we treated HEK293 cells with the inhibitors and performed a Phostag assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Following MLN4924 treatment, a variety of bands indicative of different phospho-species of NICD was observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). Given that very few bands are present in the control sample (DMSO, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), the bands detected after MLN4924 treatment are likely to be very labile isoforms of the NICD peptide, which are rapidly degraded in the DMSO sample. In contrast, when whole cell lysate was treated with both MLN4924 and &#x03BB; phosphatase only one band, of the lowest molecular weight, was detectable, further supporting the notion that the ladder of bands obtained upon MLN4924 treatment reflects a variety of unstable phosphorylated NICD isoforms, which is completely depleted in the presence of &#x03BB; phosphatase (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). As expected from data showing NICD levels are increased after inhibitor treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A-D</xref></bold>), all three kinase inhibitors Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939 cause a noticeable increase in the number and intensity of bands compared to control cells. However, compared to the effect seen with MLN4924, phos-tag technology reveals Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939 have a reduced number of phospho-bands as compared to MLN4924, indicative of the fact these kinase inhibitors act to reduce NICD phosphorylation. Moreover, each of the inhibitors presents a distinct profile of NICD phospho-species. These data suggest that NICD is targeted by several kinases and/or phosphorylation events which are differentially sensitive to these inhibitors (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>NICD-FBXW7 interact at the endogenous levels in HEK293 cells, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The involvement of the F-box protein component of the SCF E3 ligase complex, FBXW7, in NICD degradation has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. However, to date, the NICD-FBXW7 interaction has only been shown in overexpressed systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] Thus, we examined the binding of NICD to FBXW7 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis at the endogenous level.</p>
<p>FBXW7 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells treated with DMSO or MLN4924 for 3 hours and extracts were probed with NICD antibody. NICD directly binds to FBXW7 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). After MLN4924 treatment, the amount of NICD bound to FBXW7 was significantly higher compared to control cells and this was particularly evident with the higher molecular weight isoform of NICD (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A-B</xref></bold>), confirming again NICD-FBXW7 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent.</p>

<p>In order to determine if the change in the NICD phosphorylation profile observed after treatment with the CDK inhibitors reduced the NICD-FBXW7 interaction, we performed the same co-immunoprecipitation assay after CDK inhibitor treatment. In order to maximise the amount of NICD immunoprecipitated with FBXW7, cells were treated with MLN4924 (to prevent NICD degradation) in the presence or absence of the CDK inhibitors. A significantly reduced interaction between NICD and FBXW7 was observed after treating HEK293 cells with Roscovitine or DRB for 3 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref></bold>). Statistical analyses, carried out on the density of western blot bands after immunoprecipitation, confirmed a significant reduction in the interaction between NICD and FBXW7 following either Roscovitine or DRB treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data demonstrate, for the first time, that NICD interacts with FBXW7 at endogenous levels in HEK293 cells, and this interaction is dependent on phosphorylation. To further validate the involvement of FBXW7 in endogenous NICD turnover, we conducted a siRNA-mediated depletion of FBXW7 in HEK293 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref></bold>). siRNA treatment efficiently depleted FBXW7 protein levels and led to an increase in levels of the FBXW7 target protein Cyclin E. FBXW7 depletion also resulted in increased levels of NICD, and, in particular, an accumulation of the phosphorylated form of NICD (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Serine 2513 is essential for the NICD-FBXW7 interaction</title>
<p>We utilised Mass Spectrometry as an unbiased approach to identify which NICD residues are phosphorylated in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with human NICD-GFP, followed by immunoprecipitation of NICD-GFP. Gel slices were processed and submitted to MS analysis. We identified 15 phospho-sites on exogenous hNICD, highlighted in green in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>. To investigate the relevance of those phosphorylation sites in NICD turnover, we screened those located within the PEST domain (such as S2527), and others based on the FBXW7 phosphodegron motif (such as S2205, S2513, S2516, S2538) which is known to be [RK] S/T P [RK] X S/T/E/D, where X is any amino acid and RK is any amino acid except arginine (R) or lysine (K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>].</p>

The exogenously expressed protein was subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and precipitated material was analysed by western blot using FBXW7 antibody. Wild-type hNICDGFP and GFP only vectors were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. Western blot using GFP antibody served as immunoprecipitation efficiency control. &#x03B2;-Actin has been used as loading control for the input lanes.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Thus, we generated 5 peptides each carrying a serine to alanine point mutation in an identified site. Following transient transfection of HEK293 cells with wild-type or mutated peptides we performed immunoprecipitation using GFP-conjugated beads, to evaluate peptide binding efficiency with endogenous FBXW7.</p>
<p>In 2004, Fryer and colleagues proposed that CDK8 phosphorylates serine residues 2481, 2484, 2506 (2513, 2516, 2538 in our annotation). They reported that when all of these residues were mutated from serine to alanine, <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation by recombinant CyClinC:CDK8 was dramatically reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], suggesting these sites could be implicated in NICD stability. However, we find individual mutations on serine residues 2205, 2516, 2527 and 2538 did not affect the NICD-FBXW7 interaction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). However, mutating serine 2513 to alanine, to render this residue non-phosphorylatable, completely abolished the NICD-FBXW7 interaction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Cells transfected with the double mutant S2513A/S2516A also showed a dramatic loss of the NICD-FBXW7 interaction. This did not reflect a reduction in the level of immunoprecipitated GFP (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Thus, our data suggest that only serine 2513, of those we have tested, is the key NICD phosphorylation site required for interaction with FBXW7, and thus potentially crucial for NICD stability and turnover.</p>

Of seven kinases tested, 5 had no specific activity against any of the peptides. In contrast, CDK1 and CDK2 elicited a very high activity against Peptide 1, which contained serine residues 2513 and 2516, previously identified by Mass spectrometry analysis to be phosphorylated in NICD and in particular 2513 we have shown to be crucial for the NICD-FBXW7 interaction.</p>

<title>NICD levels fluctuate over the cell cycle</title>
<p>It is well known that CDK1 and CDK2 share several substrates, with a consequent functional redundancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that these two kinases can phosphorylate NICD <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the absence of either kinase NICD levels increase in HEK293 cells suggesting they are not acting redundantly in this context. In order to further test this, we analysed whether NICD levels fluctuate during the cell cycle where the role of both CDK1 and CDK2 has been extensively reported in regulating transition to distinct cell cycle phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>].</p>
<p>To that end, we synchronised HEK293 cells by using a double thymidine block assay. After releasing from the second thymidine block, cells were collected at indicated time points and cell cycle characterization was performed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold> shows the distribution though the cell cycle of HEK293 cells after synchronization at early S-Phase (0 hour), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Two and four hours post release, the majority of cells were in S-phase. At six hours post release, the majority of cells were in G2 phase, while eight hours after release, the majority of cells were in late G2/early M phase. At ten hours post release, the majority of cells had exited mitotic phase and already entered G1. After twelve hours from release, cells were in mid/late G1 of the new cell cycle (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). The graph in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref></bold> represents the cell cycle distribution of HEK293 cells at distinct time points post double thymidine block and release from three independent experiments analysed by FACS. Western blotting analysis of synchronized HEK293 cell extracts showed the expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins at the same distinct time points reflecting distinct cell cycle phases as described above (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we found that NICD levels fluctuated in a striking manner during the cell cycle, whereas we saw no change to levels of FBXW7. At 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours post release, we observed a dramatic decrease of NICD expression corresponding to CDK2-dependent G1/S phase, whereas the decrease 8 hours after double thymidine block release occurred in the CDK1-dependent G2/M phase transition. These data suggest that NICD levels fluctuate during the cell cycle in a CDK1 and CDK2-dependent manner.</p>

To further explore whether clock gene oscillations were delayed following CDK2 inhibition, we used the half-embryo assay, where the PSM from one half of an E10.5 mouse embryo is cultured in control media, while the contralateral half from the same embryo is cultured in the presence of 1&#x03BC;M of Purvalanol B for 4 hours. In 55.5&#x0025; of cases examined (n=10/18), exposure of PSM explants to Purvalanol B caused a delay in the pace of oscillatory <italic>mLfng</italic> expression across the PSM as compared to the control explant (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Also, in some cases the treated explant (&#x201C;&#x002B;&#x201D;) developed one somite less compared to the control (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we cultured E10.5 mouse PSM explants in the presence or absence of the CDK1 inhibitor, RO-3306, for 4 hours at 10&#x03BC;M. Analysis of NICD levels by western blot revealed that inhibition of CDK1 leads to elevated levels of NICD compared to control embryos (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). E10.5 mouse half embryo explants exposed to RO-3306 treatment for 4 hours showed delayed clock oscillations of <italic>mLfng</italic> as compared to DMSO treated contralateral half embryo explants (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref></bold>). These data, not only support our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, but importantly provide, for the first time, the <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that CDK1 and CDK2 are involved in NICD stability and turnover and that this molecular regulation of NICD turnover is extricably linked to the pace of the segmentation clock.</p>

<title>Mathematical model links NICD regulation and cell cycle</title>
<p>To understand how our findings on the molecular details of NICD regulation in individual cells give rise to tissue-scale delay of the segmentation clock, we first developed a mathematical model of NICD production and degradation in HEK293 cells. The variables in the model define the position of a cell in the cell cycle, the amount of NICD and the amount of phosphorylated NICD (pNICD) at time <italic>t</italic>. The model enables us to connect assumptions about molecular processes in individual cells with experiments performed on a large population of cells.</p>
<p>We assume a <italic>K</italic>-compartment model that describes sequential progression of a cell through the cell cycle (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref></bold>). It is assumed that CDKs that phosphorylate NICD, resulting in its interaction with FBXW7 and subsequent degradation, are active in some <italic>m</italic> of the cell cycle states. We assume that: (i) NICD exists in non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms; (ii) NICD is produced at constant rate <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>; (iii) both forms of NICD get degraded at background rate <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub>; (iv) NICD gets phosphorylated by CDKs at rate <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>; (v) pNICD degrades at rate <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub> with <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub> &#x003E; <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub>; and (vi) dephosphorylation of NICD occurs at rate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>. We consider the pharmacological perturbations as follows: LY411575 treatment experiments, in which NICD production is inhibited, are simulated by setting <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0; Purvalanol B/Roscovitine treatment experiments, which target only CDK2, reduce the number of compartments where CDKs are active by a factor of two; and MLN4924 treatment, which inhibits FBXW7 mediated degradation of NICD, are simulated by removing the fast mode of decay (<italic>k<sub>6</sub></italic> = 0).</p>

<p>By averaging cellular descriptions of NICD and the cell cycle over a given cell population, we derive equations describing the average levels of total NICD (i.e. as measured in a Western Blot experiment, see Methods). Upon release from double thymidine block, cells are synchronised in the cell cycle and there are relatively high levels of CDK activity at different times post release. As pNICD degrades faster, high levels of CDK results in lower levels of NICD (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A-D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C-E</xref></bold>). We find the model qualitatively fits the experimental observations if NICD is phosphorylated in two separate time windows post release. We propose that these windows correspond to activity of CDK2 (G1/S phase) and CDK1 (M phase) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref></bold>). In a situation where the cell cycle is desynchronised, the population-averaged phosphorylation rate (<italic>mk</italic><sub>3</sub>/<italic>K</italic>, where <italic>m</italic>/<italic>K</italic> is the fraction of the cell cycle where CDKs are active) is a fraction of the true phosphorylation rate. The model can reproduce Western Blot results from DMSO and MLN4924 experiments (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref></bold>), allowing inference of the parameters <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>. Notably, the simulated Purvalanol B/Roscovitine treatment experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> is a prediction that is validated by the experimental data.</p>
<p>To explore how CDK inhibition results in delay of the segmentation clock we introduce an additional variable representing phase of the somitogenesis clock and assume that the caudal PSM behaves like a population of phase coupled oscillators. In Wiederman et al. we proposed a model that showed how competition between activators and inhibitors of clock gene transcription could lead to the oscillator period being an increasing function of NICD half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Here, we impose, without explicitly describing the molecular circuitry, this assumption. We assume that each cellular oscillator has a natural frequency <italic>&#x03C9;<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic> that is a function of cell cycle position; when CDKs are active the baseline clock frequency, <italic>&#x03C9;<sub>0</sub></italic>, is increased by an acceleration factor <italic>r</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref></bold>). As the cell cycle is asynchronous in the PSM, it is therefore comprised of a population of oscillators with frequencies <italic>&#x03C9;</italic><sub>0</sub> or <italic>&#x03C9;r</italic><sub>0</sub>. Given sufficiently strong coupling a population of such oscillators yields synchronous oscillations with a period that is an average of the individual oscillator periods (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8E-8F</xref></bold>). Upon CDK inhibition, the relative number of faster oscillators is reduced hence the average period decreases (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref></bold>). Hence the cell cycle somitogenesis coupled model provide a mechanistic description of how CDK-mediated phosphorylation of NICD can result in the observed phenotype in PSM tissue (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The Notch pathway plays multiple critical roles in somitogenesis. Notch signalling is critical for dynamic clock gene expression and for somite formation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Notch-Delta signalling is essential to synchronise clock gene oscillations among neighbouring cells of the PSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Moreover, a recent publication using a pharmacological approach, has shown that modulating the half-life of NICD affects the clock oscillation period and somite size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. It is important to note that NICD degradation and turnover still occurred under these conditions but less efficiently. In this study, we have significantly extended those findings to determine the mechanistic details of regulation of NICD turnover, and we report for the first time that cell cycle-dependent CDK1 and CDK2 activity is involved in NICD turnover, which has broad implications across all developmental and disease contexts where Notch plays a role.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that kinase inhibitors (Roscovitine, DRB and XAV939), previously shown to prolong NICD half-life and delay the segmentation clock pace in mouse and chick PSM <italic>in vivo</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] also increased endogenous levels of human NICD when a range of primary human cell lines were treated for 3 hours. This highlights the conserved effect of these inhibitors on regulating NICD stability, which is perhaps not surprising given the high degree of sequence similarity between mouse, human and chicken NICD.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that, following exposure to these kinase inhibitors, the increased stability of NICD accompanies a change in the array of phosphorylated isoforms of NICD observed. The different profiles of phosphorylated isoforms of NICD observed, following exposure to each of the inhibitors, suggest they each inhibit distinct kinases. In each case, however, the highest molecular bands were no longer visible. It is possible that the multiple phosphorylation bands are indicative of unique events, some of which may reflect priming phosphorylation events that facilitate or increase the efficiency of secondary phosphorylation events, which then act as phospho-degron signals to recruit E3 ligases that target NICD for degradation. It is not possible to determine whether the lower molecular weight bands that remain, following inhibitor treatment, are indicative of the loss of primary or secondary phosphorylation events.</p>
<p>A number of reports have highlighted the fact that the SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup> E3 ligase plays an important role in NICD degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. SCFs (Skp1, Cullin-1, F-box protein) are a class of E3 ligases that use Cullin-1 as a scaffold and F-box proteins as substrate receptors. FBXW7 is an evolutionary conserved F-box protein. Substrate phosphorylation instigates FBXW7 binding to a conserved CDC4 phospho-degron motif which then recruits the rest of the E3 ligase complex, including Cullin1, thereby targeting the substrate for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. The role of FBXW7 in NICD regulation is also supported by data showing that, when mammalian Sel-10 (homologue of FBXW7 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) is mutated, NICD is much more stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. To date, the interaction between NICD and FBXW7 by co-immunoprecipitation has only been shown using overexpressed proteins, due to the fact this interaction is very transient and leads to efficient degradation of NICD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. In order to stabilise the interacting complex, we conducted experiments in the presence of MLN4924, a Cullin1 neddylation inhibitor which prevents activation of Cullin1. Under these conditions, we demonstrate for the first time that NICD and FBXW7 can interact at endogenous levels in HEK293 cells. Moreover, this allowed us to demonstrate that, when phosphorylation is disrupted by small molecule CDK inhibitors (Roscovitine or DRB), the NICD-FBXW7 interaction is reduced. It is important to note that neither inhibitor abolished the NICD-FBXW7 interaction which suggests again that they are each inhibiting only some of the kinase activity involved in NICD phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of FBXW7. This aligns with the observation that in the chick/mouse PSM both of these inhibitors increase NICD stability and the period of the segmentation clock but that NICD turnover still occurs in this tissue, and thus is dependent on a number of different kinases/phosphorylation events differentially targeted by these two inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>By Mass Spectrometry analysis, we identified 15 phospho-sites within human exogenous NICD in HEK293 cells, some of which have been previously identified and reported to be involved with NICD turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Among those phospho-sites identified, we found that Serine 2513, when mutated to alanine, thereby rendering the site non phosphorylatable, was essential for the interaction between NICD and FBXW7. Point mutations in a number of other phosphorylated residues showed these are non-essential for this NICD-FBXW7 interaction, including two residues that have previously been reported to potentially be required for the interaction; S2484 and S2506 (S2516 and S2538 in our annotation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. However, Fryer and colleagues used exogenous proteins and mutated all three sites simultaneously so the individual contribution/requirement of each residue was not addressed in that study. O&#x2019;Neil and colleagues have also reported, using exogenous proteins, that phosphorylation of the Threonine residue at T2487 in mouse NICD (T2511 in our annotation) is key to driving the NICD-FBXW7 interaction and subsequent ubiquitination of NICD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. We did not observe phosphorylation at this residue in human NICD. However it would be interesting to repeat the mass spec analysis using different enzyme digestions to determine if this reveals additional phosphorylated sites that play a role in this interaction.</p>
<p>SCF substrates typically have many phospho-degrons that can be widely dispersed. It will be important to test the requirement of all the phosphorylated residues we have identified in NICD for driving and regulating the NICD-FBXW7 interaction.</p>
<p>We have identified CDK1 and CDK2 as two kinases that can phosphorylate NICD in the PEST region that harbours residue serine 2513, which we have demonstrated to be crucial for the interaction between NICD and FBXW7. Through two loss of function approaches, namely siRNA and a pharmacological approach, we further demonstrated the role of both CDK1 and CDK2 kinases in the regulation of NICD turnover. Indeed, by transfecting HEK293 cells with CDK1, or CDK2 specific siRNA, or treating HEK293 cells or iPS cells with highly selective small molecule inhibitors against CDK1 and CDK2, we could appreciate an increase in NICD levels, indicating that inhibiting phosphorylation by CDK1 or CDK2, renders NICD more stable. As described above, the serine 2513 residue has previously been reported to potentially be involved in NICD turnover in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Using gain and loss of function experiments with exogenous proteins, the authors reported phosphorylation occurred through CyclinC:CDK8. Indeed, by transfecting HEK293 cells with CDK8 specific siRNA, we could also appreciate an increase in NICD levels, indicating that this kinase could also play a role in NICD turnover, although the effect appears less dramatic compared to that observed with CDK1 or CDK2 specific siRNA.</p>
<p>CDK1 and CDK2 activity and thus phosphorylation of their substrates changes in a cell cycle dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Strikingly, we find that NICD levels vary in HEK293 cells in a cell cycle-dependent way such that we observe lowest levels of NICD in phases of the cell cycle where CDK1/Cyclin B1 and CDK2/Cyclin E levels are highest and therefore when these complexes are reported to be most active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. This finding suggests that NICD activity, signal duration and signal strength is likely to vary in a cell cycle dependent manner, potentially leading to differential transcriptional output in different phases of the cell cycle.</p>
<p>Given our findings, it is striking that CDK2 homozygous <italic>null</italic> mice are viable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. However, it has been reported that CDK1 and CDK2 share more than 50&#x0025; of their targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>] which is likely to allow for a lot of redundancy in this knock-out line, as CDK1 can compensate for loss of CDK2 by forming active complexes with A-, B-, E- and D-type cyclins. The CDK1-<italic>null</italic> homozygous mice however are embryonic lethal and a CDK2 knock-in to the CDK1 locus is unable to rescue this phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. It would be interesting to examine the role of the CDK1 conditional mutant in the context of Notch signalling and somitogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Interestingly, Cyclin C-<italic>null</italic> mice, which are embryonic lethal at 10.5, show dramatically reduced NICD1 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and elevated NICD1 levels. The authors show that Cyclin C can complex with CDK3, CDK19, CDK8, CDK1 and CDK2 to phosphorylate NICD1 and promote NICD1 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Thus, it would be very interesting to examine a PSM conditional Cyclin C loss of function to determine whether this cyclin is involved in regulating NICD turnover in this tissue. It is noteworthy Cyclin C levels did not appear to vary in a cell cycle dependent manner in HEK293 cells, although it is possible the activity of Cyclin C/CDK complexes varies in a cell cycle-dependent manner through post-translational modifications rather than protein levels per se.</p>
<p>The finding that CDK1 inhibition or CDK2 inhibition leads to increased levels of NICD in E10.5 mouse embryo PSM lysates and to a delay in clock gene oscillations and somite formation provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that both CDK1 and CDK2 are involved in NICD turnover.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that inhibition of CDK2 activity with a highly selective inhibitor reduces the NICD-FBXW7 interaction in HEK293 cells but does not block it completely, as we saw with Roscovitine and DRB. Indeed, inhibition of CDK1 or CDK2 in the mouse PSM with highly selective inhibitors raises NICD levels and also slows, but does not block, dynamic Notch target clock gene expression, and somitogenesis. This suggests that some NICD turnover persists under these conditions, possibly through redundancy between CDK1 and 2 and/or through CDK8-mediated phosphorylation, the subsequent recruitment of E3 ligases and degradation of NICD. Moreover, a report by Chiang <italic>et al</italic>. has also identified a region downstream of the PEST sequence, termed S4, that is involved in NICD degradation, but that is independent of FBXW7 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. These data indicate there are several mechanisms regulating NICD turnover which are partially redundant.</p>
<p>We also developed a mathematical model that coupled cell cycle dynamics to NICD degradation. Using HEK293 cells, model parameters were identified that recapitulated the distributions of cells in the different cell cycle phases. To recover qualitative features of NICD thymidine release experiments, NICD phosphorylation was required at distinct stages in the cell cycle. After using MLN4924 and control experiments to estimate NICD phosphorylation rate the model qualitatively predicts the effect of Roscovitine/PurB treatment on total NICD levels. To address the likely effect of CDK2 inhibition in the PSM, the model was extended to account for position of a cell in the segmentation clock cycle. Following Wiederman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], it was assumed that levels of NICD are anti-correlated with clock somitogenesis frequency. Hence, the posterior PSM is represented by a population of phase coupled oscillators whose frequency is cell cycle dependent. Simulating CDK2 inhibition removes a pool of faster oscillators thus reducing the tissue period.</p>
<p>Notch plays a key role as a gatekeeper protecting progenitor and/or stem cells in multiple developmental contexts, in part through preventing differentiation and in part through regulating components of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Our novel finding of a reciprocal auto-regulatory role between the cell cycle regulated CDKs, CDK1 and CDK2, and NICD turnover has potentially great relevance to the developmental biology community and may provide additional insight into disease/cancer contexts where this autoregulation may have gone awry.</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>Upon separation by SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE<sup>TM</sup> 4&#x2013;12&#x0025; Bis-Tris protein gels (Thermo Scientific) and staining with Instant Blue (Expedeon), protein bands were excised from gels. Samples were reduced with 10mM DTT at 50&#x00B0;C for 30 min and alkylated with 100mM IAA at room temperature for 20 min in the dark.</p>
<p>Digestion was carried out by adding sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Sigma) at a ratio of 1 to 50 (enzyme to substrate) and incubating O/N at 30&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>Peptides were extracted with 100&#x0025; ACN containing 2.5&#x0025; formic acid and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by LC-MS-MS using a linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system. Peptides were typically injected onto a Thermo Scientific 15cm Easy spray column (Part No. ES800), with a flow of 300 nl/min and eluted over a 40 min linear gradient of 97&#x0025; solvent A (3&#x0025; DMSO, 2&#x0025; Acetonitrile, 0.1&#x0025; formic acid in H2O) to 35&#x0025; solvent B (90&#x0025; acetonitrile, 3&#x0025; DMSO, 0.08&#x0025; formic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O). Data files were analysed by Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (Thermo), using Mascot 2.4.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>), and searching against the Swissprot and MRC-PPU (University of Dundee) databases. Scaffold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ProteomeSoftware.com">www.ProteomeSoftware.com</ext-link>) was also used to examine the Mascot result files. Allowance was made for the following modifications: fixed, Carbamidomethyl (C), and variable, Oxidation (M), Dioxidation (M) and Phosphorylation (S, T and Y). Error tolerances were 10ppm for MS1 and 0.6 Da for MS2. Phospho-sites were assigned according to Proteome Discoverer ptmRS when the phospho-RS site probability was greater than or equal to 90&#x0025;.</p>

<title>NICD - Cell cycle model</title>
<p>To account for the experimental observations of NICD degradation in cell lines, we develop a cell cycle dependent model of NICD production and degradation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The position of the <italic>j<sup>th</sup></italic> cell in the cell cycle is represented by a set of <italic>K</italic> discrete state variables, <italic>X<sub>ij</sub>(t)</italic>, defined such that</p>

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn4">

<p>We note that <bold>(author?)</bold> (1) propose a similar model and show that relatively large number of compartments (<italic>K</italic> = 25) compartments can be needed to reproduce experimentally observed variances in cell cycle distribution times.</p>
<p>Letting &#x3008;<italic>X(t)</italic>&#x3009; represent the population average fraction of cells where CDKs are active, then

</disp-formula>
where <italic>M</italic>, the set of CDK active states, has <italic>m</italic> members.</p>
<p>We make the following assumptions about NICD: (i) NICD exists in two states (nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated); (ii) NICD is produced and degraded at constant rates <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub>, respectively; (iii) NICD is phosphorylated by CDK1 and/or CDK2 at rate <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>;(iv) phosphorylated NICD has a larger degradation rate, <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub>, than the background rate, <italic>k</italic><sub>7</sub>; and (v) dephosphorylation occurs at rate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>. Letting <italic>N</italic><sub>1<italic>j</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic> and <italic>N</italic><sub>2<italic>j</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic> represent the amount of NICD and phospho-NICD in the <italic>j<sup>th</sup></italic> cell at time <italic>t</italic>, the population averages are defined to be

<p>As the cell cycle variables are uncoupled from the NICD dynamics, in a typical cell line experiment each of the <italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic>&#x2019;s will tend to the equilibrium value
<disp-formula id="eqn9">

and the fraction of CDK active cells is

<p>LY treatment experiments, in which the production of NICD is reduced owing to gamma-secretase inhibition, are simulated by setting <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0. As PurB/Roscovitine is assumed to inhibit CDK2, the e&#xFB00;ect in the cell cycle synchronised experiments is to reduce the parameter <italic>m</italic>. As MLN treatment inhibits FBXW7 mediated degradation, it is simulated by removing the fast decay mode (i.e. <italic>k</italic><sub>6</sub> = 0).</p>
<p>Now consider a situation in which cells are synchronised as a result of double thymi-dine block. At the point of release the cell cycle distribution is no longer at equilibrium, rather the initial conditions are
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="245704_eqn12.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>S</italic> is a set of states where cells get paused as a result of double thymidine block. After the cells are released from the cell cycle block there are peaks of CDK activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and therefore dynamic levels of NICD.</p>

<title>Somitogenesis clock and the cell cycle</title>
<p>To explore the coupling between cell cycle mediated NICD degradation and the somito-genesis clock oscillator in PSM tissue, we introduce an additional set of variables, <italic>&#x03B8;<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic>, that represent the position of the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> cell in the somitogenesis clock cycle.</p>
<p>As PSM oscillators are coupled via Delta-Notch signalling we consider a phase coupled oscillator model (e.g. 2; 3; 4) of the caudal PSM given
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="245704_eqn13.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>&#x03C9;<sub>i</sub></italic>, the natural frequency of the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> cell, is a functional of cell cycle position, the sum is taken over all oscillators and the coupling function represents the e&#xFB00;ect of Delta-Notch signalling in the caudal PSM.</p>
<p>In a previous model (5) we demonstrated how competition between NICD and Hes7 could yield a phenotype in which increased levels of NICD are correlated with a longer clock period; here we impose this assumption in the phase coupled oscillator model by assuming that the clock frequency is inversely correlated with levels of NICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Hence as the cell progresses through the cell cycle, basal levels of NICD fluctuate and modify the natural frequency. We assume that
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="245704_eqn14.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where the parameter <italic>r</italic> represents the degree of acceleration of the clock when CDK is active.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn13">Equation (13)</xref> -<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn14">(14)</xref> represent a mathematical model of coupled PSM oscillators whose frequencies are modulated by the cell cycle position. The model allows us to explore whether there is an emergent population-scale period and how it is a&#xFB00;ected by perturbing the cell cycle. To do this we simulate a population of N cells and find that given adequate oscillator coupling the oscillators synchronise to an emergent frequency which is an average over the individual oscillator frequencies</p>
