<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Transcriptional pausing underpins regulation of cellular RNA biogenesis. A consensus pause sequence that acts on RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from bacteria to mammals halts RNAP in an elemental paused state from which longer-lived pauses can arise. Although the structural foundations of pauses prolonged by backtracking or nascent RNA hairpins are recognized, the fundamental mechanism of the elemental pause is less well-defined. Here we report a mechanistic dissection that establishes the elemental pause signal (<italic>i</italic>) is multipartite; (<italic>ii</italic>) causes a modest conformational shift that puts RNAP in an off-pathway state in which template base loading but not RNA translocation is inhibited; and (<italic>iii</italic>) can easily enter pretranslocated and one-base-pair backtracked states despite principally occupying the half-translocated state observed in cryo-EM structures of paused RNAPs. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the elemental pause and a framework to understand how pausing is modulated by sequence, cellular conditions, and regulators.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>During the first step in gene expression, transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) at &#x223C;30 nt/s or faster is interrupted by &#x2265;1-s pause events every 100-200 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). These pauses underpin diverse mechanisms that regulate gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), including attenuation, antitermination, and promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang and Landick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).

<p>Multiple pause mechanisms exist, but most pauses that mediate gene regulation are triggered initially by sequence-specific interactions of DNA and RNA with RNAP. An increasingly accepted view is that these initial interactions interrupt the nucleotide addition cycle by promoting entry of RNAP into a state termed the elemental pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landick, 2006</xref>), creating an elemental paused elongation complex (ePEC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The ePEC can then rearrange into long-lived pause states by backtracking (reverse translocation of RNA and DNA), by pause hairpin (PH) formation in the RNA exit channel that alters RNAP conformation (at least in bacteria), or by interactions of diffusible regulators with the ePEC. Recent cryoEM structures of artificially assembled PECs suggest the ePEC is half-translocated with a tilted RNA-DNA hybrid, meaning that the RNA but not the DNA is translocated and the next template base is still sequestered in the downstream DNA duplex. The hairpin-stabilized PEC is additionally inhibited by a rotation of the swivel module (including the clamp, shelf, and SI3) that inhibits trigger-loop folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>High-throughput sequencing of nascent RNAs from bacteria (NET-seq) reveals a consensus elemental pause sequence conserved among diverse bacterial RNAPs and mammalian RNAPII whose effects on pausing <italic>in vitro</italic> are consistent with a block in template DNA translocation sometimes accompanied by modest backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vvedenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Although earlier work establishes contributions of multiple pause signal components (upstream RNA, RNA:DNA hybrid, downstream fork-junction, and downstream DNA) to hairpin-stabilized pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chan and Landick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), the definition of the consensus elemental pause signal has varied and it is unknown if the discrete components affect a common step in the elemental pause mechanism.</p>
<p>Additionally, questions remain about the structure and properties of the ePEC. A longstanding debate is whether the ePEC is an on-pathway state unable to translocate DNA or RNA in a largely unchanged RNAP due to the thermodynamic properties of the RNA-DNA scaffold (<italic>i.e</italic>., a pretranslocated pause; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochkareva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) or if it represents an offline state generated by conformational rearrangement of RNAP that forms in kinetic competition with the on-pathway steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>). Uncertainty also exists as to whether the elemental pause is non-backtracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>) or must be backtracked one or more registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dangkulwanich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Forde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Galburt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mejia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tadigotla <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Maoileidigh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these questions, we combined kinetic analyses of pausing using elemental pause sequence variants or mutant RNAPs with precise structural probes of translocation, trigger-loop folding, and clamp conformation. Our results lead us to propose a multistate model of elemental pausing in which template-base loading in a half-translocated offline intermediate limits pause escape.</p>

<title>The ePEC is an offline state formed in a branched kinetic mechanism</title>
<p>To probe the elemental pause mechanism, we used kinetic analyses of ECs reconstituted on a synthetic RNA-DNA scaffold encoding a consensus elemental pause sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). We first asked if the pause signal always causes ECs to bifurcate into paused and rapidly elongating (bypass) fractions. We measured C17 pause RNA as a function of time when radiolabeled G16 ECs were extended with 100 &#x00B5;M each CTP and GTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E,F</xref>). Most ECs (&#x2273;80&#x0025; at 37 &#x00B0;C) entered a paused state (lifetime &#x2273;5 s; <italic>a</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,F</xref>), whereas some ECs (&#x2273;20&#x0025;) transcribed past C17 rapidly (lifetime &#x2273;0.1 s; <italic>bypass</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,F</xref>). Invariably, a minor ePEC population (typically &#x2273;15&#x0025;) escaped more slowly (lifetime &#x2273; 100 s; <italic>b</italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,F</xref>), requiring double-exponential fitting of the escape rate. Pause bypass was evident from y-intercepts &#x003C;1 in the double-exponentials fits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, the amounts of slow ePEC and bypass fractions varied among RNAP preparations (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). This kinetic malleability of ePECs differed from the reproducible kinetics typically observed for hairpin-stabilized pauses like the <italic>his</italic>PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Toulokhonov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kyzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the ePEC is an offline state formed in competition with bypass nucleotide addition (<italic>i.e</italic>., in a branched kinetic mechanism; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we performed three additional tests. First, we asked whether the fraction of ECs entering the ePEC state increased if GTP (the NTP required for pause escape) were withheld to allow more time for ePEC formation. Unlike for the hairpin-stabilized <italic>his</italic>PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Toulokhonov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), halting ECs at C17 for 15 s before GTP addition did not change the 10-20&#x0025; EC that bypassed the pause (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). However, the bypass fraction was shifted from &#x223C;22&#x0025; at 10 &#x00B5;M GTP to &#x223C;7&#x0025; at 100 &#x00B5;M GTP, suggesting that GTP can affect a partition between the on-pathway EC and offline elemental pause state. Second, using data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>, we found that the bypass fraction varied but appeared to plateau at high GTP (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). Because extrapolation of bypass from bi-exponential fits is an approximation, we next used numerical integration of rate equations as a third test to ask if reaction progress curves are better fit by an unbranched or branched kinetic mechanism at saturating GTP (10 mM; <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A,F</xref>; Methods). The unbranched (on-pathway pause) mechanism did not fit the data well, thus favoring a branched mechanism (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also used kinetic modeling to reexamine the proposed on-pathway pausing reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochkareva <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref>. Using their optimal pause scaffold sequence, we replicated the reported high-efficiency pausing (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D,E</xref>). However, this scaffold positions the downstream DNA end (&#x002B;17) within RNAP, so that forward translocation reduces downstream DNA-RNAP interaction. Consistent with a prior finding that downstream DNA truncation increases pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kyzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), pause bypass was readily detected when the downstream DNA end was positioned outside RNAP as in natural ECs (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D,E</xref>). This result highlights why highly efficient pauses, even if they isomerize to an offline state, may appear to be on-pathway when bypass falls below &#x223C;5&#x0025;. We confirmed the branched kinetic pause mechanism on the Bochkareva <italic>et al</italic>. scaffold at saturating GTP by kinetic modeling (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G</xref>). In agreement with most prior ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kassavetis and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kyzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Toulokhonov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Strobel and Roberts, 2015</xref>) and single-molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gabizon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) analyses of pausing, we conclude that the elemental pause is an offline state that forms in competition with on-pathway nucleotide addition (<italic>i.e</italic>., in a branched kinetic mechanism).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The consensus ePEC readily backtracks by one bp but reversal of one-bp backtracking does not limit the rate of pause escape</title>
<p>The existence of a minor, variable, slowly escaping ePEC population has been a consistent and puzzling feature of pause assays using synthetic scaffolds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We wondered if the slow pause population could be explained by backtracking, an EC conformational change, or a subpopulation of chemically altered RNAP. Variation of the slow ePEC fraction among RNAP preparations (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>) seemed to favor a chemically altered subpopulation. We found that absence of neither the &#x03C9; subunit nor the &#x03B1;CTDs changed the slow ePEC fraction (not shown). More definitively, transcription through tandem consensus pause sequences revealed formation of the slow fraction from all RNAPs arriving at the second pause site rather than a chemically altered, slow subpopulation of RNAP that would be filtered out by the first pause site (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used GreA- or GreB-induced cleavage to ask if the minor slow ePEC fraction was backtracked. Either or both GreA or GreB had little effect on pause lifetimes, even though 2-nt cleavage products, indicative of a 1-bp backtracked state, appeared much faster than the rate of ePEC escape and 3-nt cleavage products, indicative of a 2-bp backtracked state, were detectable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>&#x0026;D). Thus, even though the scaffold structure disfavors &#x2265;2 bp backtracking due to a -12 rU-dG mismatch, ePECs may shift from the 1-bp backtracked state to &#x2265;2 bp backtracked states, at least in the presence of GreA/B. We next tested the effect on both pausing and intrinsic cleavage of a -11rU-dC mismatch that would disfavor even 1-bp backtracking using an RNAP that formed a high level of slow fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,K,J</xref>; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E,F</xref>). The -11rU-dC mismatch virtually eliminated &#x2265;2-nt cleavage indicative of backtracking, reduced 1-nt cleavage indicative of the pretranslocated register, and modestly decreased the slow pause fraction.</p>
<p>The relative ease with which ePECs entered backtracked registers is notable given the half-translocated state observed in an ePEC cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Backtracking of ePECs is detectable both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), but the half-translocated or pretranslocated states appears to be predominant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Our GreA/B and intrinsic cleavage results establish that slow escape from a 1-bp backtrack state explains neither the major nor the minor pause fractions even though the 1-bp backtrack state is accessible. A parsimonious explanation is that the ePEC readily equilibrates among several active-site states, including half-translocated, pretranslocated, and backtracked, with the half-translocated state being the dominant species in which the kinetic block to pause escape is manifest. The slow pause state may be backtracked by &#x2265;2-bp (since 0.006 s<sup>-1</sup> 3-nt cleavage is close to the 0.002s<sup>-1</sup> escape rate; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H,I</xref>), but its persistence in the -11U mutant suggests other changes to the ePEC must also contribute (see Discussion).</p>

<title>The elemental pause signal is multipartite</title>
<p>Available NET-seq data have been interpreted to suggest an elemental pause signal involving just the upstream fork-junction (usFJ and downstream fork-junction (dsFJ) sequences or a multipartite signal that additionally depends on the hybrid (Hyb) and downstream DNA (dsDNA) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vvedenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).

Because a translocation barrier would affect both pause formation and escape, we plotted pause strength (PS; pause efficiency times the lifetime [&#x03C4;] of the major pause species) vs. pause bypass (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Alone, the usFJ, dsFJ, and dsDNA mutants reduced pause strength by a factor of &#x223C;5, whereas our Hyb mutant had an &#x223C;1.4-fold effect (but see larger effects in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochkareva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

<p>The lifetimes of the major and minor pause states were highly correlated for the pause-sequence variants (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). In contrast, the slow pause/pause ratio varied from 0.04 (usFJ) to 0.32 (Hyb-dsDNA) and was uncorrelated with either the total ePEC fraction or the lifetime of the major pause species (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). These results are consistent with a model in which both the major pause species and the minor, slowly escaping pause species pass through a common barrier for pause escape (<italic>e.g.</italic>, template-base loading). The significant variation in the amount of slow pause species provides additional evidence that the slow species arises by kinetic partitioning of a single RNAP population and not from a chemically distinct &#x201C;slow&#x201D; subpopulation of RNAP.</p>
<p>We conclude that the elemental pause signal is indeed multipartite with significant contributions from sequences in the usFJ, Hyb, dsFJ, and dsDNA to a common kinetic barrier to escape from multiple paused states.</p>

<title>Hybrid translocation is not rate-limiting for elemental pause escape</title>
<p>To ask if the barrier to elemental pause escape corresponds to the half-translocated intermediate identified by cryoEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), we next tested for ePEC translocation at the usFJ and dsFJ using a fluorescence-based translocation assay developed by Belogurov and co-workers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In this assay, the fluorescent guanine analog 6-methylisoxanthopterin (6-MI) is positioned in the template DNA (usFJ) or nontemplate DNA (dsFJ) so that an adjacent guanine unstacks from 6-MI upon translocation of the hybrid or the dsDNA; this unstacking increases 6-MI fluorescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We compared translocation of the hybrid or the dsDNA leading to increased 6-MI fluorescence on ePEC scaffolds to a control scaffold previously found to translocate rapidly upon 3&#x2019;-CMP addition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Because both the control and ePEC scaffold encode C as the RNA 3&#x2019; nucleotide and G as the next nucleotide after translocation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B,C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>), differences in their behavior can be attributed to the usFJ, Hyb, and dsDNA. To calibrate the 6-MI signal change from the posttranslocated hybrid, we compared the effects of CMP, 3&#x2019;dCMP, or 2&#x2019;dCMP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref>). A 3&#x2019;deoxy RNA shifts the hybrid toward the pretranslocated register, whereas 2&#x2019;deoxy RNA shifts the hybrid toward the posttranslocated register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). For both scaffolds, 2&#x2019;dCMP gave a 6-MI signal increase comparable to CMP, whereas 3&#x2019;dCMP reduced the signal increase. These results suggested that addition of CMP shifts both hybrids toward the posttranslocated register, although the absolute fluorescence change for the ePEC scaffold was about half that of the control scaffold. Rapid-quench and stopped-flow kinetic measurements revealed that CMP added rapidly (&#x223C;300 s<sup>-1</sup>) followed by a rapid (&#x223C;200 s<sup>-1</sup>) rise in fluorescence signal indicating translocation on both scaffolds.

<p>Because the 6-MI and -10 substitutions in the ePEC scaffold could affect pausing, we verified that the 6-MI ePEC scaffold gave pause fractions (&#x223C;85&#x0025;) and lifetimes similar to the wild-type consensus scaffold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Thus, the ePEC fluorescence signal could not be explained by the &#x223C;15&#x0025; bypass fraction and must have arisen in significant part from the paused species. We also verified that CMP addition occurred fully in the fluorescence assay (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). We conclude that the ePEC hybrid translocates rapidly after CMP addition, resembling the control scaffold. The reduced level of unquenching (&#x223C;50&#x0025; of the control scaffold) could reflect lower 6-MI fluorescence in a half-translocated hybrid, since the ePEC cryoEM structure suggests -10 dC (<italic>vs</italic>. -10 dG in the assay scaffold) remains at least partially paired in the hybrid with an altered interaction with the lid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>). Alternatively, -10 dG may unstack in our assay at 37 &#x00B0;C but the pretranslocated and half-translocated hybrids may be in dynamic equilibrium (consistent with intrinsic hydrolysis readout; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). These results also confirm that most ePECs are not backtracked, which would not unquench 6-MI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref> and S3). Together the data are fully consistent with a view that the ePEC, once formed, may easily fluctuate among multiple translocation states.</p>

<title>Downstream DNA translocation is rate-limiting for elemental pause escape</title>
<p>To test whether dsDNA fails to translocate in the ePEC (as predicted from the ePEC structure), we used an ePEC scaffold for which translocation of the &#x002B;1 dC-dG bp would generate a &#x002B;2 6-MI fluorescence signal (&#x002B;1 dG would shift into an RNAP pocket that aids pause escape; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vvedenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Placement of a dT-dA bp at &#x002B;3 was necessary to generate a strong &#x002B;2 6-MI signal. The changes needed for the 6-MI assay weakened the elemental pause signal but still allowed ECs to enter the pause state (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3H</xref>), possibly to greater extent prior to GTP addition (<italic>e.g</italic>., see effect of GTP in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). For the control scaffold, addition of CMP or 2&#x2019;dCMP or extension with CTP&#x002B;GTP to G19 gave a large 6-MI signal indicating translocation after C17 nucleotide addition. In contrast, the ePEC scaffold gave minimal 6-MI signal after CMP or 2&#x2019;dCMP addition (consistent with translocation in only a bypass fraction) compared to extension to G19, which produced a strong 6-MI signal. These data confirm that the dsDNA in the ePEC does not translocate. Since the dsDNA in the ePEC did not translocate, we used GTP binding to 3&#x2019;dCMP-ePEC and control 3&#x2019;dCMP-EC to assess translocation potential. For the control EC, a clear increase in 6-MI signal was evident as GTP bound in the active site with apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x223C; 400 &#x00B5;M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, inset). This signal, which was reduced by interference from the high levels of GTP present, indicated that the post-translocated register was stabilized by GTP binding to the control EC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, GTP binding was unable to shift the 3&#x2019;dC17 ePEC to the post-translocated register (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We conclude that even the weakened elemental pause signal in the dsFJ ePEC assay scaffold prevented dsDNA translocation and thus template-base loading. Taken together, the usFJ and dsFJ 6-MI data confirm that the half-translocated state detected in ePEC cryoEM structure also forms in actively transcribing complexes, and that template-base loading is the relevant barrier to nucleotide addition in the ePEC.</p>

<title>NTP binding rather than TL folding limits escape from the elemental pause</title>
<p>As a second approach to interrogate the status of the RNAP active site in the ePEC, we tested the effect of the consensus pause sequence on formation of disulfide bonds between Cys substitutions engineered to report TL conformation (Cys-pair reporters, CPRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Previous studies established that a &#x03B2;&#x2019; 937 Cys substitution in the trigger helix near the active site crosslinks efficiently to a Cys substitution at &#x03B2;&#x2019; 736 when the trigger helices formed (folded CPR, F937-736; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Other CPRs (P937-687, U937-1135, or U937-1139) report the partially folded or unfolded conformations of the TL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The CPRs are sensitive to TL conformation when oxidized by cystamine (CSSC) because the CPR disulfide competes with formation of mixed disulfides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These CPRs combined with other probes and a cryoEM structure revealed that the hairpin-stabilized <italic>his</italic>PEC fails to add the next nucleotide because it forms a swiveled PEC conformation that inhibits TL folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>). In contrast, the ePEC, whose cryoEM structure is not swiveled, did not exhibit a restricted TL conformation (compare to control EC; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,D,E</xref>). If anything, the ePEC accessed the folded TH conformation more readily than did the control EC, consistent with ePEC access to the pretranslocated register (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>) that is thought to increase TL folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).

<title>Clamp loosening but not extensive clamp opening accompanies elemental pausing</title>

<p>Even though full clamp swiveling is not required for elemental pausing, we wondered if any change in clamp conformation accompanied formation of the ePEC. To investigate this question, we used a variant of the disulfide bond probing strategy in which three Cys residues were positioned in RNAP such that either the closed-clamp disulfide (&#x03B2;&#x2019;258i-&#x03B2;1044) or the swiveled-clamp disulfide (&#x03B2;&#x2019;258i-&#x03B2;843) could form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>). This Cys triplet reporter (CTR) enabled a convenient measure of the energetic balance between closed and swiveled clamp conformations because the different crosslinked &#x03B2;&#x2019;-&#x03B2; polypeptides could be readily distinguished by denaturing gel electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>). The ratio of closed-to-swiveled crosslinks shifts during oxidation with cystamine likely because the mixed disulfide intermediates destabilize the closed-clamp conformation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, cystamine oxidation shifts the unswiveled-to-swiveled equilibrium toward the swiveled conformation, making it a sensitive assay of clamp energetics. This shift is greater for the <italic>his</italic>PEC (which favors clamp swiveling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>), but intermediate between the EC and <italic>hisPEC</italic> for the ePEC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).

Although the modest resolution of the cryoEM structure makes this assignment tentative, interaction of this conserved Arg with a pretranslocated template &#x002B;1C also is seen in the half-translocated <italic>Tth</italic>RNAP crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weixlbaumer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), in a crystal structure of a <italic>Tth</italic>RNAP open complex formed on the <italic>B. subtilis pyrG</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Murakami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), and in a 1-bp backtracked <italic>Tth</italic>RNAP PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sekine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). To ask if either &#x03B2;&#x2019;K334 or &#x03B2;542 played a key role in inhibiting template-base loading in the ePEC, we generated Ala substitution mutants and compared their pausing behaviors to wild-type RNAP. Because the strong consensus pause sequence could mask the effect of a single amino-acid contact, we also assayed the Ala mutants on the usFJ and dsFJ mutant templates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, &#x03B2;&#x2019;K334A resembled the wild-type enzyme on both consensus and mutant pause scaffolds, whereas &#x03B2;R542A decreased pausing by a factor of 2 on the consensus pause and dsFJ templates, but significantly more on the usFJ template (13X effect of usFJ <italic>vs</italic>. 6X for wild-type RNAP; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Given that &#x03B2;R542 interacts with the dsFJ, these data suggest that &#x03B2;R542 contributes to elemental pausing but less on a mutant template altered near its contact. We conclude that &#x03B2;R542 may help inhibit template dC loading in the ePEC.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our mechanistic study of elemental pausing documents key features of this fundamental regulatory behavior of RNAP. The elemental pause is an offline state that forms in competition with rapid elongation; thus, the pause mechanism requires distinct EC and pause conformations rather than a single state with an energetic barrier to translocation. The elemental pause signal is multipartite. RNAP interactions with the usFJ, Hyb, dsFJ, and dsDNA contribute to the key barrier to pause escape: template-base loading from a half-translocated state that involves clamp loosening and &#x03B2;R542 interactions. Other translocation states that can prolong ePEC lifetime form readily. Based on these results, we will describe a model for ePEC formation and escape and discuss its implications for gene regulation.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>A model for elemental pause formation and escape</title>
<p>To explain how RNAP responds to an elemental pause signal, we propose a multi-state pause mechanism in which pause escape is principally inhibited by inability to load the template base into the active site of RNAP in a half-translocated, off-line intermediate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,B</xref>). When RNAP encounters an elemental pause signal, a modest shift in the mobile modules of RNAP that are in contact with RNA and DNA (the clamp, shelf, lid, rudder, switch regions, lobe, protrusion, fork loop 2, and &#x03B2;DloopII) occurs during translocation. This shift creates or reinforces an energetic barrier to completion of translocation from a half-translocated state in which the RNA transcript has translocated but the DNA template has not, corresponding to the tilted hybrid intermediate observed in cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Comparison of ePEC and posttranslocated EC cryoEM structures reveals movements that slightly reposition these key mobile modules (compare green EC to magenta ePEC positions, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Key contacts preventing DNA translocation involve the lid, rudder, and switch 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) as well as apparent H-bonds of R542 in fork loop 2 to the template dC that may hinder its translocation into the active site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8A</xref>; compare to the conserved Arg in a <italic>Tth</italic>EC, which contacts the backbone phosphate of a template nucleotide loaded into the active site; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vassylyev <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The fraction of EC that partitions into the ePEC state and the height of the energetic barrier to completion of translocation and pause escape are both functions of the specific sequences present in the elemental pause signal (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a suboptimal signal will capture fewer ECs for a shorter overall dwell time).</p>

<p>DNA and RNA in the ePEC can move backwards to form pretranslocated, frayed, 1-bp backtracked, and, much more slowly, &#x2265;2-bp backtracked states (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). At least at the consensus pause, the half-translocated, pretranslocated, and 1-bp backtracked states equilibrate but these equilibria are biased toward the half-translocated state. This bias explains why we observed a fast translocation signal for the RNA:DNA hybrid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and the half-translocated intermediate in reconstituted ePECs by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). The fast equilibria explain why GreA rapidly cleaves a 1-bp backtracked ePEC state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref>&#x0026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">I</xref>; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>); the 1-bp backtracked state quickly repopulates after cleavage even though it is only a small fraction of the total ePEC states. It is possible that GreA shifts the bias toward the 1-bp backtracked state, but mass action &#x201C;pulling&#x201D; of ePECs into the 1-bp backtracked state is a sufficient explanation. Because the cleaved ePEC re-encounters a strong pause signal, we observed little effect of GreA cleavage on pause lifetime. Our Gre A/B cleavage data also suggest a much slower entry into &#x2265;2-bp backtracked states, which may be related to the minor but variable slow fraction of ePECs (see below).</p>
<p>This multistate model of the elemental pause predicts that the pretranslocated and 1-bp backtracked states can contribute significantly to pause lifetime at some pause sequences despite being in rapid equilibrium with the half-translocated intermediate in which the kinetic barrier to pause escape (template-base loading) is manifest. If an ePEC spends only 50&#x0025; of the time half-translocated and 50&#x0025; pre-translocated or backtracked, then the pause dwell time will increase by a factor of &#x223C;2 relative to an ePEC that spends &#x003E;95&#x0025; of the time half-translocated. This is true despite the rapid equilibria because only the half-translocated intermediate can escape the pause and the other states diminish its effective concentration. Shifting to 25&#x0025; or 10&#x0025; half-translocated would lengthen the pause by factors of &#x223C;3 or &#x223C;9, respectively, for the same reason. Thus, an elemental pause signal that favors the 1-bp backtracked state, although different from the consensus signal we studied, would increase pause lifetime. These behaviors have been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gabizon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) or by biasing ePECs using opposing force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Galburt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dangkulwanich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Further, multiple locations of the 1-bp backtracked RNA 3&#x2019; nucleotide have been observed or proposed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sekine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sosunova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). From a mechanistic standpoint, possible entry into multiple 1-bp backtracked states means that their contribution to pause dwell times may be both increased and highly variable as a function of sequence. The multistate elemental pause model makes the distinction between backtrack pausing and non-backtrack pausing a matter of degree rather than a clear-cut division.</p>
<p>Our results do not address the important question of whether the half-translocated state also is a significant kinetic intermediate during on-pathway nucleotide addition, although other studies suggest this possibility. Translocation can affect overall elongation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gabizon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), and a half-translocated intermediate has been directly observed during <italic>in crystallo</italic> nucleotide addition by RNA-dependent RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shu and Gong, 2016</xref>). On-pathway translocation may proceed <italic>via</italic> initial RNA translocation then template DNA loading; the second step may be naturally slower at a pause signal, allowing time for formation of the ePEC conformation in which template-base loading becomes strongly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gabizon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The multistate model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) has important regulatory implications. Just as different regulators can exert distinct effects on the multistep mechanism of transcription initiation by stabilizing or destabilizing different intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hubin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), the existence of multiple elemental pause states affords multiple targets for regulators even when these intermediates are in equilibrium. For example, ppGpp is known to stimulate pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kingston <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>) and to promote backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kamarthapu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>); ppGpp could stimulate pausing by stabilizing a pretranslocated or backtracked PEC. Further, &#x2265;1-bp backtracking may become more significant for other sequence contexts, conditions, or RNAPs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, eukaryotic RNAPII).</p>

<title>Multipartite RNAP contacts, not RNA-DNA energetics alone, drive elemental pausing</title>
<p>Our results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) confirm that, like the hairpin-stabilized <italic>his</italic>PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), the elemental pause signal is multipartite and involves significant contributions from the usFJ, hybrid, dsFJ, and dsDNA. Although strong evidence of significant contributions by the hybrid and dsDNA exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochkareva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palangat and Landick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Palangat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), some descriptions of pausing focus only on the usFJ and dsFJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vvedenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The inhibitory contributions of the usFJ and dsFJ to hybrid unwinding and NTP binding, respectively, have been known since the earliest studies of pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gilbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aivazashvili <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>) but alone are inadequate to predict pause strength.</p>
<p>At least three factors may contribute to underestimation of the importance of hybrid and downstream DNA sequences in pausing. First, the widespread use of sequence logos to represent nucleic acid signals places undue weight on simple, independent interactions and underweights contributions of complex sequence interactions that affect energetics through nucleic-acid conformation or alternative side-chain contacts. Thus, a logo representing information content as single bp can cause complex, multipartite sequences to appear less important (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Although more sophisticated algorithms hold promise to characterize complex, multipartite signals like the elemental pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Siebert and S&#x00F6;ding, 2016</xref>), direct analyses of sequence variants remain the most reliable way to define relevant contributions. Direct mutational analyses establish the key contributions of the hybrid and downstream DNA in the elemental pause signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochkareva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palangat and Landick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Palangat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, using NET-seq to identify a consensus pause signal requires rapid capture of PECs by quick-freezing actively growing cells in liquid N<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Churchman and Weissman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Quick-freezing reveals the modest sequence signatures of the hybrid and dsDNA in sequence logos and energetic analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Larson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, some studies that detected little if any hybrid or dsDNA contribution recovered cells by centrifugation before freezing, which may allow RNAP to escape all but the strongest pause sites and thus could over-represent contributions of the usFJ and dsFJ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vvedenskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Imashimizu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the hybrid and dsDNA contact multiple RNAP modules (<italic>e.g</italic>., rudder, switch 2, clamp, <italic>etc</italic>.) and may principally affect the complex and modest conformational rearrangement into the ePEC state. Because this conformation is still incompletely understood, the contributions of the hybrid and dsDNA, which may involve specific duplex conformations, may be difficult to characterize.</p>
<p>Our findings taken together with earlier demonstrations of usFJ, hybrid, dsFJ, and dsDNA sequences that contribute to pausing should solidify a model of elemental pausing that depends on a multipartite pause signal.</p>

<title>Structure of the elemental pause</title>
<p>The elemental pause is a distinct offline state, not an on-pathway elongation intermediate. Our study uncovered evidence for a modestly rearranged multistate ePEC in which the clamp is loosened and template-base loading is inhibited as well as a slower ePEC state entered by a minor but variable fraction of ECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and S4). The lack of effect of rapid GreA cleavage ruled out 1-bp backtracking as an explanation of the slow ePEC state, but the GreA/B experiments could not definitively rule out &#x2265;2-bp backtracking because the maximal &#x2265;3-nt cleavage rate of &#x223C;0.002 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sosunova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) is too close to slow ePEC escape rate. Alternatively or additionally, the slow ePEC state could involve RNAP swiveling, which is observed in the hairpin-stabilized PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018b</xref>). Swiveling involves a near-rigid body rotation of the clamp, shelf, SI3, and jaw, and inhibits nucleotide addition by a factor of &#x223C;10 by interfering with TL folding. Interestingly, the lifetime of the minor slow ePEC is &#x223C;10 times that of the majority ePEC state. Variations in susceptibility to swiveling, &#x2265;2-bp backtracking, or both could explain why the slow fraction varies among RNAP preparations. Further studies will be needed to establish the structure and importance of the slow ePEC fraction, including detection with non-reconstituted transcription complexes or <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The multistate model of elemental pausing involving small changes in RNAP conformation and half-translocated, pretranslocated, and multiple 1-bp backtracked states described here will be difficult to test fully using ensemble biochemistry, single-molecule biochemistry, or crystallography. These methods are encumbered by the perturbing effects of probes and experimental configurations, the number of intermediates involved, and the rapid time-scale of their interchange. Time-resolved cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frank, 2017</xref>) promises an attractive approach if methods to distinguish intermediates during particle classification can be developed.</p>

<p>To test whether the elemental pause is on online or offline state (<italic>i.e</italic>., involves a linear or branched kinetic mechanism; <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1F</xref> and S1G) and to test whether the slow fraction of ePECs was evident at only the first or at both pause sites on the tandem pause scaffold (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>), we used kinetic modeling by numerical integration of pre-steady state rate equations using the program KinTek Explorer v6.1 (KinTek Corp., Snow Shoe, PA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In both cases, to test whether the simpler mechanism was adequate to explain the data, we used replicate datasets (triplicate or greater) to generate a kinetic model for the rates of arrival at the pause site using the rate at which all RNAs before the pause site converted to RNAs at the pause site and beyond. We then held these rates constant and tested the simple kinetic models (linear, online pause (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1F</xref> and S1G) or two populations of RNAP, fast and slow pausing (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2D</xref> and S2E), including error for replicates to obtain the best fit and the residuals between the best fit and the observed data (see <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1F,G</xref> and S2D,E).

<p>To measure translocation rates of the hybrid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), we used the assay developed by Belogurov and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Malinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). PAGE-purified template DNA and RNA were annealed in TB1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>). This scaffold was incubated with RNAP for 15 min at 37 &#x00B0;C in TB, then non-template DNA was added such that the final ratio of tDNA:RNA:RNAP:ntDNA was 1:2:3:5 (2 &#x00B5;M: 4 &#x00B5;M: 6 &#x00B5;M: 10 &#x00B5;M, respectively). This solution was diluted to 0.4 &#x00B5;M RNAP with TB1.</p>
<p>ECs were then injected into one loading syringe of a stopped-flow apparatus (SF-300X; KinTek Corporation, Snow Shoe, PA) and 200 &#x00B5;M CTP in TB1 was loaded in the other syringe. Upon initiating rapid mixing at 37 &#x00B0;C, 6-MI fluorescence was excited at 340 nm (2.4 nm bandwidth), and emission was monitored in real time through a 400 nm long-pass filter (Edmund Optics Inc., Barrington, NJ). The kinetics of 6-MI fluorescence unquenching was determined by fitting the average fluorescence (n &#x2265;6 traces), normalized from 0 to 1, to a double exponential equation [1]:

<title>Rapid quench-flow measurement of nucleotide addition</title>
<p>To measure rates of C17 and G18 addition, G16 ECs were formed essentially as described for the pause transcription assay, but with 5&#x2019;-[<sup>32</sup>P]RNA limiting such that RNA:tDNA:RNAP:ntDNA was 1:1.3:2:3.3. To obtain nucleotide addition rates using a quench-flow apparatus (RQF-3; KinTek Corporation, Snow Shoe, PA), 400 nM G16 ECs were injected in one sample loop and 200 &#x00B5;M each CTP and GTP in TB1, in the other sample loop. Reactions were performed at 37&#x00B0; C for the designated times and quenched with 2 M HCl, then neutralized immediately to pH 7.8 with 3 M Tris base (supplemented with 250 &#x00B5;g torula yeast RNA/mL). RNA products were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in 1X stop buffer to a constant specific activity. RNA products from all timepoints were resolved by denaturing PAGE and quantified as described for pause transcription assays.</p>
<p>Reaction progress curves were generated for each RNA length (G16, C17<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and G18<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) by calculating the fraction of total RNA for each condition as a function of time. C17 and all RNAs longer than C17 were combined to give the C17<sup>&#x002B;</sup> fraction; G18 and all RNAs longer than G18 were combined to give the G18<sup>&#x002B;</sup> fraction. The averaged fraction at each time-point was then fit to a single-exponential equation [2]:

<title>Equilibrium fluorescence measurement of translocation</title>
<p>To measure equilibrium translocation of downstream DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), G16 ECs were formed in TB1 as described for the quench-flow experiment but without Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> to stabilize ECs and with the fluorescent ntDNA as the limiting component (ntDNA:tDNA:RNA:RNAP = 1:1.5:2:3 with ntDNA at 300 nM). For equilibrium measurements of hybrid translocation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), G16 ECs were formed similarly but with the tDNA as the limiting component (see description in stopped-flow assay section). Fluorescence measurements were conducted using a PTI-spectrofluorometer (Model QM-4/2003, Photon Technology International) with 5-mM path length and 45-uL quartz cuvettes (Hellma Analytics, M&#x00FC;llheim, Germany). Emission spectra were obtained by exciting at 340 nm (5 nm bandwidth) and monitoring fluorescence between 360 and 500 nm (5-nm bandwidth).</p>
<p>For each substrate addition experiment, 60 &#x00B5;L EC was added to the cuvette, incubated for 2 min at 37 &#x00B0;C in the cuvette holder before performing an emission scan (average of 3 traces at 0.25 nm step size). Then, NTPs were added (concurrently with 5 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> plus additional Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> equal to the NTP concentration in the assay) and the incubation was continued for 1 min (5 min for 2&#x2019;dCTP) at 37 &#x00B0;C before performing an emission scan. Between fluorescence measurements, an aliquot was removed to 2X stop buffer to run on denaturing PAGE to confirm nucleotide addition. For the GTP titration condition, aliquots were only removed to confirm initial G16 RNA, 3&#x2019;dC addition, and failure of 20 mM GTP to incorporate following 3&#x2019;dC addition.</p>
<p>6-MI fluorescence was quantified at 425 nm. Background fluorescence from a GTP contaminant was subtracted using signal from GTP alone in buffer. We found that the level of fluorescence from the contaminant varied significantly among vendors and GTP lot, with GTP from GE Healthcare containing the least amount. Reported increases in fluorescence are fold changes relative to the initial signal in G16 EC.</p>

<title>Cys-pair reporters (CPR) crosslinking assays</title>
<p>CPR crosslinking assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nayak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Nucleic acid scaffolds were prepared by annealing RNA, template DNA (T-DNA) and 15 &#x03BC;M non-template DNA (NT-DNA) at 10 &#x00B5;M, 12 &#x00B5;M, and 15 &#x00B5;M final concentrations, respectively, in reconstitution buffer (RB; 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA).

For crosslinking reactions with NTP, 3&#x2019;deoxyECs formed by reaction with 3&#x2019;dNTP were incubated for 15 min at RT with 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM GTP or ATP. Next, EC, ePEC, or his-PEC (final RNAP 0.8 uM and scaffold 1.6 uM) were incubated for 60 min with 2.5 mM CSSC and 0.05 mM DTT (E = &#x2013;0.16) and stopped with 50 mM iodoacetamide. Samples were separated by native PAGE to verify reconstitution efficiency and by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE using 4-15&#x0025; GE Healthcare PhastGel to quantify formation of crosslinks. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a CCD camera. The fraction cross-linked was quantified with ImageJ software.

The U15 ePECs containing limiting CPR RNAP (1 &#x00B5;M) were reconstituted on this scaffold (2 &#x00B5;M, based on RNA) for 15 min at 37 &#x00B0;C in Elongation Buffer (EB; 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 130 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM EDTA, 5&#x0025; glycerol, and 25 &#x00B5;g acetylated bovine serum albumin/mL), followed by addition of 6 &#x00B5;M non-template DNA and further incubation for 10 min at 37 &#x00B0;C to complete assembly of the transcription complexes. Wild-type RNAP was tested as a control side-by-side with CPR RNAPs. Crosslinking of 1 &#x00B5;M ePECs was performed in the presence of 1 mM cystamine as the oxidant and 0.8 mM DTT, for 15 min at 37 &#x00B0;C. An aliquot of the crosslinking reaction was quenched with 15 mM iodoacetamide (final concentration) and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE to confirm formation of the crosslink.</p>
<p>The crosslinked U15 ePECs were diluted to 0.2 &#x00B5;M with EB (without DTT, for crosslinked samples) and incubated with heparin (0.1 mg/mL final) for 3 min at 37 &#x00B0;C. The U15 ePECs were then radiolabeled by extension with 20 &#x00B5;M [&#x03B1;-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP for 1 min at 37 &#x00B0;C, to poise the complexes one nucleotide before the pause sequence.
