<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The microtubule cytoskeletal system is integral to diverse cellular processes. Although microtubules are known for dynamic instability, the system is tightly controlled in typical interphase animal cells. In contrast, diverse evidence suggests that the system is mercurial in the unicellular fresh water green alga, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, but intense autofluorescence from photosynthesis pigments has hindered the investigation. By expressing a bright fluorescent reporter protein at the endogenous level, we demonstrate in real time discreet sweeping changes in algal microtubules elicited by fluctuation of intracellular H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. These results suggest disparate sensitivity of this vital yet delicate system in diverse organisms; and illuminate how pH may drive crucial cellular processes; how plants respond to, and perhaps sense stresses; and how many species could be susceptible to accelerated changes in global environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The microtubule (MT) cytoskeletal system is integral to many crucial processes in eukaryotic cells. The opposing ends of these cylindrical polymers exhibit distinct properties, with the plus end growing and shrinking stochastically. MTs establish the polarity of cells and serve as tracks for positioning and trafficking intracellular components. They could also form complex machineries. One example is the mitotic apparatus enabling accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. These actions require harnessing MT dynamic instability and the involvement of a wide array of accessory proteins and various post-translational modifications (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Song and Brady, 2014</xref>). Not surprisingly, MTs are the target of natural toxins, such as Taxol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weaver, 2014</xref>), and a number of herbicides (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>). Notably, biotic and abiotic stresses alter plant MTs, while Taxol exacerbates stress-induced maldevelopment of seedlings (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wang, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hardham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hepler, 2016</xref>). Yet the mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes of MTs and the broad implications remain elusive.</p>
<p><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is uniquely suited for addressing these issues. The unicellular fresh water green alga has signature features of both animal and plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Merchant et al., 2007</xref>). Like animal cells, it has motile flagella that contain stable MT bundles. Like typical plant cells, the alga is equipped with vacuoles, chloroplast, and dynamic cortical MTs that serve as tracks for the delivery of the enzymes which synthesize the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Paredez et al., 2006</xref>). Curiously, its MT system appears susceptible to environmental changes. Its flagella sever readily when the aqueous environment changes suddenly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lefebvre et al., 1978</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Quarmby, 2009</xref>). The best characterized stimulus is pH shock. Organic acid, such as acetic acid (HA) diffuses across the plasma membrane and then becomes ionized. The resulting acidification in the cytosol triggers nearly simultaneous influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, which signals flagella amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Quarmby et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hilton et al., 2016</xref>). Cortical MTs become fewer and shorter, detected by immunofluorescence and biochemistry 5 mins after pH shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>While live cell imaging will be ideal for revealing these acid-induced responses with higher spatial and temporal resolution, autofluorescence from photosynthetic pigments in chloroplast obscures commonly used fluorescent reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rasala, 2013</xref>). Recently, we succeeded in revealing dynamic cortical MTs by taking advantage of the new fluorescent protein, NeonGreen (NG) that is 2.7 X brighter than EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>), and the relative abundant plus end-binding protein, EB1, as the NG carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>EB1 plays central roles in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Su et al., 1995</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kumar and Wittmann, 2012</xref>). Its N-terminal domain preferentially binds to the lattice among tubulins at the plus end of MTs, whereas its C-terminal domain can associate with a wide array of proteins. The two domains operate in concert to accelerate MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vitre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>) and recruit various &#x002B;TIP effector proteins that function at the plus end. In live cell imaging, fluorescent EB1 exhibits a comet pattern seemingly leading the plus end of nascent growing MTs, where tubulins transition from the GTP state to the GDP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zanic et al., 2009</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). As such fluorescent EB1 has been commonly used to report newly generated growing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Piehl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Matov et al., 2010</xref>). However, binding to the GDP zone increases in a number of scenarios (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tirnauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldspink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tortosa et al., 213</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sayas and Avila, 2014</xref>). What causes the switch remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Using EB1-NG as a reporter, we captured in real time unexpected changes in EB1-NG patterns and MT dynamics signaled through H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. The remarkable sensitivity and the distinct responses in wild type (WT) cells and mutants shed critical insight on the divergence of the MT system, pH regulated processes and the vulnerability of organisms subjected to environmental stresses.</p>

<title>EB1-NG reports remarkable sensitivity of the MT system in Chlamydomonas</title>
<p>The MTOC in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells at interphase is comprised of two pairs of basal bodies (BBs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, top panel). The mother BB nucleates the assembly of the axoneme, a MT-based scaffold that drives the rhythmic beating of the flagellum. Four rootlet MT bundles (thick lines) arrange in a cruciate pattern positioning BBs at the apical end and the other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mittelmeier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Picariello et al., 2014</xref>). These MT bundles consisting of more than two acetylated stable MTs. In contrast, cortical MTs (thin lines) are singular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Horst et al., 1999</xref>) and highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Under widefield fluorescence microscopy EB1-NG expressed at the level of endogenous EB1 from a genomic construct does not reveal stable MTs except the flagellar tip where plus ends of axonemal MTs undergo turnover continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, plus ends of growing cortical MTs appears like the typical comets observed in other eukaryotic cells. Comets emerged from four spots underneath flagella, corresponding to BBs (bottom panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). As shown from the top, side and rear views of cells, comets of nascent cortical MTs travel along the contour of the cell body toward the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, white arrowhead; Supplemental video 1-1). Near the pole comets vanish presumably when MTs stop growing or switch to the shrinking phase. The pattern appears similar in cells resuspended in the commonly used Tris-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) culture medium or 10 mM HEPES buffer (with 5 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>).</p>

<p>The birth of new comets from BBs appeared stochastic. We did not measure the birth rates, hindered by substantial fluctuations and the narrow apical area. Instead we analyzed comet length and speed from the side view. Line scans along the lengths of comets show the typical feature of EB1 comets - the brightest spot corresponds to the area where tubulins are primarily at the transitional state, slightly behind the leading edge of plus ends with GTP-tubulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The distribution of comet speeds shows that MT growth rates varies nearly two folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The dataset from cells in the TAP medium (black bars) skews toward the slow end relative to the Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES dataset (hatched bars). The average velocities are signifantly different (Mann-Whitney U test, p &#x003C; 0.001), at 5.8 &#x00B1; 0.26 and 7.9 &#x00B1; 0.42 &#x00B5;m/sec respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which are within the normal range measured in diverse eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harris et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Curiously, in some long recordings, comets suddenly gave way to a bird cage-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f1</xref>, top panel; Supplemental video 1-2) as if all cortical MTs were revealed by anti-tubulin immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dymek et al., 2006</xref>). Comets returned automatically after &#x007E;1 min (middle and bottom panels). This unpredictability suggests that this pattern is caused by fluctuated intracellular conditions. When cells gradually flattened by the coverslip, MTs also became visible as a broken bird cage with comets (1f2, top panel, t1; Supplemental video 1-3). However, comets disappeared after &#x007E; 100 seconds (bottom panel, t2). Interestingly, after a 30-second dark period, comets returned upon excitation light was switched back (t3). Simply alternating the dark and light period replicated the disappearance and return of comets (t4 and t5). These observations demonstrate that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> MT system is highly mercurial; and suggests that excitation illumination creates a condition that is unfavorable for MT dynamics, but is reversed in the dark. As illumination opens channelrhodopsins that conduct a number of cations and Cl<sup>-</sup> (Nigel et al., 2002; 2003; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hegemann and Berthold, 2009</xref>), we hypothesize that fluctuations of electrolyte concentrations modulate the MT system in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Considering the light sensitivity, we elected to use wide field microscopy and minimal light intensity to test this.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Sequential changes in the MT system elicited by a short HA pulse and subsequent wash</title>
<p>We first used the well-defined pH shock, recording EB1-NG signals in cells exposed to HA in two complementary devices, perfusion chamber and diffusion chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 2a</xref>). Recording of events in perfusion chambers started immediately before injection. Similar to pH shock, all cells were subjected to a swift change of environments as the injected solution was immediately pulled across the chamber by filter papers placed at the opposite end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). However, the initial period was not decipherable due to flowing of injected fluid and unattached cells. For the diffusion chamber encircled by Vaseline, cells were placed at one side, underneath the coverslip and objective lens (right panel). Recording started after 100 mM HA was injected into the opposite side and cells stopped flowing. This design that decelerated the acidification process, captured the events as HA diffused across the field and into cells that were being recorded. However, the precise exposure time was uncertain; HA concentrations increased gradually, deflagellation was less effective; and not all cells were acidified to the same degree at the same time. Also the enclosed chamber cannot be washed.</p>
<p>Following the injection of 20 mM HA/TAP into the perfusion chamber, all comets vanished in the first discernable image taken at &#x007E; 90 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, b1-b2</xref>). After wash with 10 mM pH7 HEPES, comets re-appeared at the BB area within &#x007E; 45 sec and MT dynamics resumed (b3-b5). Thus HA exposure elicits the disappearance of EB patterns either by perturbing EB-MT interplays or causing cortical MTs to pause or disassemble. New dynamic MTs re-form rapidly after HA is washed away.</p>
<p>Diffusion chambers in which the acidification process occurs gradually allow us to capture another unexpected phenomenon before comets vanish. A broken bird cage pattern with a few MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, left and middle panel, black arrowhead) and comets (white arrowheads) appeared before the disappearance at a time designated as 78 second (right panel). To decipher the disappearance, we analyzed digitally enhanced recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, top panels). As shown in two representative cells, overall EB1 signals were fading with time, which could be due to photobleaching, pH sensitivity of fluorescent proteins, disassociation of EB1 or system-wide MT disassembly. Some MTs clearly underwent endwise resorption (arrowheads). Kymographs tracking plus ends of prominent MTs in two rare still cells show that, as expected, comets disappeared before the resorption of the respective MT. Measurements of the slopes show that the initial shortening speeds for these two events are 8 and 13 &#x00B5;m/min but decelerate toward the BB area. These speeds revealed by EB1-NG are in line with the averaged 10&#x00B1;3 &#x00B5;m/min shortening speed of cortical MTs in cultured tobacco cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dixit and Cyr, 2004</xref>), faster than kinesin-13 catalyzed shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>), and slower than the maximal shortening speed (30 &#x00B5;m/min) of MTs assembled from purified tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">O&#x2019;Brien et al., 1997</xref>). Statistics of shortening speed was not analyzed because of few motionless cells and few shortening MTs with a definitive plus end. Tubulin reporters will be more appropriate for shortening analysis.</p>

</fig>
<p>As for cells with EB1 signals detected in the cell body and flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) simultaneously, comets (white arrowheads in left panel) vanished first (middle panel) before flagella (arrow) were amputated (right panel). EB1 signals remained at the BB area but were static (black arrowhead). Contrary to deflagellation within seconds upon HA perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>), the deflagellation in the diffusion chamber takes more than one minute due to gradual acidification. Thus when cells are exposed to HA, shank binding increases, comets disappear, endwise resorption becomes evident and then flagella become amputated. The sequential events occurring in the diffusion chamber are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>.</p>
<p>Lowering intracellular pH elicits Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> influx, whereas Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> prevents MT formation and promotes MT disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Weisenberg, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">O&#x2019;Brien et al., 1997</xref>). To differentiate whether HA-induced changes are due to H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, we raised [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> without adding HA. Calcium ionophore A23187 did not trigger deflagellation or evident changes in the MT system in our hands. This is not surprising since A23187 cannot elicit consistent effects in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (Bloodgood and Levin, 1983). So we simply raised [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>. Perfusions of either HA or CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution elicit Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> influx, leading to deflagellation, although the latter is less efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). WT cells resuspended in 30 mM Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES appeared agitated, suggesting entry of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, top panel). However, flagella remained attached (arrows) and comet activity was robust. When cells were resuspended in 75 mM Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES solution (right panel), cells shed flagella (arrows). Comets already disappeared, while static EB1 signals remained at the BB area (arrowhead). Thus the outcomes elicited by high [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> and HA are similar. The experiments testing the effects of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and hypertonicity will be described in later sessions.</p>

<title>Formation of cold-resistant thick MT fibers in the recovery phase after HA bath</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> expresses Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pittman et al., 2009</xref>), as well as various channels and pumps at different locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fujiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>) to maintain electrolyte homeostasis. We reasoned that altering HA treatment might also change other cations such as Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> or K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. To test this, we extended HA exposure - resuspending cells in pH3, 10 mM HA/double distilled water (ddw) for 5 mins. As expected, EB1 patterns were absent except for the static signal at the BB area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, left panel), mimicking the final outcome of HA exposure in the diffusion chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In contrast, resuspension in pH3, 10 mM HCl did not alter comet activity. Thus, as with deflagellation, HA-elicited changes in cortical MTs are due to intracellular rather than extracellular acidification. Images were taken as cells were washed with Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES in a perfusion chamber. After washing, dynamic EB1 signals emerged at the BB area after &#x007E;50 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, cell I in right panel). Interestingly, nascent MTs were not adorned with a typical comet. Compared to the bird cage pattern, they appeared thicker, fewer and nearly uniformly decorated, as if plus end tracking EB1 stayed behind growing MTs. In cells recorded at a later period (cell II and III, between 60 &#x2013; 159 sec; Supplemental video 3), MT growth decelerated, especially between 109-159 sec. In cells recorded after 180 sec, all growth stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, left panel). This is further illustrated by two nearly identical images taken 20 sec apart of two representative cells (cell I and II, right panels). Notably, some static fibers split, or had more than one comet aligned in tandem (arrowheads). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that nascent MTs generated after HA bath and wash are abnormal, perhaps with a propensity to nucleate ectopically, branching or growing on top of the other piggy-backing as bundles. Kymograms comparing three representative MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, top panels) with growing MTs in the untreated control cells (bottom panels) confirm that EB1 signals extend further toward the BB area in cells recovering from HA bath. MT growth rates, shown by the slopes, fluctuate but were mostly slower than those in untreated control cells. Overall the rates decline until MT growth stops. Thus contrary to thin, dim, transient MT fibers in the acidification phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), MTs formed in the recovery phase after HA bath were thick, short, long-lived and bright.</p>
<p>MTs are cold labile. Cold treatment induces MT endwise resorption <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Muller-Reichert et al., 1998</xref>). To test the stability of these thick MTs formed in the recovery phase, glass slides with a droplet of cells after HA bath and wash were placed on ice for 3 min. Images were taken using the microscope at the room temperature (RT) immediately, about 20 seconds after slides were removed from ice. Unexpectedly, most cells were imaged from the apical end and the focal planes drifted continuously, indicating that cells oriented toward the objective lens and floated gradually during this warm up period. As shown in two representative cells, EB1-decorated MTs after HA bath and wash remained after the removal from ice amidst the drift of focal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, top panels). Thus the thick static MTs formed after HA bath and wash are cold stable. The pattern remained for the subsequent 70-second recording period. In contrast, for the control without HA bath, EB1 patterns were undetectable initially (bottom panels), indicating cold lability. Dynamic EB1 signals gradually re-emerged at BBs after 30 second (white arrowheads).</p>

<title>Testing HA-induced phenomena by using a tubulin mutant and by reducing HA concentrations</title>
<p>In an attempt to decelerate pH-induced resorption in the acidification phase, we took advantage of a tubulin mutant, <italic>tub2</italic>. A missense mutation near the colchicine binding site in &#x03B2;-tubulin increases MT stability since <italic>tub2</italic> cells are colchicine-resistant, and have more acetylated MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schibler and Huang, 1991</xref>). In the EB1-NG transgenic <italic>tub2</italic> cells, the comet pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, top panels) appeared indistinguishable from that in WT transgenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus our assay is not sensitive enough to report increased MT stability. Interestingly though, in the image taken immediately after resuspension in 10 mM HA, the bird cage pattern with a few comet-like spots already formed in every <italic>tub2</italic> cell (bottom panels). The pattern was rather stable, although some MTs seemed to be out of focus intermittently (bottom right panel), suggesting detachment from the plasma membrane. As shown in two representative cells, similar frozen bird cage pattern remained even after 5-min HA bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; Supplemental Figure 4-1).</p>

</fig>
<p>After wash, comets returned (panel I and II) and lengthened as in WT cells. However, comets (white arrowheads) appeared at the plus end of existing MTs first rather than at BBs where nascent MTs emerged. The bird cage pattern gradually faded concomitantly. For images taken 60 seconds and later after wash, comets formed and moved along existing MTs (Panel III, Supplemental video 4-1). This strengthens the interpreted bundling propensity of MTs in WT cells recovered from HA bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These collective results indicate that the mutation in <italic>tub2</italic> hinders endwise resorption elicited by HA exposure, as such the bird cage pattern with cortical MTs uniformly decorated with EB1 is not vanishing; the other responses in <italic>tub2</italic> and WT cells are similar; and old MTs resorb to make room for new ones to maintain the number of cortical MTs. The HA responses of <italic>tub2</italic> cells are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.</p>
<p>We further tested whether we could replicate the bird cage pattern in WT cells with less concentrated HA. As shown in two top view images taken 40 seconds apart immediately after resuspension in 5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, left panel; Supplemental video 4-2), all WT cells had motile flagella and had a dynamic, rather than still, bird cage pattern in which MTs shrink or grow with a comet, as if the entire MT system were revealed by fluorescent tubulins and fluorescent EB1 simultaneously. The side view images recorded 22 seconds apart revealed endwise resorption of a shrinking MT (arrowhead). Only a few resorbing MTs were captured in cells resuspended in 7.5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, right panel). This still cell allows us to plot the kymograph, which shows a tapered endwise resorption with the initial shortening speed of 4 &#x00B5;m/min. All MT patterns and comets disappeared in cells resuspended in 10 mM HA. Therefore, low [HA] increases EB1 shank-binding, rendering the bird-cage pattern. As HA concentrations increase, MTs stop growing and comets are lost. As resorption continues, perhaps even at a hastening pace, comet and bird cage patterns vanish. The 5 mM HA experiment consistently replicates the light-induced sporadic transient appearance of the bird cage pattern in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, f1</xref>). Changes elicited by 7.5 mM HA partially mimics HA-induced responses in diffusion chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b-e</xref>).</p>

<title>The long-lived EB1-decorated MTs are due to the rise of intracellular [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>] but not [K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]</title>
<p>To identify the ion causing the formation of static thick EB1-decorated MT bundles in cells recovering from HA bath, HA-bathed cells were washed with different solutions. Interestingly, as shown by time-lapse images separated by a 10-second interval, EB1-decorated MT fibers formed only if the wash solution contained Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, such as the NaOH-buffered HEPES (5 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) or 5 mM NaCl in ddw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, top two panels). On the other hand, comets resumed profusely if the wash solution lacked Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, such as the KOH-buffered HEPES buffer, 5 mM KCl in ddw or plain ddw (bottom three panels). Therefore, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> accounts for the reformation of thick, long-lived static MTs in the recovery phase of HA-bathed cells.</p>
<p>Since Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> has low permeability compared to K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (Ronkin and Buretz, 1960), we predict that Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> ions from the wash buffer are entering the cytosol when Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchangers are removing H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. To test this, we resuspended WT cells in 10 mM, pH 8 EGTA buffered by NaOH (final &#x007E;21 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). Concentrated EGTA and EDTA are classical tools for creating permeable cell models perhaps by Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> chelation or other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Miller, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tazawa and Shimmen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arikawa and Suzaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Prachayasittiku et al., 2007</xref>). However, EGTA at this concentration does not influence polymerization of MTs from purified tubulins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Olmsted and Borisy, 1975</xref>). As expected, thick EB1-decorated MTs formed after cells were resuspended in Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/EGTA for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left panels). Thick MTs appeared static after 10 mins. In contrast, cells resuspended in KOH-buffered EGTA had vibrant comet activities (right panels). The static EB1-binding MTs in Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/EGTA treated cells were also cold-resistant.</p>
<p>As K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/ EGTA did not affect comet activity, we depleted [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> with K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/ EGTA rather than Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/ EGTA to test if Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is required for the changes elicited by10 mM HA. After 5 min in K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/ EGTA, 10 mM HA resuspension still elicited the bird cage pattern in <italic>tub2</italic> cells, and caused comets to vanish in WT cells. However, cells quickly burst, indicating perturbed plasma membrane. Thus HA-elicited changes in MTs do not require extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite low Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> permeability of the plasma member, we further tested if boosting Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in HEPES buffer to 55 mM with NaCl was sufficient to change EB1 patterns in WT transgenic cells. Indeed, compared to the growing MTs with typical comets in the control cells in the 5 mM group, in the 55 mM group comets were evidently but MTs were growing (panel I). This is reflected by the modest tapering of comet intensity in the linescan plot (panel II). Therefore, high [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> still could raise [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub>, increasing the time EB1 spent at the plus end and thus comet lengths. Despite the long comets, the distribution of comet velocity (panel III) and the average velocity (panel IV) show that [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> at this level only slightly reduces MT growth rate (two-tailed p-value = 0.0497, &#x003C; 0.05). Thus both comet length and MT growth are sensitive to [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>], albeit the former has a higher sensitivity.</p>
<p>To test the effect of hypertonicity, WT transgenic cells were resuspended in 150 and 200 mM [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> for 5 min before imaging. At these concentrations, flagellar motility ceased. As in 75 mM [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>] solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), most comets vanished, although static EB1 signals remained at the BB area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). However, some cells still contain thick fibers (top panel), a signature of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-induced changes. Together, these results show that low Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and high Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> elicit disparate MT responses. The modest increase of [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> from 55 mM [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> alone promotes long comets but is insufficient to stop MT growth. The fact that both responses are triggered by HA bath followed by 5 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES wash or by 21 mM Na&#x002B;/EGTA strongly suggests [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> rises further to a level under 21 mM due to H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchange or passive diffusion through EGTA-permeablized membrane. However, most EB1 signal vanished, suggesting MT disassembly at the concentrations that deem hypertonic for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> either via [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> and/or [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>.</p>

<p>Expression of EB1-NG as a reporter loosens the bottle neck posed by autofluorescence of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and unleashes the potential of this MT model system. Contrary to the perceived stability of the MT system in typical interphase animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lieuvin et al., 1994</xref>), EB1-NG reports in real time the mercurial changes of algal MT system that are elicited by excitation illumination, compression, H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>. We summarize the changes and discuss possible underlying mechanisms; and the new insight on the MT system, plant salinity responses and additional concerns of environmental stresses.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Changes elicited by H<sup>&#x002B;</sup></title>
<p>The changes of algal MT system elicited by intracellular acidification are swift, stunning and novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Among heightened shank binding, diminished comet activity, paused MT growths, and MT shortening, the bird cage pattern of shank binding is the most sensitive, elicited reliably by 5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). They are unlikely signaled through cell death pathways, since these changes are reversible, even after 5 min HA bath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The recovery occurs within a minute, either completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) or protractedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), depending on exposure and wash procedures. Extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> is not required for the HA-induced changes, since they still occur after K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/EGTA treatment. However, we cannot rule out the involvement of Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> released from intracellular storages and other signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Although the pH of [HA]<sub>ex</sub> that triggers these changes is &#x007E;3, we expect that the resulting intracellular pH is close to or higher than 6.3. HA-induced changes in diffusion chambers appear before deflagellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) that occurs at pH 6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Braun and Hegemann, 1999</xref>). Consistent with this, the bird cage pattern could be transiently triggered merely by illumination that may open H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-selective channelrhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f1</xref>). Conversely, comets return to compressed cells when illumination is turned off for 30 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f2</xref>); or return within &#x007E; 45 sec after HA is washed away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that a slight imbalance of pH homeostasis is sufficient to elicit changes in algal MT system.</p>
<p>Although pH affects proteins&#x2019; ionization and thus their functions and protein-protein interactions in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hepler, 2016</xref>), we speculate that the MT system is particularly sensitive to declining pH because of the acidic pI of tubulins and EB1. For example, the respective pI of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> &#x03B1;-tubulin, &#x03B2;-tubulin and EB1 is 5.01, 4.82, and 5.7. A decrease of pH from the resting level will make these proteins less negatively charged, especially at their C-terminal acidic tails that are central to MT-accessory protein interplays and the targets of various post-translational modifications (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Song and Brady, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rovini et al., 2013</xref>). The resulting decreased repulsion could explain increased affinity of EB1 to GDP-tubulin, leading to nearly immediate appearance of the bird cage pattern in <italic>tub2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a-b</xref>) or in WT cells exposed to 5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). As pH descends further, additional changes in protein conformation may inhibit the growth of MTs and EB1 binding to plus ends, leading to comet reduction or ultimate disappearance.</p>
<p>These HA-induced changes explain long standing questions regarding pH variations. For example, the pollen tube tip has overlapping regions. The MT zone, in particular, lags behind the F-actin, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> and acid zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gibbon and Kropf, 1994</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hepler, 2016</xref>). Likewise, a basic shift directs MT-supported fertilization processes of sea urchins, whereas depressing pH inhibits the processes and triggers MT disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schatten et al., 1985</xref>). This and an increase of 0.3-0.5 pH unit in mitosis inspired the pH clock hypothesis for cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gagliardi and Shain, 2013</xref>). In line with this, EB1 preferentially binds to MT plus ends in arrested mitotic phase extract of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, but uniformly decorates MTs in interphase extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tirnauer et al., 2002</xref>) perhaps with a lower pH, analogous to HA-induced bird cage pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Given the role of EB1 in recruiting effector molecules and the swiftness of pH-induced changes in MTs and EB1 patterns, tuning pH may indeed control cell cycle at least for certain organisms.</p>

<title>Changes elicited by Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup></title>
<p>The responses elicited by [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> at low concentrations are distinct. Contrary to instant appearance of H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-elicited bird cage pattern with fine, individual MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), as Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> continues rising, comets lengthen; cortical MTs undergo ectopic nucleation, splitting, bundling, decelerate and stop eventually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Although it takes longer to elicit Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> responses, this is likely due to low Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> permeability. Likewise, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> permeability is tightly controlled. As such [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> cannot be adjusted as nimbly as [H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub>.</p>
<p>The degree of changes correlates with [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub>. These changes aggravating with time in 21 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) indicates that they are occurring before [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> reaches 21 mM, which is made possible by EGTA treatment. As EGTA chelates Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>, this further rules out the involvement of extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>. Similarly, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-dependent responses emerge within &#x007E;45 seconds once HA bath is replaced with various solutions containing only 5 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), suggesting accelerated rise of [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> due to the activity of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/ H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pittman et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, by simply relying on limited passive diffusion through the normal plasma membrane, 55 mM [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> is sufficient to change comet length but only slows down growth rate slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Based on the incremented responses, rather than all-or-none responses to a threshold, we speculate that algal MT system is also sensitive to [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub>, perhaps in a linear manner. Contrary to [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, raising [K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> had no evident effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 a-c</xref>). This is reasonable, given high [K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub>, &#x007E; 70 mM in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Malhotra, 1995</xref>). It highlights the selective sensitivity of the algal MT system to Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and rules out mere ionic effects. One interesting possibility is that Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> binds to particular sites in algal tubulins, analogous to Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> binding sites in mammalian tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Solomon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Serrano et al., 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Common changes elicited by high extracellular HA, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup></title>
<p>EB1 signals largely vanish at 150 mM [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), as in 10 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>) and 75 mM Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) except residual static signals at the BB area. They are likely caused by synergistic disassembly and paused new growth, and an immotile EB1 population underneath BBs respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Yan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). The similar outcomes caused by distinct ions and obvious shrinkage of the cell body at even higher concentrations of Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> suggest that hypertonicity is involved. We envisage that high concentration responses could be caused by one cation exceeding a threshold concentration; and/or simultaneous rises of multiple electrolytes as H2O moves out of cells. Hypertonicity may evoke additional pathways.</p>
<p>The capture of endwise resorption only in low concentration conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d</xref>) suggests that increased concentrations of these ions will heighten shortening-the incidence and/or speed. This is reminiscent to high Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> effects. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> blocks MT formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Weisenberg, 1972</xref>), whereas 0.5-0.6 mM Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> - in the absence of MAPs - could increase shortening incidence and accelerate shortening speed of MTs beyond 150 &#x00B5;m/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Karr et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">O&#x2019;Brien et al., 1997</xref>). Although pH shock and high [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> only temporarily raise [Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> up to 1 &#x00B5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>), the lower concentration may be sufficient to heighten shortening. However, this possibility is weaken by the same result despite EGTA treatment.</p>
<p>Other proteins and signaling pathways are involved in the electrolyte-elicited responses. Kinesin-13 that catalyzes MT disassembly at a lower speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>) becomes phosphorylated within 5 min following pH shock; and knockdown of kinesin-13 ameliorated the pH shock-induced reduction in MT lengths and numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Although EB1 patterns appear fully recovered 1 min after a pH pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), quantitative analysis and using similar reporters are needed to compare the results. Similarly, osmotic or salt stresses activate an atypical tubulin-kinase and phospholipase D to trigger disassembly or reorganization of plant MT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dhonukshe et al., 2003</xref>). For yeast, sorbitol hypertonicity induces frozen MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robertson and Hagan, 2008</xref>) and the recovery in 38 mins involves a stress-induced MAP kinase. Similar paradigms may be responsible for the resumption of MT dynamic in HA-bathed algae that takes &#x007E;55 mins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>The electrolyte sensitivity of algal MT system is contrary to the perceived stable MT system in interphase mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lieuvin et al., 1994</xref>) that have 140 mM [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, and 140 mM [K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pohl et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, we cannot elicit any obvious changes of EB1-EGFP patterns in mammalian epithelial cells by compression or illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Matov et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, both Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> promote tubulin polymerization, with 160 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> as the optimal condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Olmsted and Borisy, 1975</xref>). Different cation sensitivities could be due to sequence divergence. The other is the presence of different accessory proteins. MAPs obscure the cation sensitivity of mammalian MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Olmsted and Borisy, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wolff et al., 1996</xref>). Alternatively, signaling pathways or the capacity to maintain electrolyte homeostasis could differ. Thus while fundamental features of the MT system - likely dynamic instability and EB1 plus end tracking - are universal, electrolyte sensitivity and responses could diverge.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of algal MT system to Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> is consistent with enlarged or clustered algal cells cultured in high salt media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Takouridis et al., 2015</xref>). This could be caused by anomalies in the MT-supported processes in the cell cycle, such as mitosis and trafficking-dependent release of hatching enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kubo et al., 2009</xref>). Yet this fresh water green alga has several strategies to adapt to salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Perrineau et al., 2014</xref>), such as glycerol production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Husic and Tolbert, 1986</xref>), switches in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), sexual reproduction and mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Takouridis et al., 2015</xref>). Salinity adaptation and the incredible H<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> sensitivity of algal MT system that bears semblance to that in both animal and plant cells demand a fresh look at how environmental stresses affect diverse organisms.</p>
<p>One is ocean acidification by anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Raven et al., 2005</xref>). Hindered shell formation from the resulting extracellular acidification with pH declining by merely 0.1 unit has rightfully raised much alarm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoegh-Guldberg, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Waldbusser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitzer et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, 5 mM and 7.5 mM HA differ 0.09 pH unit based on the pK<sub>a</sub> of HA and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but the intracellular acidification from this slight difference triggers distinct changes of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Notably, dictated by CO<sub>2</sub> chemistry, the ratios of permeant CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> to non-permeant ionic forms will increase further as solutions acidify, aggravating intracellular acidification. Therefore, intracellular acidification could be equally, if not more, insidious to marine species that are not equipped to cope with this stress; and may poise to shape aqueous landscapes and drive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cannon et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The other is salt stress and osmostress caused by draught, which is exacerbating due to climate changes or improper agriculture practices. The H<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-enhanced, Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-dependent responses of algal MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) - bundling, cold-resistance and growth inhibition - resemble salinity-elicited changes in plants (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dhonukshe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shoji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hardam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Oda, 2015</xref>). The similarity comports with their common cortical MTs and a great homology of their proteins in the MT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dymek and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>; reviewe by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gardiner, 2013</xref>) except flagellar genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Merchant et al., 2007</xref>). MT changes induced by various abiotic stresses, including salt, have prompted an interesting proposition that the MT system is an abiotic sensor of plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Haswell and Verslues; 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Yet the involvement of signaling pathways and slow readouts in plant experiments question whether the changes of MTs are the consequence of salt stress instead. The EB1-reported, scaled responses that seem proportional to [Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and the speed of manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) in fresh water algae strengthen the possibility that plant MT system is an upstream player in the salinity signaling pathways, if not the very sensor. In line with this, channel-linked MTs are integral to osmolarity signaling transduction in mammalian osmosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</xref>). Using the experimental strategies developed in this study, it is possible to investigate quantitatively the diverged mechanisms of eukaryotic MT systems in sensing and responding to salt stresses.</p>

<p>Glacial acetic acid (HA) was diluted with ddw to various concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 mM. The 10 mM HCl solution was titrated to pH3 with 1 M NaOH. The 1000 mM HA was added to the TAP medium to make 20 mM pH4.5 HA/TAP. For 5 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup> /HEPES and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES, pH of 10 mM HEPES was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH or KOH respectively. To make 21 mM Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/EGTA and K<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/EGTA solutions, 10 mM EGTA was titrated to pH8 with NaOH or KOH.

<title>Live Cell Imaging and Treatments</title>
<p>EB1-NG in live <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells was imaged with Nikon Eclipse widefield microscope equipped with a short-arc mercury lamp, an FITC-HYQ optical filter set, a CoolSNAP-ES CCD camera and MetaMorph software. Each image was captured as a 16-bit grayscale file with 1 second exposure. Streaming videos were recorded for 100 frames at a rate of 1 frame/second.</p>
<p>Typically cells were resuspended in solutions for 5 min unless indicated otherwise. An aliquot of 5 &#x00B5;l cell suspension was placed on a slide and then covered by an 18 X 18-mm<sup>2</sup> cover slip. The edges were sealed with nail polish before imaging. For compression experiments, a 3 &#x00B5;l aliquot of cell suspension was placed on a glass slide and then covered with a 22 X 22-mm<sup>2</sup> cover slip. Cells became gradually compressed by the coverslip as evident by flattened cell body. For pH pulse in a perfusion chamber, an aliquot of 10 &#x00B5;l cells in the TAP medium was placed on a cover slip pre-coated with 5 &#x00B5;l 0.001&#x0025; poly-L-lysine. The cover slip was then inverted to assemble a perfusion chamber as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. The chamber was flushed with 200 &#x00B5;l 20 mM pH4.5 HA/TAP. Subsequently, HA/TAP was replaced by a flush of 200 &#x00B5;l TAP. The entire process was recorded in two consecutive live-stream clips. For this long recording duration, excitation light intensity was reduced to 25&#x0025; with a neutral density filter. For HA pulse in a diffusion chamber, 40 &#x00B5;l cells in 5 mM pH7.4 Na<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/HEPES was placed at one side of a diffusion chamber underneath a 40X objective lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A live-streaming video was recorded following the injection of 20 &#x00B5;l 100 mM pH2.8 HA through the Vaseline wall to the opposite side of the chamber. For HA bath, a cell pellet from 50 &#x00B5;l liquid culture was resuspended in 50 &#x00B5;l 10 mM pH3 HA. An aliquot of 10 &#x00B5;l cell mixture was placed on a cover slip. The cell-loaded cover slip was inverted to create a perfusion chamber. After a total 5-min exposure to HA, HA was flushed away with an aliquot of 200 &#x00B5;l-indicated fluid and then a video was recorded. To test MT cold lability after recovery from HA bath, a perfusion chamber with treated cells was chilled by ice for 3 minutes. A video was taken immediately afterwards, &#x007E; 20 seconds after the chamber was removed from ice. Each treatment was repeated at least twice in each experiment. Individual experiments were repeated independently 3 times at least.</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>To measure EB1 comet speed, a 40-second substack containing side views of cells were first made by the open source image process software, ImageJ (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html</ext-link></underline>); and individual comets were analyzed with a Matlab-based particle tracking software, plusTipTracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Applegate et al. 2011</xref>). In each cell that maintained completely quiescent for the tracking period, all tractable comets which transverse at least one third of the cell length were analyzed. The numbers of qualified cells and comets from numerous recordings were indicated. To generate line scans of EB1 intensity at microtubule plus ends, a line tool in ImageJ was used to measure gray values along the length of comets. Relative fluorescence intensity was normalized after calculation by subtracting a background gray value measured next to the comet with the line tool. Histograms were generated with the Microsoft program, Excel. Kymographs were generated with an ImageJ plug-in multiple kymograph (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/body_kymograph.html">https://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/body_kymograph.html</ext-link></underline>).</p>
