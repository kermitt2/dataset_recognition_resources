<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biointegrated sensors can address various challenges in medicine by transmitting a wide variety of biological signals, including electrophysiological and biochemical signals continuously <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Recent advancement in device designs and fabrication using novel nano-materials have greatly accelerated the development of new soft and stretchable electronics applicable <italic>in vivo</italic>, including brain, heart, and skin <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, it remains technically challenging in the field to improve the stability and biocompatibility of the device and resolve potential infection caused by device implantation. The recent development of genome editing technology <sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> allows us to efficiently engineer cells and potentially transform a small portion of endogenous tissue into an intrinsic and long-lasting sensor of physiological and biochemical signals. However, this intriguing possibility has not been tested before.</p>
<p>The human skin and the skin epidermal stem cells <sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> have several unique advantages, making them particularly suitable for genetic engineering and applications <italic>in vivo</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 1A). First, skin is the most accessible organ in our bodies, and its surface localization is ideal for signal transmission or monitoring. Secondly, the skin is one of the largest organs on the body surface, making it easy to isolate skin epidermal stem cells and to monitor the tissue for potential detrimental complications after engineering and, if necessary, to remove it in the case of an adverse consequence. The procedure to isolate and culture primary epidermal stem cells has been well established <sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Cultured epidermal stem cells can be induced to stratify and differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic>, and transplantation of epidermal autografts is minimally invasive, safe, and stable <italic>in vivo.</italic> Autologous skin grafts have been clinically used for the treatment of burn wounds for decades <sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, despite of the potential clinical applications, the research of skin epidermal stem cells has been greatly hampered by the lack of an appropriate mouse model. Although it has been shown that mouse skin or human skin can be transplanted onto immunodeficient mice <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, the lack of an intact immune system in the host animals makes it impossible to determine the potential outcomes that the procedure may elicit <italic>in vivo.</italic> Immune clearance of engineered cells has been one of the major complications for somatic gene therapy <sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, it remains technically challenging to perform skin organoid culture with mouse epidermal stem cells and to generate mouse skin substitute for transplantation. To resolve these issues, we have developed a new organotypic culture model with mouse epidermal stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic> by culturing the cells on top of an acellularized mouse dermis <sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Exposing the cells to the air/liquid interface can induce stratification of the cultured cells to generate a skin-like organoid <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Transplantation of the skin organoids to wild type (WT) mice with intact immune system has led to long-term and stable incorporation of engineered skin <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In this report, with this unique isogenic skin transplantation platform, our results demonstrated that engineered skin grafts derived from genome-edited epidermal stem cells can serve as an internal biosensor for key biochemical signals, such as blood glucose, allowing long-term and non-invasive monitoring of glucose level <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>

<title>Glucose sensing with cultured mouse epidermal stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Obesity and diabetes are acute and growing public health problem around the world <sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. A biointegrated sensor for noninvasive monitoring of blood glucose level <italic>in vivo</italic> will remove the need for the patients to draw blood multiple times a day <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Additionally, continuous monitoring of glucose allows the patients to better maintain the blood glucose level by altering the insulin dosage or diet according to the prevailing glucose values and prevent potential hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. If the sensor can be connected with an insulin delivery device, it may create an &#x201C;artificial endocrine pancreas&#x201D; that can automatically maintain the glucose level in patients. Currently, most of the continuous monitoring sensors for glucose are enzyme electrodes or microdialysis probes implanted under skin <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. These sensors usually require oxygen for activity, and are insufficiently stable <italic>in vivo</italic> and poorly accurate under the low glucose condition. The presence of interfering electroactive substances in tissues can also cause impaired responses and signal drift <italic>in vivo</italic>, which necessitate frequent calibrations of current sensors. A fluorescence-based glucose sensor in the skin will likely be more stable, have improved sensitivity, and resolve the issue of electrochemical interference from the tissue <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To engineer epidermal stem cells for glucose sensing, we tested the intracellular expression of a sugar binding protein, glucose/galactose-binding protein (GGBP) <sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. GGBP transports glucose within the periplasm of E.<italic>coli</italic>, and the binding of glucose to GGBP can lead to a large conformational change in the protein <sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. This property of GGBP has been exploited to develop protein sensors for glucose using FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) or bioluminescence imaging <sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. WT (wild type) GGBP has a very high glucose binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 0.2 &#x03BC;m). To generate a probe corresponding to the physiologically relevant range of glucose, we engineered a CFP/YFP FRET sensor with A213R/L238S double mutant of <italic>GGBP</italic> (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 10 mM) <sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Although skin stem cells are very susceptible for manipulation with viral vectors, viral infection could lead to genotoxicity and may raise a significant safety concern for the potential applications <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. The recent advancement of genome editing technology with CRISPR system presents a novel approach to carry out a site-specific modification of the target genome non-virally <sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. To test CRISPR-mediated genome editing in mouse epidermal stem cells, we developed DNA vectors encoding the D10A mutant of <italic>Cas9</italic> (CRISPR associated protein 9) <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, two gRNAs (guide RNA) targeting the mouse <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus, and a <italic>Rosa26</italic>-targeting vector. The targeting vector contains two homology arms for the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus, flanking an expression cassette that encodes a <italic>GGBP</italic> fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1B).</p>

<p>Primary epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from CD1 newborn mice, and were electroporated with the <italic>Rosa26</italic> targeting vector together with the plasmids encoding <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>Rosa26-</italic>specific gRNAs. Clones were isolated upon selection and the correct integration into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus was confirmed by both PCR screening and southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Engineered epidermal cells exhibited robust expression of <italic>GGBP</italic> fusion proteins in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). To test the glucose sensing <italic>in vitro</italic>, we exposed the cells to medium containing an increasing amount of glucose. Quantification of FRET ratio by microscopic imaging showed an excellent correlation of FRET ratio with extracellular glucose concentration, ranging from 0-10 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Our analysis further showed that the GGBP reporter responded to extracellular glucose or galactose, but not to other sugars, such as sucrose, fructose, or ribose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The intracellular GGBP probe responded to the change of glucose concentration rapidly. The FRET ratio changed within 30 seconds after replacement of the medium, and remained stable in the same medium. To assess the intracellular GGBP probe more quantitatively, the reporter-expressing cells were perfused with an increasing concentration of glucose. When a stable FRET ratio was reached for each concentration, glucose was removed by perfusion and exchanged with a glucose-free medium. Perfusion of glucose from 0.1 mM to 10 mM led to reversible and increasing FRET efficiency changes (Supplementary Fig. 1C). When exposed to glucose at higher concentration, the FRET efficiency changes followed a hyperbolic curve, reflecting saturation of the probe at concentration higher than 25 mM (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Together, our results suggest that epidermal stem cells expressing the <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter can faithfully sense the extracellular glucose concentration.</p>
<p>Expression of the <italic>GGBP</italic> fusion protein in epidermal cells did not significantly affect cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1E) or differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>) <italic>in vitro.</italic> To confirm that modified epidermal cells are not tumorigenic, we examined the potential anchorage-independent growth of the modified cells. Our results indicate that epidermal stem cells with the <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter cannot grow in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>). As a positive control, cancer initiating cells <sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> isolated from the mouse SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) exhibited robust colony formation in soft agar medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Expression of the <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter did not affect the ability of epidermal stem cells to stratify. When subjected to skin organoid culture <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, the targeted cells readily produced stratified epithelial tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1F).</p>

<title>Glucose sensing with skin transplants <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the potential applicability <italic>in vivo</italic>, we prepared the skin organoid culture with the engineered epidermal stem cells <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and transplanted the organoids to CD1 host animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

To test the glucose sensing capability <italic>in vivo</italic>, we carried out the IPGTT (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test) in grafted animals. Fasted animals were administered with a bolus of glucose intraperitoneally. Fluorescence (FRET) change in the grafted skin was monitored by intravital imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), and the blood glucose level was measured by a commercial glucose monitoring system (Bayer Contour) with the blood samples taken from the snipped tail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> showed the correlation between the measured glucose concentration and the FRET ratio changes over time.

To further evaluate the utility of our sensor in a physiological setting, fasted mice were fed with standard chow diet for 30 minutes, and blood glucose level was monitored afterwards.

<title>Glucose sensing and delivery of therapeutic proteins with a single skin transplant</title>
<p>The unique advantage of our epidermal stem cell platform allows complex genetic engineering to be applied with ease. Thus, introduction of an expression cassette that encodes both <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter and a therapeutic protein into the epidermal stem cells may achieve continuous glucose monitoring and diabetes treatment with one single skin transplantation. The hormone GLP1 (glucagon like peptide 1) is released from the gut upon food intake. GLP1 acts both as a satiety signal to reduce food consumption and as an incretin hormone to stimulate insulin release and inhibit glucagon secretion <sup><xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. These benefits have made GLP1 receptor agonists being used to treat type 2 diabetes. Our recent study demonstrated that skin-derived GLP1 release can effectively reduce body weight and inhibit diabetes development in a high fat diet model <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. To develop skin transplant with multiple functionalities, we engineered a new <italic>Rosa26</italic> targeting vector containing an expression cassette that encodes a <italic>GLP1</italic> and mouse <italic>IgG-Fc</italic> fragment fusion protein together with the <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Fusion with IgG-Fc can enhance the stability and secretion of GLP1 when ectopically expressed in cells <sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. The engineered epidermal cells exhibited a robust GLP1 production and secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3B). Since the ectopic expression of <italic>GLP1</italic> is driven by a constitutive promoter, the expression and secretion of <italic>GLP1-Fc</italic> fusion protein by the skin epidermal cells led to a constitutively elevated level of GLP1 in blood regardless of nutrient or food intake (Supplementary Fig. 3C). The secreted GLP1 fusion protein is functional as the conditioned medium from <italic>GLP1-</italic>expressing cells can significantly induce secretion of insulin when added to insulinoma cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine the potential applicability in diet-induced obesity and diabetes, we transplanted <italic>GLP1/GGBP-</italic>expressing cells and control cells (<italic>GGBP</italic> alone) to two cohorts of CD1 adult mice, and employed high fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity in grafted animals. To minimize gender difference, only male animals were used in our study. Compared with the animals on regular chow diet, the HFD greatly accelerated body weight gain in the mice grafted with control cells. By contrast, <italic>GLP1</italic> expression led to a significant inhibition in body weight increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> and quantification in 3D). To examine glucose homeostasis, we conducted IPGTT. Expression of <italic>GLP1</italic> significantly reduced glycemic excursion <italic>in vivo</italic> as determined by both direct measurement of blood glucose or intravital imaging of the <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>-G).

<title>Glucose sensing with human epidermal stem cells</title>
<p>To test the feasibility of glucose sensing with human epidermal stem cells, we cultured human skin organoids from primary epidermal keratinocytes isolated from human newborn foreskin. The human epidermal keratinocytes can readily produce organoids <italic>in vitro,</italic> which can be transplanted to the <italic>nude</italic> mice. When infected with lentivirus, the grafted human cells exhibited robust expression of the exogenous <italic>Luciferase</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The grafted tissue showed normal skin stratification when stained for early or late epidermal differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). To examine CRISPR-mediated genome editing in human epidermal cells, we developed vectors encoding two gRNAs targeting human <italic>AAVS1</italic> (adeno-associated virus integration site 1) locus, and an <italic>AAVS1</italic>-targeting vector (Supplementary Fig. 4A) that encodes <italic>GGBP</italic> reporter protein. Human epidermal keratinocytes were electroporated with the targeting vector together with the plasmids encoding <italic>Cas9</italic> and the gRNAs. Clones were isolated and the correct integration was confirmed by southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Expression of the <italic>GGBP</italic> fusion protein in human cells did not significantly affect cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 4B) or differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 4C) <italic>in vitro.</italic> The engineered cells stratified and formed skin organoids <italic>in vitro,</italic> which were transplanted to the <italic>nude</italic> host. The grafted skin exhibited normal epidermal stratification and proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 4D-G). With IPGTT in the grafted nude mice, we carried out intravital imaging of the GGBP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>) and observed similar correlation of FRET ratio changes in the grafted skin with blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E and F</xref>). Our data strongly suggest that the skin-based glucose sensor can be used to monitor blood glucose level in human patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Noninvasive monitoring of blood glucose level in a continuous manner can provide significant clinical benefits to the diabetic patients <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The current methodologies of continuous glucose detection mostly depend on electrochemical approaches (enzymatic or non-enzymatic approaches) and optical approach (fluorescence, FRET, ocular spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, photoacoustic spectroscopy, <italic>et al.</italic>) <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>-<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. In order to sense the glucose level <italic>in vivo,</italic> most current technologies have to use invasive sensors that are implanted subcutaneously or intravenously. However, implantation of the devices can lead to significant tissue inflammation and biofouling-induced sensor degradation, causing loss of sensitivity. Although less invasive approaches have been developed, such as iontophoresis, sonophoresis, smart tattoo, and microneedles, these technologies suffer from various drawbacks, including calibration inaccuracy, biological incompatibility, current-induced skin erythema or irritation, significant subject-to-subject variability, and long warm-up or duration time required to collect sufficient amount of sample <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>-<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Thus, the development of novel, noninvasive, reliable, and long-lasting sensor for continuous glucose monitoring will make a tremendous contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Because epidermal stem cells allow efficient genetic manipulation with the minimal risk of tumorigenesis or other detrimental complications <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, the skin may serve as an ideal intrinsic sensor of our own biochemical and physio-pathological signals. We have recently resolved the technical hurdles and established the unique mouse-to-mouse skin transplantation model with immunocompetent hosts <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Our results provide the key evidence supporting the feasibility of cutaneous monitoring of blood glucose level <italic>in vivo</italic> with mouse models. The skin-based glucose sensor provides an accurate and stable glucose monitoring with a wide dynamic range. Because of low immunogenicity of autologous skin transplants, our probe will have superior durability for long term application <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
<p>Given the enhanced sensitivity and non-invasive nature, fluorescence-based glucose sensing has been actively explored for continuous glucose monitoring <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Measurement of the fluorescence signals causes little or no damage to the host. With future improvement of the probe, such as increased sensor expression in the epidermal cells and using FRET pairs with longer excitation wavelength, we can further reduce the exposure time of skin to fluorescence light source for repeated measurements, thus minimizing the potential photo-damages of the skin. The same platform can be also exploited to develop other biosensors and stably deliver therapeutic proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as GLP1, providing a promising treatment for many human diseases <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study demonstrates that grafted skin stem cells expressing a foreign reporter protein can be efficiently and stably grafted to the host mice with intact immune systems, and can be used to accurately monitor metabolic changes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Skin-based gene therapy has been proposed to treat many diseases, including inherited skin disorders <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>-<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and other terminal or severely disabling diseases <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Our study unravels the tempting potential of cutaneous gene therapy for various clinical applications in the future.</p>

<title>Genome editing and selection of engineered epidermal cells</title>
<p>Human or mouse primary epidermal basal cells were electroporated with a mixture of plasmid DNA containing plasmid encoding <italic>hCas9-</italic>D10A, plasmids encoding the gRNAs targeting <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus for mouse cells or <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus for human cells, and the <italic>GLP1</italic> targeting construct. Electroporation was carried out with BioRad gene pulser using Ingenio electroporation solution. Cells were electroporated using exponential decay mode at 250 Volts and 950 &#x03BC;F. Electroporated cells were immediately suspended in culture medium and plated. Cells were selected with puromycin (2.5&#x03BC;g/ml) 2-3 days post electroporation.</p>
<p>Mouse and human cells were electroporated at passage 8-10. Mouse epidermal cells at this stage can grow in feeder-free condition, whereas human cells are continuously cultured with feeder cells. Limited trypsinization or brief EDTA (20 mM in PBS) treatment was used to remove the feeder cells before suspension of human epidermal cells.</p>

<p>Decelluralized dermis (circular shape with 1cm diameter) was prepared by EDTA treatment of newborn mouse skin <sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. 1.5 X 10<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> cultured keratinocytes were seeded onto the dermis in cell culture insert. After overnight attachment, the skin culture was exposed to air/liquid interface.</p>
<p>For grafting with skin organoids, CD1 males with the ages of 6-8 weeks were anesthetized. A silicone chamber bottom with the interior diameter of 0.8cm and the exterior diameter of 1.5cm was implanted on its shaved dorsal mid-line skin, which was used to hold the skin graft. A chamber cap was installed to seal the chamber right after a piece of graft was implanted. About one week later, the chamber cap was removed to expose the graft to air. A single dose of 0.2mg &#x03B1;-CD4 (GK1.5) and 0.2mg &#x03B1;-CD8 (2.43.1) antibodies was administered intraperitoneally for skin grafting.</p>

<title>Cell cycle analysis</title>
<p>Propidium Iodide (PI) staining followed by Flow Cytometry Assay were used to determine the effect of cell cycle profiles. Mouse and human epidermal cells were cultured in two 6cm cell culture dish for 24 hours, respectively. Cells were trypsinized and 1&#x00D7;10<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> cells from each dish were collected, followed by one PBS wash. Fixation of cells was carried out using 70&#x0025; (v/v) ice cold ethanol for 1 hour. Then, the fixed cells were centrifuged at 500g at 4&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes, followed by PBS wash for two times. The cells were then treated with 75&#x03BC;g RNAse A in 100&#x03BC;l PBS and incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for 1 hour. After incubation, the cells were collected by centrifuging at 500g at 4&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes, followed by another PBS wash. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 200&#x03BC;l PBS, in addition of PI solution at a final concentration of 25ng/&#x03BC;l. After staining, the cells were analyzed immediately using flow cytometer BD FACSCanto<sup>TM</sup> II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and emission at 585 nm. DNA content and histograms of cell cycle distribution were analyzed using FlowJo software, version 10 (FLOWJO LLC, OR).</p>

<title>Obesity induced by high fat diet and glucose tolerance test</title>
<p>Male CD-1 mice with skin transplants were housed (5 per cage, &#x223C;8 weeks old) in a central-controlled animal facility for air, humidity and temperature. These mice were fed either a regular chow or an HFD (60&#x0025; kcal from fats, 20&#x0025; from carbohydrates, and 20&#x0025; from proteins) purchased from Bio-Serv (Frenchtown, NJ). Body weight and food intake were measure biweekly.</p>
<p>For Glucose tolerance tolerance test, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed on mice fed an HFD for 10 weeks. Mice were fasted for 6 h before the test. Animals were injected (1 g/kg glucose/body weight, i.p.) with glucose dissolved in saline, and blood glucose was measured at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 minutes using glucose test strips and glucose meters.</p>
<p>To induce hypoglycemia, CD1 mice with skin grafts were fasted for 4 h and injected (2 U/kg, i.p.) with insulin purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Blood glucose levels were determined thereafter at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes.</p>
<p>To examine feeding-caused glucose level change, animals were fasted overnight, and then fed with regular chow diet for 30 minutes. Glucose level was measured at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes with glucose test strips and fluorescence changes in the skin grafts. GLP1 level was measured by ELISA at 0-6 hours post feeding.</p>

<title>Intravital imaging of mice</title>
<p>Optical imaging was performed in the integrated small animal imaging research resource (iSAIRR) at the University of Chicago. Bioluminescence images were acquired on an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA) after animal was injected with luciferin (100mg/kg). Acquisition and image analysis were performed with Living Image 4.3.1 software.</p>
<p>We used the ImageJ PixFRET plugin for image analysis and calculation of FRET ratio. The parameters in the &#x201C;Donor Model&#x201D; and &#x201C;Acceptor Model&#x201D; were calculated based on the donor and acceptor single control images. The following parameters were used for the image processing:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Donor model: Background Donor:FRET=2.28, Donor=14.35. Model Donor:Gaussian Blur=2.0; Linear: a=0.18964, b=-0.02746.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Acceptor model: Background Donor:FRET=1.21, Acceptor=3.93. Model Donor:Gaussian Blur=2.0; Linear: a=0.26711, b=-0.07069</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>FRET model: Gaussian blue=0, Threshold=1.5, Output=FRET/Donor.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Mean value of FRET efficiency was calculated from the output images using the Analyze/Measure function of Image J.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Skin or wound samples were embedded in OCT, frozen, sectioned, and fixed in 4&#x0025; formaldehyde. For paraffin sections, samples were incubated in 4&#x0025; formaldehyde at 4&#x00B0;C overnight, dehydrated with a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol and xylene, and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and subjected to antigen unmasking in 10 mM Citrate, pH 6.0. Sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining or immunofluorescence staining as described <sup><xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. Antibodies were diluted according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instruction, unless indicated.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Excel or OriginLab software. Box plots are used to describe the entire population without assumptions on the statistical distribution. A student <italic>t</italic> test was used to assess the statistical significance (P value) of differences between two experimental conditions (2 tailed distribution unless specified). All experiments were repeated at least three times, unless otherwise specified. For all figures, statistical tests are justified and meet the assumption of the tests. The variance between different test groups that are being statistically compared is similar.</p>
<p>For all the experiments, the sample size was chosen based upon our preliminary test and previous research. There is no sample exclusion for all the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. For <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, animals that died before the end of the experiment were excluded. The exclusion criterion is pre-established. No randomization or blinding was used in this study.</p>
