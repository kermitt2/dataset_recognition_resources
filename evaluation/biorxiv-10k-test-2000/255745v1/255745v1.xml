<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The apical inflammatory cytokine TNF regulates numerous important biological processes including inflammation and cell death, and drives inflammatory diseases. TNF secretion requires ADAM17/TACE, which cleaves TNF from its transmembrane tether, releasing it for signalling. The trafficking of ADAM17/TACE to the cell surface, and stimulation of its proteolytic activity, depends on membrane proteins, called iRhoms. To delineate how the TNF/TACE/iRhom axis is regulated, we performed an immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry screen to identify iRhom-binding proteins. Here we report a novel protein, that we name iTAP (iRhom tail-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein) that binds to iRhoms, enhancing the stability of iRhoms and TACE, preventing their degradation in lysosomes. iTAP-null primary human macrophages, or tissues from iTAP KO mice, are dramatically depleted in the levels of iRhom2 and active TACE, and are, consequently, profoundly impaired in TNF production. Our work illustrates iTAP as a physiological rheostat controlling TNF signalling and a novel target for the control of inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cytokine TNF controls numerous important biological processes (e.g. inflammation, fever, apoptosis, necroptosis, cachexia, tumorigenesis, viral infection, insulin signaling) and is heavily implicated in inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brenner et al., 2015</xref>). Anti-TNF biologics are the highest-selling drugs internationally and there is intense interest in how TNF secretion is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brenner et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>TNF is synthesized with a transmembrane tether, but much of its biology is driven by its secreted form, whose release from the cell surface is catalyzed by the protease TACE (<underline>T</underline>NF <underline>&#x03B1;</underline> <underline>c</underline>onverting <underline>e</underline>nzyme) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>), also called ADAM17 (<underline>a</underline> <underline>d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloprotease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gooz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zunke and Rose-John, 2017</xref>). Other prominent TACE substrates include the activating ligands of the EGFR (<underline>e</underline>pidermal <underline>g</underline>rowth factor receptor), an important pathway that drives growth control.</p>
<p>Given its ability to elicit potent biological responses, it is unsurprising that TACE is stringently regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Murphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gr&#x00F6;tzinger et al., 2017</xref>). A major control point in TACE regulation involves its trafficking within the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schlondorff et al., 2000</xref>). TACE is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a catalytically inactive precursor. For TACE to become proteolytically active, it must undergo a maturation step&#x2014;removal of its prodomain&#x2014; which is catalyzed by proprotein convertases in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schlondorff et al., 2000</xref>). The exit of TACE from the ER and its trafficking to the cell surface requires regulatory proteins called iRhoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mcllwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, iRhom KO mice or cells lack TACE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Christova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Mice null for iRhom2, whose expression is enriched in myeloid cells, cannot secrete TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mcllwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Siggs et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>An important checkpoint to license TACE activity involves its stimulation by agents including phorbol esters, Toll-like receptor agonists and G-protein coupled receptor ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gr&#x00F6;tzinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arribas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hall and Blobel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brandl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wetzker and B&#x00F6;hmer, 2003</xref>). iRhoms play a central role in this cell surface stimulation mechanism. TACE-activating stimuli provoke the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of iRhom2, leading to the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins, enforcing the detachment of TACE from iRhom2, and facilitating its ability to cleave TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the trafficking fate of iRhoms and TACE is coupled until TACE stimulation on the cell surface, when the proteins dissociate and presumably assume different fates.</p>
<p>In spite of the importance of trafficking for TACE regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schlondorff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>), surprisingly little is known about the machinery that controls TACE trafficking to/from the plasma membrane. An exception is PACS-2 (<underline>p</underline>hosphofurin <underline>a</underline>cidic <underline>c</underline>luster <underline>s</underline>orting protein <underline>2</underline>), a protein that colocalizes with mature TACE in endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>) and controls its endocytic recycling. Ablation of PACS-2 in cells impairs the cell surface availability of TACE, reducing substrate cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>). However, PACS-2 has a relatively modest impact on TACE biology <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dombernowsky et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the possibility of unidentified trafficking regulators that may act separately from, or redundantly with, PACS-2.</p>
<p>As iRhoms form functionally important complexes with cell surface TACE and are endocytosed and degraded in lysosomes, modulation of iRhom endocytic trafficking has the potential to act as a regulatory mechanism to control TNF secretion. However, the machinery involved in maintaining stable cell surface levels of iRhoms is unknown. Here we identify a novel protein that we name iTAP (iRhom tail-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein) that is essential for the control of the stability of iRhom2 and TACE in the late secretory pathway. Ablation of iTAP triggers the mis-sorting of iRhom and mature TACE to lysosomes, where they are degraded. Consistent with this, loss of iTAP results in a dramatic reduction in TACE activity and TNF secretion. Our work reveals iTAP as a key physiological regulator of TNF release.</p>

<title>iTAP, a novel interactor of iRhoms, is an atypical FERM domain-containing protein</title>
<p>To identify novel regulators of mammalian iRhoms 1 and &#x2212;2, we adopted an immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (IP/MS) approach similar to the one that was validated in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we generated a panel of HEK 293ET cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged forms of full-length iRhom1, iRhom2, or the iRhom1 N-terminal cytoplasmic tail only. To focus only on proteins that bind selectively to iRhoms, we included several related rhomboid-like proteins as specificity controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, only immunoprecipitates (IPs) from cells expressing full-length HA-tagged iRhom1 or iRhom2 captured endogenous TACE, confirming the validity of the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify novel iRhom-binding proteins, we subjected IPs from these cells to mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed, in multiple replicate experiments, peptides from a largely uncharacterized protein, called FRMD8, in IPs of iRhom1 or iRhom2, but not in control IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). Furthermore, FRMD8 was found in IPs from cells expressing the N-terminus of iRhom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A,C</xref>), suggesting that it was recruited to the iRhom cytoplasmic tail (R-domain) of iRhom, an important regulatory region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hosur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maney et al., 2015</xref>). In light of this, we named the novel protein iTAP (&#x2018;iRhom tail <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein&#x2019;). A closer inspection of the iTAP sequence revealed that it encodes a FERM (band <underline>4</underline>.1/<underline>e</underline>zrin/radixin/<underline>m</underline>oesin) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chishti et al.</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). Proteins containing FERM domains fulfil many important roles, including signaling, and organization of the cell cortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fehon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baines et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moleirinho et al., 2013</xref>). The well-characterized FERM domain contains three distinct lobes that together resemble a three-leaved clover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pearson et al., 2000</xref>). However, unlike most FERM domain-containing proteins, but similar to its paralog KRIT1&#x2014;an adaptor protein in the cerebral cavernous malformation pathway that regulates the establishment of vasculature(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pal et al., 2017</xref>), iTAP contains only the central (FERM-M) lobe. iTAP orthologs are present in metazoans, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Danio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kategaya et al., 2009</xref>). The iTAP protein is expressed broadly and is co-expressed with TACE and iRhom1 or iRhom2 in a range of tissues relevant for TACE biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A,B</xref>).</p>
<p>Independent immunoprecipitation experiments verified that iTAP binds specifically to both iRhom1 and iRhom2, but not to the related rhomboid pseudoproteases Ubac2 and Rhbdd2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). iTAP binds the cytoplasmic tail of iRhoms, since a mutant containing only the cytoplasmic tail of iRhom1 bound iTAP robustly, whereas a mutant lacking all of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic tail (&#x2206;Nterm) failed to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). By contrast, removal of the iRhom homology domain (IRHD), the luminal globular domain between transmembrane helices 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>) from iRhom2 had no impact on iTAP recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). These data indicate that iTAP is specifically recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of iRhoms. Notably, when iTAP-FLAG, but not a panel of control proteins, was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, we detected the binding of endogenous iRhom1 and iRhom2 to iTAP (Table S1). These data confirm that iTAP is a specific endogenous interactor of iRhoms.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) iTAP binds specifically to iRhom &#x2212;1 and &#x2212;2. Human iTAP-FLAG was transfected into HEK 293ET cells together with empty vector or the indicated HA-tagged iRhoms, their deletion mutants or the rhomboid pseudoproteases Ubac2 or Rhbdd2. HA proteins were immunoprecipitated and FLAG binding was assessed by western blot.

HEK 293ET cells were transfected with iTAP-FLAG and iRhom2-HA full length (FL) or the indicated iRhom2-HA deletion constructs shown in (B) Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were assessed for the binding of iTAP-FLAG by western blotting.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="255745_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To delineate the region within the cytoplasmic tail of iRhom that iTAP binds to, we created a series of sequential truncations, or deletions, of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This revealed that amino acids 191-271 of the iRhom2 tail contain the main determinant for iTAP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the cellular localization of GFP-tagged iTAP in fixed and permeabilized mammalian cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, iTAP-GFP exhibited a powdery staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus. When co-expressed with mCherry-tagged iRhom2, iTAP was recruited to iRhom2, which is itself predominantly found in the ER under these overexpression, fixation and permeabilization conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zettl et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>iTAP-deficient cells have impaired TACE shedding activity</title>
<p>To determine the functional importance of iTAP binding to iRhom, we used CRISPR to ablate iTAP in HEK 293ET cells, which was confirmed by the lack of iTAP protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As TACE trafficking and cell surface stimulation depends on iRhoms, we examined the ability of WT versus iTAP-null cells to support TACE sheddase activity.

<p>To investigate how loss of iTAP affected TACE, we examined the maturation status of TACE, a readout for its trafficking and activation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>).

To confirm this, we treated lysates with the deglycosylating enzymes Endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H), which removes high mannose N-linked glycans added in the ER, but not complex N-linked glycans found in the later secretory pathway, versus PNGase F, which deglycosylates both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). This analysis confirmed that iTAP KO cell lines were dramatically depleted of mature TACE. Interestingly, this is a similar, but less penetrant, phenotype to that found in iRhom1/2 double knockout (DKO) MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Christova et al., 2013</xref>), since residual levels of TACE remained in iTAP-null cells.

<title>iTAP is required to maintain iRhom2 stability</title>
<p>The observation that iTAP-null cells exhibited drastically depleted mature TACE levels could be explained by two potential mechanisms. First, loss of iTAP, which binds to iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>; Table S1), could impair ER exit of the iRhom/TACE complex, causing a failure in TACE maturation, as observed in iRhom KO cells. Alternatively, as TACE undergoes constitutive recycling from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lorenzen et al., 2016</xref>) and iRhom2 traffics to the cell surface and enters the endolysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>), iTAP could stabilize iRhom/TACE complexes in the endocytic pathway or plasma membrane. Given the established role of FERM domain proteins on the cell cortex, this second possibility seemed plausible. To investigate the impact of iTAP on iRhom2 stability, we first used RAW 264.7 cells. These macrophage-like cells express high levels of endogenous iRhom2, making its detection more feasible than in HEK 293ET cells or MEFs. Strikingly, endogenous iRhom2 was depleted in iTAP KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>) showing that iTAP is essential to maintain iRhom2 levels. Consistent with this, in HEK 293ET cells, iTAP transient overexpression increased the steady state levels of overexpressed iRhom2-HA and enhanced the stability of the protein, during a timecourse of cycloheximide treatment used to block additional protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This experiment, in which iRhom2 was expressed from an artificial promoter, indicates that impact of iTAP on iRhom2 levels is independent of transcription. As predicted by these results, transiently overexpressed iRhom2-HA was destabilized in iTAP KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>

<title>iTAP promotes iRhom2 stability in the late secretory pathway</title>
<p>To address within which compartment iTAP acts on iRhom2 to govern its stability, we used deglycosylation with Endo-H, to discriminate between the pool of iRhom2 found in the ER, versus the Endo-H-insensitive fraction that has transited to the later secretory pathway. As anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zettl et al., 2011</xref>), the majority of overexpressed iRhom2 is found in the early secretory pathway, whereas iTAP expression, which increased the overall levels of iRhom2, substantially augmented the post-ER proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>To obtain insights into the compartment where iRhom2 and iTAP interact, and to provide hints about mechanism, we examined whether ER versus post-ER species of iRhom2 bound to iTAP. To discriminate between interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, versus adventitious binding post-lysis, IPs were performed using lysates from cells treated with the cell-permeable cross-linker DSP, to covalently trap complexes of iTAP and iRhom2 <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, compared to IPs done without cross-linking, IPs from cross-linked cells showed a pronounced enrichment for the post-ER form of iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>).

<title>iTAP is not required for iRhom2 egress from the ER but promotes iRhom2 stability on the cell surface</title>
<p>If iTAP stabilizes iRhom2 in the late secretory pathway, this predicts that iRhom2 should be able to transit from the ER in iTAP KO cells. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the partitioning within the secretory pathway of the traces of endogenous iRhom2 remaining in iTAP KO RAW 264.7 cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Glycosylated endogenous iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>) is more difficult to resolve electrophoretically than overexpressed tagged-iRhom2. Nonetheless, Endo-H digestion revealed an iRhom2 doublet comprising the ER-localized and post-ER forms, which could only be fully deglycosylated by digestion with PNGase F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). We observed similar results with transfected iRhom2-HA in iTAP KO HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref>). These data confirm that iTAP is not essential for the ER exit of iRhom2, and implies that it instead governs iRhom2 stability in the late secretory pathway. Consistent with this, when we performed live cell imaging experiments (as opposed to the experiments using fixed/permeabilized cells, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) we observed that the co-expression of iTAP-mCherry with eGFP-iRhom2 increased the amount of iRhom2 found on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B</xref>). This demonstrates that iTAP increases the plasma membrane stability of iRhom2.</p>

<title>iTAP modulates the stability of iRhom2 and TACE by preventing their precocious sorting to the lysosome</title>
<p>As iRhom2 leaves the ER in iTAP KO cells prior to its degradation, this predicts that loss of iTAP should trigger the degradation of iRhom2 and TACE in the late secretory pathway, i.e., in lysosomes. Consistent with this, a panel of lysosomotropic drugs that inhibit lysosomal proteolysis by impairing its acidification, rescued the iRhom2 stability in iTAP KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref>). In agreement with the premise that iTAP acts directly on iRhoms, the rescue of mature TACE under similar conditions was consistently more modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref> and data not shown), perhaps because of the slow trafficking time of TACE in the secretory pathway and because iTAP acts directly on iRhoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schlondorff et al., 2000</xref>). In conclusion, our data reveal that iRhom2 is mis-sorted into the lysosome, then degraded, in iTAP KO cells, highlighting an important physiological role for iTAP in maintaining the stability of iRhom2/TACE in the late secretory pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work identifies iTAP as an important physiological regulator of the iRhom2/TACE axis, which is essential for TNF secretion. As TACE is also the sheddase for a panoply of other substrates including ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor, iTAP emerges as an important potential regulator of inflammation and growth factor signaling, during development, normal physiology, infection and inflammatory disease. We show that the binding of iTAP is essential to stabilize iRhom2 in the late secretory pathway, licensing it to promote the cell surface expression of mature TACE, driving signalling (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, delineation of the physiological role of iTAP requires an extensive phenotypic analysis of <italic>iTap</italic> KO mice. Unfortunately, the partially penetrant lethality of <italic>iTap</italic> KO mice, and embryos, limits an immediate definitive analysis of the organismal phenotype, placing these experiments within the scope of future studies and potentially requiring the creation of a conditional <italic>iTap</italic> mutant mouse. In spite of these limitations, we show that mature TACE levels are dramatically depleted in tissues isolated from surviving <italic>iTap</italic> KO pups that escape lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7D</xref>). This reinforces the notion that iTAP is an important physiological regulator of the iRhom/TACE/TNF axis <italic>in vivo</italic>, making it important to dissect fully, in future, the organismal role of iTAP.</p>
<p>An obvious question concerns to what extent the established features and roles of FERM domain proteins apply to iTAP and hence what can be predicted from this, about the regulation of the iRhom/TACE pathway? A general theme is that FERM domain proteins connect the cytoplasmic tails of cell surface client proteins to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, to enhance their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baines et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moleirinho et al., 2013</xref>). While iTAP clearly binds to the cytoplasmic tails of iRhoms, which are found on the plasma membrane, our preliminary experiments failed to detect robust binding of iTAP to actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref>). Besides, we have not identified predicted actin binding motifs in the C-terminus of iTAP.</p>
<p>Future experiments will be required to determine precisely how iTAP stabilizes iRhom and TACE in the late secretory pathway. Notably, some FERM domain proteins are implicated in endosomal sorting, the process whereby endocytosed proteins are sorted in early endosomes, for routing to the multi-vesicular body, lysosome, <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network, recycling endosome or alternatively, &#x2018;fast&#x2019; recycling back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cullen, 2008</xref>). Analogous to the degradation of iRhom2 in iTAP KO cells, loss of Snx17, which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of &#xF062;1 integrins, results in a failure in their endocytic recycling, and lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">B&#x00F6;ttcher et al., 2012</xref>). However, although sorting nexins are intimately connected with the endocytic recycling machinery, this is only one theme within the wider FERM domain family and it cannot be assumed that iTAP directly controls endocytic recycling. Future studies are required to clarify the relationship, between iTAP and the trafficking machinery, to map the vesicular itinerary taken by iRhom/TACE complexes, and to establish the basis of the mis-sorting defect in iTAP-null cells.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to reconcile the role of iTAP in the control of iRhom/TACE stability, versus that of PACS2, which binds directly to TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>). iTAP and PACS-2 both impact on TACE stability, but iTAP can presumably only influence TACE stability when the latter is bound to iRhoms. This is relevant because TACE stimulants trigger detachment of TACE from iRhom2 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>), a mechanism important for facilitating access of TACE to its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). As iRhom and TACE are uncoupled at a crucial stage during signaling, their degradative fates could also be separated, leaving open the possibility that iTAP and PACS-2 may govern different stages in TACE&#x0027;s trafficking lifecycle.</p>
<p>The TNF (and EGFR) pathway(s) are very stringently regulated by positive and negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wallach, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vereecke et al., 2009</xref>). Considering the significant impact that iTAP has on TACE, it is tempting to speculate that feedback into the signaling flux in the TNF release pathway could be governed by controlling the interaction between iTAP and iRhom, or even by modulating the stability of iTAP itself. Future studies are required to investigate this premise.</p>
<p>Inhibiting the activity of TACE has been the subject of considerable pharmaceutical interest for decades, but attempts have failed, often because of cytotoxicity associated with unintended collateral targeting of ADAMs and matrix metalloproteases, that share active site architectures related to TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Murumkar et al., 2010</xref>). As iTAP is a specific regulator of TACE pathways controlled by iRhoms, this makes the blockade of the iRhom:iTAP interaction an interesting potential future novel therapeutic approach for attenuating TACE activity and TNF secretion, during disease.</p>

<title>Generation of iTAP KO cells via CRISPR</title>
<p>For CRISPR-mediated knockout of iTAP in human cells, gRNAs targeting exons common to all transcripts: the 1<sup>st</sup> coding exon 5&#x2019;-GCCCCGCTGAGCGATCCCAC-3&#x2019; or coding exon 4 of iTAP 5&#x2019;-ACGTGTTCTTCCCAAAGCGG-3&#x2019; were cloned into plentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene plasmid &#x0023; 52961), a gift from Feng Zhang. For the ablation of iTAP in human cells, HEK 293ET cells (2.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> / cm<sup>2</sup>) were transfected using Fugene with pLentiCRISPR v2 empty vector, or either of the pLentiCRISPR-derived sgRNA plasmids described above. The next day, the cells were selected with puromycin (8&#x03BC;g/mL) for 3 days until mock transfected cells were eliminated. Cells were expanded and single-cell sorted by FACS or serial dilutions on 10 cm culture plates. To screen for the presence of indels in clones, genomic DNA was extracted from each clone and a 200 bp region flanking the site targeted by the gRNA was amplified for exon 1 (forward &#x003D; CCTCCAGCCCCCCATCCCTGGCTC; reverse &#x003D; GCCAGAGCTACTTCTCCAGGGCTGGGG) or exon 4 (forward &#x003D; TCGGGAGAGGGGAGGGCTAAGCAG; reverse &#x003D; GGGCAAGGTGCGAATGTCCAGGGGTC). Clones with mutant alleles were selected and the original PCR fragments amplified were isolated and sequenced via TOPO TA cloning. The selected clones &#x201C;KO A&#x201D; and &#x201C;KO B&#x201D; which contain indels in all alleles of iTAP, were then confirmed for loss of iTAP at the protein level by immunoprecipitation and subsequent western blot with an anti-FRMD8 antibody.</p>
<p>To ablate iTAP in mouse cells, gRNAs targeting the first coding exon (TTCGGTGGGACCGCTCCGCA) or second coding exon (GCACTACTGTATCATCCGCC) were cloned into plentiGuide-Puro (Addgene plasmid &#x0023; 52963) and used in combination with lentiCas9-Blast (Addgene plasmid # 52962); both gifts of Feng Zhang. For transfection of the gRNAs, 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>5</sup> L929 or 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> RAW 264.7 cells were transduced with 40 &#x03BC;l (RAW 264.7) or 20 &#x03BC;l (L929) of 300-fold concentrated lentivirus encoding pLentiCas9-Blast (Addgene &#x0023;52962) and selected with blasticidin (4 &#x03BC;g/mL, RAW 264.7 and 8 &#x03BC;g/mL, L929). The Cas9-expressing lines were then transduced with the pLentiGuide-Puro sgRNA plasmds targeting the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> coding exons of mouse iTAP. Following selection with puromycin (4 &#x03BC;g/mL, RAW 264.7 and 7 &#x03BC;g/mL L929) the cells were single clone sorted by FACS. To screen for iTAP KO clones, genomic DNA was extracted from each clone and PCR used to amplify a 200bp region flanking the guide sequence (exon 1: forward=TTGAGAGCTTGAGGAGACCA; reverse CAGGCTGGAACCAAAGAGTTC); exon 2: forward=GGAAATGCTGATTGGACCTC; reverse CCTGCTGCCAGACCTTACCC).

<p>A pair of gRNAs (indicated in red) was selected to engineer the deletion of the first coding exon of mouse <italic>Frmd8/iTap</italic> as described in materials and methods. The PAM sequence and the theoretical Cas9 cut sites 3-4 bp from the PAM are indicated. The resulting founder animals were genotyped from tail biopsies and the identity of the lesions revealed by DNA sequencing. Two lines of animals (A and B) were established following germline transmission of the mutant alleles from individual founders. KO line <bold>A</bold> contains a 478 bp deletion that removes exon 2 along with parts of introns 1 and 2. KO line <bold>B</bold> contains a larger deletion of 625 bp that starts within the non-coding exon 1, deletes all of intron 1, exon 2 and part of intron 2, as shown. In both cases, the precise nucleotide sequence on the 5&#x2019; and 3&#x2019; boundaries of the mutant lines is indicated and aligned with the WT genomic sequence.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Model for iTAP function.</title>
<p>Schematic representation of a speculative model for iRhom/TACE fate in the presence or absence of iTAP. In the presence of iTAP, the levels of iRhom2 and mature TACE are stabilized on the plasma membrane, enabling TACE to cleave signaling molecules such as TNF or EGFR ligands. By contrast, in iTAP KO cells, iRhom2/mature TACE are degraded because of mis-sorting to the lysosome, preventing signaling.</p></caption>

<caption><title>iTAP does not bind to features commonly recognized by FERM domain proteins.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) iTAP appears not have a high affinity for actin. HEK 293ET cells transiently expressing vector or iRhom2-HA and iTAP-FLAG were starved overnight then stimulated with or without PMA (1&#x03BC;M) for 30min. PMA was shown to alter the steady state of iRhom interactions with clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>) and hence is used to assess potentially differential binding upon stimulated conditions. An anti-FLAG IP was performed on the cell lysates and binding was assessed by western blotting (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of the location of the NxxY motifs within the iRhom2 sequence. NxxY is a common consensus binding motif for FERM proteins (eg sorting nexins) that participate in vesicular sorting functions. (<bold>C</bold>). iTAP binding is independent of NxxY motifs. HEK 293ET cells were transiently transfected with iTAP-FLAG and vector, iRhom2-HA, single (left hand panel) or double (right hand panel) NxxY>AAAA mutants of iRhom2-HA, or Ubac2-HA as a negative control. PMA stimulation was performed as in S4A and cell lysates were subjected to anti-HA co-precipitation. iTAP binding to in iRhom immnoprecipitates was assessed by western blotting.</p></caption>
