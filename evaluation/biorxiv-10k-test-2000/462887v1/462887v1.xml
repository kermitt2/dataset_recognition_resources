<title>INRTODUCTION</title>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is the sixth commonest and the third most fatal malignancy worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In China, the incidence of liver cancer is high. There are 350,000 new cases and 320,000 deaths per year from liver cancer. In urban and rural areas of China, the mortality rate of liver cancer has risen to the second and the first in malignant tumors, respectively. The invasion, metastasis and recurrence of HCC are the leading causes of death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it&#x2019;s important to explore the mechanisms of invasion, metastasis and recurrence of HCC and to find effective drugs to inhibit the metastasis and recurrence of HCC. Moreover, the establishment of a spontaneous metastatic and observable human hepatoma nude mouse model provide the basis of studying the recurrence and metastasis of human liver cancer and estimating the efficacy of anti-hepatoma drugs. Liver Cancer Institute of Fudan University had established high metastatic human hepatoma cell lines such as MHCC97H, HCCLM3 and high metastatic human hepatoma nude mice model for the treatment of liver cancer which can provide an effective means to study the metastasis and recurrence of Hepatoma. However, these tumors couldn&#x2019;t be monitored continuously and intuitively in vivo. The quantitative of tumor metastasis is not accurate enough <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Optical in vivo imaging, using a very sensitive optical detection instrument, has become quantifiable, highly sensitive to monitor cell activity and gene behavior in living organisms, are being applied in pre-clinical research studies. Optical imaging is divided into fluorescence and bioluminescence. Fluorescence imaging works on the basis of fluorochromes inside the subject that are excited by an external light source, and which emit light of a different wavelength in response. Traditional fluorochromes include GFP, RFP, and their many mutants. Fluorescent luminescence is low-cost and simple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However significant challenges emerge in vivo due to the autofluorescence of tissue. Bioluminescence imaging, on the other hand, is based on visible light generated by the oxidation of enzyme-specific substrates such as d-luciferin for terrestrial organisms and coelenterazine for marine organisms. Bioluminescence imaging does not require excitation of the reporter and has almost no background noise in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, a lentiviral expression vector pCDH-CMV-Luc-EF1-GFP-Puro containing luciferase (Luc) gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCCLM3-Luc-GFP expressing the luciferase (Luc) and green fluorescence (GFP) were constructed. The orthotopic model of highly metastatic and Luc-GFP-labeled hepatocellular carcinoma in nude mice was established by cell suspension injection method and tumor fragment implanted method.. Then we observed the growth and metastasis of tumor in the model nude mice by noninvasive bioluminescence tomography and fluorescence excitation imaging (Fluorescence molecular tomography) at the living level. This study provides a novel and useful method for monitoring the growth and the metastasis of the tumor at living level, assessing the therapeutic effect of anti-hepatoma drugs.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The nude mouse orthotopic implantation model of human hepatocellular carcinoma is an important tool to study the underlying mechanism of the occurrence and metastasis of liver cancer, and it is a new approach to explore anti-hepatoma drugs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. At present, this model is mostly constructed by tumor fragment implanted and cell suspension injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, the two methods have their own characteristics, but there are shortcomings. Tumor fragment implanted method, the goal is to establish a subcutaneous model of human HCC in nude mice, and then to inoculate the liver in order to establish the orthotopic implantation model. The survival rate of the implanted tumor is supposed to increase. Use of this model is limited due to the need for a highly complex surgical technique, especially in bleeding control. Compared with tumor fragment implanted method, the invasion and metastasis of the orthotopic tumor model by cell suspension injection method are better. However, the technical difficulty associated with this model is that it is hard to control tumor cell leakage during injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Analyses are complicated by the fact that apparent metastasis may just be due to leakiness. In this paper, the nude mouse orthotopic implantation model of human hepatocellular carcinoma were successfully established by the two different methods, and their tumorigenic rate were 100&#x0025;. The former takes longer time, and the tumor grow in the implant site of liver. The latter can be shortened by half the time and the tumor can form in whole liver. The micro-environment of the latter is more relevant to the process of tumor growth in clinical practice; thus, it can be a useful research model for study the metastasis and recurrence of liver cancer. The results of this study are consistent with the descriptions reported in the above literature.</p>
<p>To explore the mechanism of invasion and metastasis of hepatoma and to seek drugs which can inhibit the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer, a conveniently monitored orthotopic model of hepatocellular carcinoma in nude mice is essential. As a photoprotein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been widely used in the intracellular molecular imaging because of many advantages such as no need for substrate, low cost and simple operation. However, the excitation and emission wavelengths of GFP are short and they are easily limited by the interference of external substances and the permeability of the spectrum. Therefore, GFP has a high background or is not easily detected in vivo imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Luciferases (Luc) is a generic term of oxidative enzymes that produce bioluminescence, and is usually distinguished from a photoprotein. Luc has no endogenous expression in mammals and it is not affected by other substances, so it can accurately monitor the primary tumor and the tiny metastases tumor. As a reporter gene, luciferase provides an accurate and dynamic monitoring means for early tumor in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, luciferase requires addition of luciferin, the consumable substrate, which is complicated and expensive to perform. In this study, green fluorescent protein and luciferase, as reporter genes, were used for molecular imaging, which combined the advantages of both while can compensate for the deficiencies of the other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The results showed that bioluminescence signal was detected by in vivo imaging on the first day after inoculation of HCCLM3-Luc-GFP cells in the liver of nude mice. As time goes by, the fluorescence signal enhanced gradually, with high sensitivity and specificity. However, GFP showed weak luminescence in subcutaneous and liver in situ, and almost no significant change of the fluorescence signal was detected. In the nude mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, the bioluminescence effect of Luc was significantly better than that of GFP-labeled fluorescence imaging.</p>
<p>In order to establish a spontaneous metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model, HCCLM3, high metastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, was selected as the research object in this study. The orthotopic model of highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in nude mice was established by tumor fragment implanted method and cell suspension injection method,. The tumor and HE staining showed that the liver tumor in situ which was established by the former method only grew in the implant site, and could not transfer to other parts of the liver. The liver tumor in situ which was established by the latter method was detected for intrahepatic and abdominal metastases and the rate of lung metastasis was higher than the former. In addition, we also observed a high abdominal metastases in cell suspension injection group. One of the reasons for this high metastases may have been due to the tumor cell leakage. Because the fluorescence intensity of the abdomen in models, which were injected 20ul human HCC cells, was stronger than that in models with 10ul. Under the premise of being able to build the models, we would like to point out that the smaller volume of the HCC cells was better. In this study,a cotton swab was used to prevent leakage during injection. Cells may leak into the abdominal cavity becauese of post-operative activities. Therefore, we would optimize the method to seal the wound and reduce the cells into the abdominal cavity in the later study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, we investigated the tumor growth and metastasis of HCC in nude mice established by cell suspension injection method and tumor fragment implanted methodc. We also compared the imaging effect of luciferase and GFP in the nude mouse with orthotopic liver cancer model. This study will be useful for establishing a conveniently monitored and spontaneous metastasis orthotopic liver cancer model to evaluate the efficacy of anti-metastatic drugs against hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>
