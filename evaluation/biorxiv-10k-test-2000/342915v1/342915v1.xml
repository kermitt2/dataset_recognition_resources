<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p>Composed of hundreds of microbial species, the composition of the human gut microbiota can vary with chronic diseases underlying health disparities that disproportionally affect ethnic minorities. However, the influence of ethnicity on the gut microbiota remains largely unexplored and lacks reproducible generalizations across studies. By distilling associations between ethnicity and gut microbiota variation in two American datasets including 1,673 individuals, we report 12 microbial genera and families that reproducibly vary by ethnicity. Interestingly, a majority of these microbial taxa, including the most heritable bacterial family, Christensenellaceae, overlap with genetically-associated lineages and form co-occurring clusters of taxa linked by similar fermentative and methanogenic metabolic processes. These results demonstrate recurrent associations between specific taxa in the gut microbiota and ethnicity, providing hypotheses for examining specific members of the gut microbiota as mediators of health disparities.</p>

<sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human gut microbiota at fine resolution varies extensively between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and this variability frequently associates with diet(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), age(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), sex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), body mass index (BMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and diseases presenting as health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The overlapping risk factors and burden of many chronic diseases disproportionally affect ethnic minorities in the United States, yet the underlying biological mechanisms mediating these substantial disparities largely remain unexplained. Recent evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that ethnicity associates with microbial abundance, specifically in the oral cavity, gut, and vagina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Ethnicity can capture many facets of biological variation including social, economic and cultural variation as well as aspects of human genetic variation and biogeographical ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Despite the importance of understanding the interconnections between ethnicity, microbiota, and health disparities, there are no replicated generalizations about the influence of ethnicity on variation in the gut microbiota and specific microbial taxa in diverse American populations, even for healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we comprehensively examine connections between self-declared ethnicity and gut microbiota variation in more than a thousand individuals sampled by the American Gut Project (AGP, N=1375) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and the Human Microbiome Project (HMP, N=298) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Human genetic diversity in the HMP has been shown to associate with differences in microbiota composition, and it has been demonstrated that genetic population structure within the HMP partially delineates self-declared ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Ethnicity was not found to have a significant association with microbiota composition in a middle-eastern population, however microbiota influencing factors such as lifestyle and environment across participants was homogenous compared to the ethnic, sociocultural, economic, and dietary diversity found within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a"><title>Ethnicity subtly demarcates microbiota</title>
<p>We first evaluate gut microbiota distinguishability between AGP ethnicities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>, family taxonomic level, Asians-Pacific Islanders (N=88), Caucasians (N=1237), Hispanics (N=37), and African Americans (N=13)), sexes (female (N=657), male (N=718)), age groups (years grouped by decade), and categorical BMI (underweight (N=70), normal (N=873), overweight (N=318), and obese (N=114)) (Demographic details in <bold>S1 Table</bold>). 97&#x0025; Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) generated for each dataset are utilized throughout to maintain consistency with other published literature, however microbial taxonomy of the HMP is reassigned using the Greengenes reference database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). While interindividual microbiota heterogeneity dominates, Analyses of Similarity (ANOSIM) reveal subtle but significant degrees of total microbiota distinguishability for ethnicity, BMI, and sex, but not for age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>, Ethnicity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>, BMI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>, Sex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E</xref>, Age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Recognizing that subtle microbiota distinguishability between ethnicities may be spurious, we independently replicate the ANOSIM results from HMP African Americans (N=10), Asians (N=34), Caucasians (N=211) and Hispanics (N=43) (<bold>S2A Table</bold>, R=0.065, p=0.044), and observe no significant distinguishability for BMI, sex, and age. Higher rarefaction depths increase microbiota distinguishability in the AGP across various beta diversity metrics and categorical factors (<bold>S2B Table</bold>), and significance increases when individuals from overrepresented ethnicities are subsampled from the average beta diversity distance matrix (<bold>S2C Table</bold>). Supporting the ANOSIM results, Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) models with four different beta diversity metrics showed that while all factors had subtle but significant associations with microbiota variation when combined in a single model, effect sizes were highest for ethnicity in 7 out of 8 comparisons across beta diversity metrics and rarefaction depths in the AGP and HMP (<bold>S2D Table</bold>). We additionally test microbiota distinguishability by measuring the correlation between beta diversity and ethnicity, BMI, sex, and age with an adapted BioEnv test (<bold>S2E Table</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Similar degrees of microbiota structuring occur when all factors are incorporated (Spearman Rho=0.055, p-values: Ethnicity=0.057, BMI&#x003C;0.001, Sex&#x003C;0.001, Age=0.564). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated the relative phylum abundance, with each representing between 35&#x0025; and 54&#x0025; of the total microbiota across ethnicities (<bold>S1 Fig</bold>).

Caucasian points are reduced in size to allow clearer visualization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="342915_fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>We next test for ethnicity signatures in the gut microbiota by analyzing alpha and beta diversity, abundance and ubiquity distributions, distinguishability, and classification accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Shannon&#x2019;s Alpha Diversity Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), which weights both microbial community richness (Observed OTUs) and evenness (Equitability), significantly varies across ethnicities in the AGP dataset (Kruskal Wallis, p=2.8e-8) with the following ranks: Hispanics &#x003E; Caucasians &#x003E; Asian-Pacific Islanders &#x003E; African Americans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). Some of these results replicate in the HMP dataset, where we find a significantly lower Shannon diversity for Asian-Pacific Islanders relative to Caucasians, and a trend of lower Shannon diversity for Asian-Pacific Islanders relative to Hispanics. Five alpha diversity metrics, two rarefaction depths, and separate analyses of Observed OTUs and Equitability generally confirm the results (<bold>S3A Table</bold>).</p>

(B) Left extending violin plots represent intra-ethnic distances for each ethnicity, and right extending violin plots depict all inter-ethnic distances. Center lines depict the mean beta diversity.

<p>If ethnicity impacts microbiota composition, pairwise beta diversity distances (ranging from 0/completely dissimilar to 1/identical) will be greater between ethnicities than within ethnicities. While average gut microbiota beta diversities across all individuals are high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>, Bray-Curtis=0.808), beta diversities between individuals of the same ethnicity (intra-ethnic, Bray-Curtis=0.806) are subtly, but significantly, lower than those between ethnicities in both the AGP (inter-ethnic, Bray-Curtis=0.814) and HMP datasets (intra-ethnic, Bray-Curtis=0.870 versus inter-ethnic, Bray-Curtis=0.877). We confirm AGP results by subsampling individuals from overrepresented ethnicities across beta metrics and rarefaction depths (<bold>S4A-4B Tables</bold>). Finally, we repeat analyses across beta metrics and rarefaction depths using only the average distance of each individual to all individuals from the ethnicity to which they are compared (<bold>S4C-4D Tables</bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we explore inter-ethnic variation in the number of OTUs shared in at least 50&#x0025; of individuals within an ethnicity. Out of 5,591 OTUs in the total AGP dataset, 101 (1.8&#x0025;) meet this ubiquity cutoff in all ethnicities, and 293 (5.2&#x0025;) unique OTUs meet the cutoff within at least one ethnicity. Hispanics share the most ubiquitous OTUs and have the lowest average abundance/ubiquity (A/U) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>), indicating higher stability of lower abundance shared OTUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This result potentially explains their significantly lower intra-ethnic beta diversity distance and thus higher microbial community overlap relative to the other ethnicities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). Comparisons in the AGP between the higher sampled Hispanic, Caucasian, and Asian-Pacific Islander ethnicities also reveal a trend wherein higher intra-ethnic community overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>) parallels higher numbers of ubiquitous OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>), higher Shannon Alpha diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), and higher stability of ubiquitous OTUs as measured by the abundance/ubiquity (A/U) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next assess whether a single ethnicity disproportionately impacts total gut microbiota distinguishability in the AGP by comparing ANOSIM results from the consensus beta diversity distance matrix when each ethnicity is sequentially removed from the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref> and <bold>S2E Table</bold>). Distinguishability remains unchanged when the few African Americans are removed, but is lost upon removal of Asian-Pacific Islanders or Caucasians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). Notably, removal of Hispanics increases distinguishability among the remaining ethnicities, which may be due to higher degree of beta diversity overlap observed between Hispanics and other ethnicities (<bold>S4B Table</bold>). Results conform across rarefaction depths and beta diversity metrics (<bold>S2F Table</bold>), and pairwise combinations show strong distinguishability between African Americans and Hispanics (ANOSIM, R=0.234, p=0.005), and Asian-Pacific Islanders and Caucasians (ANOSIM, R=0.157, p&#x003C;0.001).</p>
<p>Finally, to complement evaluation with ecological alpha and beta diversity we implement a random forest supervised learning algorithm to classify gut microbiota from genus level community profiles into their respective ethnicity. We build four one-versus-all binary classifiers to classify samples from each ethnicity compared to the rest, and use two different sampling approaches to train the models, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and down-sampling, for overcoming uneven representation of ethnicities in both the datasets (see Methods). Given that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (or AUC) of a random guessing classifier is 0.5, the models classify each ethnicity fairly well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>) with average AUCs across sampling techniques and datasets of 0.78 for Asian-Pacific Islanders, 0.76 for African Americans, 0.69 for Hispanics, and 0.70 for Caucasians.</p>

<sec id="s2b"><title>Recurrent taxa associations with ethnicity</title>
<p>Subtle to moderate ethnicity-associated variation in microbial communities may in part be strongly driven by differential abundance of certain microbial lineages. We find that 16.2&#x0025; (130/802) of the AGP taxa and 20.6&#x0025; (45/218) of HMP taxa across all classification levels (i.e. phylum to genus, <bold>S5 Table</bold>) significantly vary in abundance across ethnicities (Kruskal-Wallis, p<sub>FDR</sub>&#x003C;0.05). Between datasets, 19.2&#x0025; (25/130) of the AGP and 55.6&#x0025; (25/45) of the HMP varying lineages replicate in the other dataset, representing a significantly greater degree of overlap than would be expected by chance (AGP replicated, Fisher&#x2019;s exact one-tailed test, expected 5&#x0025; overlap (7 overlapping vs. 123 not overlapping) and observed (25 overlapping vs. 105 not overlapping), p=5.26e-4; HMP replicated, Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, expected 5&#x0025; overlap (2 overlapping vs. 43 not overlapping) and observed (25 overlapping vs. 20 not overlapping), p=4.72e-8; ethnic permutation analysis of overlap, p&#x003C;0.001 each taxonomic level and all taxonomic levels combined). The highest replication of taxonomic lineages varying by abundance occurs with 22.0&#x0025; (9/41) of families across datasets, followed by genus with 13.4&#x0025; (9/67).</p>
<p>Among 18 reproducible lineages, we categorize 12 as unique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>) and exclude 6 where nearly identical abundance profiles between family/genus taxonomy overlap. Comparing relative abundance differences between pairs of ethnicities for these 12 taxa in AGP and HMP reveals 20 out of 30 significant (p&#x003C;0.05, Mann-Whitney-U) differences replicated. Intriguingly, all reproducible pairwise differences are a result of decreases in Asian-Pacific Islanders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig 4.</label><caption><title>Ethnicity-associated taxa match between the HMP and AGP.</title><p>Barplots depict the log10 transformed relative abundance for individuals possessing the respective taxon within each ethnicity, ubiquity appears above (AGP) or below (HMP) bars, and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles are shown with extending whiskers. Mann-Whitney-U tests evaluate differences in abundance and ubiquity for all individuals between pairs of ethnicities; for example, the direction of change in Victivallaceae is driven by ubiquity while abundance is higher for those possessing the taxon. Significance values are Bonferroni corrected for the six tests within each taxon and dataset, and bold p-values indicate that significance (p&#x003C;0.05) and direction of change replicate in the AGP and HMP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="342915_fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>We also test taxon abundance and presence/absence associations with ethnicity separately in the AGP using linear and logistic regression models respectively, and we repeat the analysis while incorporating categorical sex and continuous age and BMI as covariates (<bold>S6 Table</bold>). Clustering microbial families based on their abundance correlation reveals two co-occurrence clusters: (i) a distinct cluster of six Firmicutes and Tenericutes families in the HMP and (ii) an overlapping but more diverse cluster of 20 families in the AGP (<bold>S2 Fig</bold>). Nine of the 12 taxa found to recurrently vary in abundance across ethnicities are represented in these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>), with four appearing within both clusters, and the other five appearing either within or closely correlated with members of both clusters (<bold>S2 Fig</bold>). Further, 90&#x0025; (18/20) of families in the AGP cluster and 66&#x0025; (4/6) of taxa in the HMP cluster significantly vary in abundance across ethnicities. Taken together, these results establish general overlap of the most significantly ethnically-associated taxa between the three methods, reproducibility of microbial abundances that vary between ethnicities across datasets, and patterns of co-occurrence among these taxa which could suggest they are functionally linked.</p>

<sec id="s2c"><title>Most heritable taxon varies by ethnicity</title>
<p>Identified as the most heritable human gut taxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), the family Christensenellaceae exhibits the second strongest significant differences in abundance across ethnicities in both AGP and HMP datasets (<bold>S5 Table</bold>, Family: AGP, Kruskal-Wallis, p<sub>FDR</sub>=1.55e-9; HMP, Kruskal-Wallis, p<sub>FDR</sub>=0.0019). Additionally, Christensenellaceae is variable by sex and BMI (AGP: Sex, Kruskal-Wallis, p<sub>FDR</sub>=1.22e-12; BMI, Kruskal-Wallis, p<sub>FDR</sub>=0.0020), and represents some of the strongest pairwise correlations with other taxa in both co-occurrence clusters (<bold>S2 Fig</bold>). There is at least an eight-fold and two-fold reduction in average Christensenellaceae abundance in Asian-Pacific Islanders relative to the other ethnicities in the AGP and HMP respectively (<bold>S5 Table</bold>), and significance of all pairwise comparisons in both datasets show reduced abundance in Asian-Pacific Islanders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). Abundance in individuals possessing Christensenellaceae and presence/absence across all individuals significantly associate with ethnicity (<bold>S6 Table</bold>, Abundance, Linear Regression, p<sub>Bonferroni</sub>=0.006; Presence/Absence, Logistic Regression, p<sub>Bonferroni</sub>=8.802e-6), but there was only a slight correlation between the taxon&#x2019;s relative abundance and BMI (<bold>S3 Fig</bold>). Confirming previous associations with lower BMI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we observe that AGP individuals with Christensenellaceae also have a significantly lower BMI (Mean BMI, 23.7&#x00B1;4.3) than individuals without it (Mean BMI, 25.0&#x00B1;5.9; Mann-Whitney-U, p&#x003C;0.001). This pattern is separately reflected in African Americans, Asian-Pacific Islanders, and Caucasians but not Hispanics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting that each ethnicity may have different equilibria between the taxon&#x2019;s abundance and body weight.</p>

<p>Many factors associate with human ethnicity, including a small subset of population specific genetic variants (estimated &#x223C;0.5&#x0025; genome wide) that vary by biogeographical ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), and self-declared ethnicity in the HMP is delineated by population genetic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Here we investigate whether ethnicity-associated taxa overlap with (i) taxa that have a significant population genetic heritability in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and (ii) taxa linked with human genetic variants in two large Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)-microbiota analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). All except one recurrent ethnicity-associated taxa are heritable in at least one study, with seven replicating in three or more studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Likewise, abundance variation in seven recurrent ethnicity-associated taxa demonstrate significant GWAS associations with at least one variant in the human genome, therefore we assess whether any genetic variants associated with differences in microbial abundance show significant rates of differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub>) between 1,000 genomes superpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Out of 49 variants associated with ethnically varying taxa, 21 have higher F<sub>ST</sub> values between at least one pair of populations than that of 95&#x0025; of other variants on the same chromosome and across the genome, and the F<sub>ST</sub> values of five variants associated with Clostridiaceae abundance rank above the top 99&#x0025; (<bold>S7 Table</bold>). Since taxa that vary across ethnicities exhibit lower abundance in Asian-Pacific Islanders, it is notable that the F<sub>ST</sub> values of 18 and 11 variant comparisons for East Asian and South Asian populations, respectively, are above that of the 95&#x0025; rate of differentiation threshold from African, American, or European populations. Critically, the microbiota and 1,000 genomes datasets are not drawn from the same individuals, and disentangling the role of genetic from social and environmental factors will still require more controlled studies.</p>

<sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many common diseases associate with microbiota composition and ethnicity, raising the central hypothesis that microbiota variation between ethnicities can occasionally serve as a mediator of health disparities. American&#x2019;s self-declared ethnicity can capture socioeconomic, cultural, geographic, dietary and genetic diversity, and a similarly complex array of interindividual and environmental factors influence total microbiota composition, resulting in challenges when trying to consistently recover variation in total gut microbiota between ethnicities. These challenges inform the importance of reproducibility, both through confirmation across analytical methods and replication across study populations. In order to more fully evaluate this hypothesis, baseline generalizations are drawn here about the impact of ethnicity on gut microbiota variation in healthy individuals, and is concordant with recent literature in single populations suggesting that ethnicity plays a subtle but reproducible role in microbiota assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether shaped through socioeconomic, dietary, healthcare, genetic, or other ethnicity-related factors, the replicated, varying taxa represent sources for novel hypotheses addressing health disparities. For instance, the family Odoribacteraceae and genus <italic>Odoribacter</italic> are primary butyrate producers in the gut, and have been negatively linked to severe forms of Crohn&#x2019;s disease and Ulcerative Colitis in association with reduced butyrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Asian-Pacific Islanders possess significantly less Odoribacteraceae and <italic>Odoribacter</italic> than Hispanics and Caucasians in both datasets, and severity of Ulcerative Colitis upon hospital admission has been shown to be significantly higher in Asian Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Considering broader physiological roles, several ethnicity-associated taxa are primary gut anaerobic fermenters and methanogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and associate with lower BMI and blood triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Indeed, Christensenellaceae, Odoribacteraceae, <italic>Odoribacter</italic>, and the class Mollicutes containing RF39 negatively associate with metabolic syndrome and demonstrate significant population heritability in twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Implications for health outcomes warrant further investigation, but could be reflected by positive correlations of Odoribacteraceae, <italic>Odoribacter</italic>, Coriobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, and the dominant Verrucomicrobiaceae lineage <italic>Akkermansia</italic> with old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Moreover, these findings raise the importance of controlling for ethnicity in studies linking microbiota variation to disease because associations between specific microbes and a disease could be confounded by ethnicity of the study subjects.</p>
<p>Based on correlations in individual taxon&#x2019;s abundance, a similar pattern of cooccurrence previously identified as the Christensenellaceae &#x2018;consortium&#x2019; includes 11 of the 12 recurrent ethnically varying taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and members of this consortium associate with genetic variation in the human formate oxidation gene<italic>ALDH1L1</italic> which is a genetic risk factor for stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Formate metabolism is a key step in the pathway reducing carbon dioxide to methane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and increased methane associates with increased Rikenellaceae, Christensenellaceae, Odoribacteraceae and <italic>Odoribacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Products of methanogenic fermentation pathways include short chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which through reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been linked to cancer cell apoptosis and reduced risk of colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Asian Americans are the only ethnic group where cancer surpasses heart disease as the leading cause of death, and over 70&#x0025; of Asian Americans were born overseas, which can affect assimilation into western lifestyles, leading to reduced access to healthcare and screening, and proper medical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Indeed, as countries in Asia shift toward a more western lifestyle, the incidence of cancers, particularly gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers, are increasing rapidly, possibly indicating incompatibilities between traditionally harbored microbiota and western lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Asian Americans have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and pathogenic infections than Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), and two metagenomic functions enriched in control versus type 2 diabetes cases appear to be largely conferred by cluster-associated butyrate-producing and motility-inducing Verrucomicrobiaceae and Clostridia lineages reduced in abundance among AGP and HMP Asian-Pacific Islanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Both induction of cell motility and butyrate promotion of mucin integrity can protect against pathogenic colonization and associate with microbial community changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Levels of cell motility and butyrate are key factors suspected to underlie a range of health disparities including inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Patterns of ethnically varying taxa across ethnicities could result from many factors including varying diets, environmental exposures, sociocultural influences, human genetic variation and others. However, regardless of the mechanisms dictating assembly, these results suggest there is a reproducible, co-occurring group of taxa linked by similar metabolic processes known to promote homeostasis.</p>
<p>The utility of this work is establishing a framework for studying ethnicity-associated taxa and hypotheses of how changes in abundance or presence of these taxa may or may not shape health disparities, many of which also have genetic components. Differing in allele frequency across three population comparisons and associated with the abundance of Clostridiales, the genetic variant rs7587067 has a significantly higher frequency in African (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)=0.802) versus East Asian (MAF=0.190, F<sub>ST</sub>=0.54, Chromosome=98.7&#x0025;, Genome-Wide=98.9&#x0025;), admixed American (MAF=0.278, F<sub>ST</sub>=0.44, Chromosome=99.0&#x0025;, Genome-Wide=99.1&#x0025;), and European populations (MAF=0.267, F<sub>ST</sub>=0.45, Chromosome=98.7.3&#x0025;, Genome-Wide=98.7&#x0025;). This intronic variant for the gene <italic>HECW2</italic> is a known eQTL (GTeX, eQTL Effect Size=-0.18, p=7.4e-5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), and <italic>HECW2</italic> encodes a ubiquitin ligase linked to enteric gastrointestinal nervous system function through maintenance of endothelial lining of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Knockout of <italic>HECW2</italic> in mice reduced enteric neuron networks and gut motility, and patients with Hirschsprung&#x2019;s disease have diminished localization of <italic>HECW2</italic> to regions affected by loss of neurons and colon blockage when compared to other regions of their own colon and healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Hirschsprung&#x2019;s disease presenting as full colon blockage is rare and has not undergone targeted examination as a health disparity, however a possible hypothesis is that lower penetrance of the disease in individuals with the risk allele at rs7587067 could lead to subtler effects on gut motility resulting in Clostridiales abundance variation.</p>
<p>Another example is that the abundance of Rikenellaceae in the gut is strongly and reproducibly associated with variant rs62171178, which was identified as an eQTL for gene <italic>PHOSPHO2</italic> within human gut tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). The primary substrate of the protein encoded by <italic>PHOSPHO2</italic> is vitamin B6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), which shows increased deficiencies in germ free compared to conventionally reared rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). Interestingly, microbial vitamin B6 biosynthesis and salvage was the best predictor of chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Despite the intrigue of connecting the human genome, microbiota and disease phenotypes, evaluating these hypotheses will require more holistic approaches such as incorporating metagenomics and metabolomics to identify whether enzymes or metabolic functions reproducibly vary across ethnicities, as well as direct functional studies in model systems to understand if correlation is truly driven by causation.</p>
<p>Further limitations should also be considered, including recruitment biases for the AGP versus HMP, variation in sample processing and OTU clustering, and uneven sampling which could only be addressed with down sampling of over-represented ethnicities. Still, despite these confounders care was taken to demonstrate the reproducibility of results across statistical methods, ecological metrics, rarefaction depths, and study populations. Summarily, this work suggests that abundance variation of specific taxa, rather than whole communities, may represent the most reliable ethnic signatures in the gut microbiota. A reproducible co-occurring subset of these taxa link to a variety of overlapping metabolic processes and health disparities, and contain the most heritable bacterial family, Christensenellaceae. Moreover, a majority of the microbial taxa associated with ethnicity are also heritable and genetically-associated lineages, suggesting there is a possible connection between ethnicity and genetic patterns of biogeographical ancestry that may play a role in shaping these taxa. Our results emphasize the importance of sampling ethnically diverse populations of healthy individuals in order to discover and replicate ethnicity signatures in the human gut microbiota, and they highlight a need to account for ethnic variation as a potential confounding factor in studies linking microbiota variation to disease. Further reinforcement of these results may lead to generalizations about microbiota assembly and even consideration of specific taxa as potential mediators or treatments of health disparities.</p>

<p>AGP data was obtained from the project FTP repository located at <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.microbio.me/AmericanGut/">ftp://ftp.microbio.me/AmericanGut/</ext-link></italic>. AGP data generation and processing prior to analysis can be found at: <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://https://github.com/biocore/American-Gut/tree/master/ipynb/primary-processing">https://github.com/biocore/American-Gut/tree/master/ipynb/primary-processing</ext-link></italic>. All analyses utilized the rounds-1-25 dataset which was released on March 4, 2016. Throughout all analyses, QIIME v1.9.0 was used in an Anaconda environment [<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://https://continuum.io">https://continuum.io</ext-link></italic>] for all script calls, custom scripts and notebooks were run in the QIIME 2 Anaconda environment with python version 3.5.2, and plots were post-processed using Inkscape [<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://https://inkscape.org/en/">https://inkscape.org/en/</ext-link></italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Ethnicity used in this studywas self-declared by AGP study participants as one of four groups: African American, Asian or Pacific Islander (Asian-Pacific Islander), Caucasian, or Hispanic. Sex was self-declared as either male, female, or other. Age was self-declared as a continuous integer of years old, and age categories defined by the AGP by decade (i.e. 20&#x2019;s, 30&#x2019;s&#x2026;) were used in this study. BMI was self-declared as an integer, and BMI categories defined by AGP of underweight, healthy, overweight, and obese were utilized. Microbiota communities were characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing of variable region four and OTU clustering at 97&#x0025; similarity, following an identical processing pipeline for all samples developed and optimized for the Earth Microbiome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). HMP 16S rDNA data processed using QIIME for variable regions 3-5 was obtained from <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmpdacc.org/HMQCP/">http://hmpdacc.org/HMQCP/</ext-link></italic>. Demographic info for individual HMP participants was obtained through dbGaP restricted access to study phs000228.v2.p1, with dbGaP approval granted to SRB and non-human subjects determination IRB161231 granted by Vanderbilt University. Ethnicity and sex were assigned to subjects based on self-declared values, with individuals selecting multiple ethnicities being removed unless they primarily responded as Hispanic, while categorical age and BMI were established from continuous values using the same criteria for assignment as in AGP. The HMP Amerindian population was removed due to severe under-representation. This filtered HMP table was used for community level analyses (ANOSIM, Alpha Diversity, beta intra-inter), however to allow comparison with the AGP dataset, community subset analyses (co-occurrence, abundance correlation, etc&#x2026;) were performed with taxonomic assignments in QIIME using the UCLUST method with the GreenGenes_13_5 reference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b"><title>Quality Control</title>
<p>AGP quality control was performed in Stata v12 (StataCorp, 2011) using available metadata to remove samples (Raw N=9,475): with BMI more than 60 (&#x2212;988 [8,487]) or less than 10 (&#x2212;68 [8,419]), missing age (&#x2212;661 [7,758]), with age greater than 55 years old (&#x2212;2,777 [4,981]) or less than 18 years old (&#x2212;582 [4,399]), and blank samples or those not appearing in the mapping file (&#x2212;482 [3,917]), with unknown ethnicity or declared as other (&#x2212;131 [3786]), not declared as a fecal origin (&#x2212;2,002 [1784]), with unknown sex or declared as other (&#x2212;98 [1686]), or located outside of the United States (&#x2212;209 [1477]). No HMP individuals were missing key metadata or had other reasons for exclusion (&#x2212;0[298]). Final community quality control for both AGP and HMP was performed by filtering OTUs with less than 10 sequences and removing samples with less than 1,000 sequences (AGP, &#x2212;102 [1375]; HMP, &#x2212;0 [298]). All analyses used 97&#x0025; OTUs generated by the AGP or HMP, and unless otherwise noted, results represent Bray-Curtis beta diversity and Shannon alpha diversity at a rarefaction depth of 1,000 counts per sample.</p>

<sec id="s4c"><title>ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and BioEnv Distinguishability</title>
<p>The ANOSIM test was performed with 9,999 repetitions on each rarefied table within a respective rarefaction depth and beta diversity metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref> &#x0026; <bold>S2A-B Table</bold>), with R-values and p-values averaged across the rarefactions. Consensus beta diversity matrices were calculated as the average distances across the 100 rarefied matrices for each beta diversity metric and depth. Consensus distance matrices were randomly subsampled ten times for subset number of individuals from each ethnic group with more than that subset number prior to ANOSIM analysis with 9,999 repetitions, and the results were averaged evaluating the effects of more even representations for each ethnicity (<bold>S2C Table</bold>). Consensus distance matrices had each ethnicity and pair of ethnicities removed prior to ANOSIM analysis with 9,999 repetitions, evaluating the distinguishability conferred by inclusion of each ethnicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>, <bold>S2F Table</bold>). Significance was not corrected for the number of tests to allow comparisons between results of different analyses, metrics, and depths. PERMANOVA analyses were run using the R language implementation in the Vegan package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), with data handled in a custom R script using the Phyloseq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Categorical variables were used to evaluate the PERMANOVA equation (Beta-Diversity Distance Matrix &#x223C; Ethnicity &#x002B; Age &#x002B; Sex &#x002B; BMI) using 999 permutations to evaluate significance, and the R and p values were averaged across 10 rarefactions (<bold>S2D Table</bold>). The BioEnv test, or BEST test, was adapted to allow evaluation of the correlation and significance between beta diversity distance matrices and age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity simultaneously (<bold>S2E Table</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). At each rarefaction depth and beta diversity metric the consensus distance matrix was evaluated for its correlation with the centered and scaled Euclidian distance matrix of individuals continuous age and BMI, and categorical ethnicity and sex encoded using patsy (same methodology as original test)[<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#">https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#</ext-link></italic>]. The test was adapted to calculate significance for a variable of interest by comparing how often the degree of correlation with all metadata variables (age, sex, BMI, ethnicity) was higher than the correlation when the variable of interest was randomly shuffled between samples 1,000 times.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d"><title>Alpha Diversity</title>
<p>Alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Equitability, Chao1, Observed OTUs) were computed for each rarefied table (QIIME: alpha_diversity.py), and results were collated and averaged for each sample across the tables (QIIME: collate_alpha.py). Pairwise nonparametric t-tests using Monte Carlo permutations evaluated alpha diversity differences between the ethnicities with Bonferroni correction for the number of comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>, <bold>S3 Table</bold>, QIIME: compare_alpha_diversity.py). A Kruskal-Wallis test implemented in python was used to detect significant differences across all ethnicities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e"><title>Beta Diversity</title>
<p>Each consensus beta diversity distance matrix had distances organized based on whether they represented individuals of the same ethnic group, or were between individuals of different ethnic groups. All values indicate that all pairwise distances between all individuals were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>, <bold>S4A-B Table</bold>), mean values indicate that for each individual their average distance to all individuals in the comparison group was used as a single point to assess pseudo-inflation (<bold>S4C-D Table</bold>). A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to calculate significant differences in intra-ethnic distances across all ethnicities. Pairwise Mann-Whitney-U tests were calculated between each pair of intra-ethnic distance comparisons, along with intra-versus-inter ethnic distance comparisons. Significance was Bonferroni corrected within the number of intra-intra-ethnic and intra-inter-ethnic distance groups compared, with violin plots of intra- and inter-ethnic beta diversity distances generated for each comparison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f"><title>Random Forest</title>
<p>RF models were implemented using taxa summarized at genus level, which performed better compared to RF models using OTUs as features, both in terms of classification accuracy and computational time. We first rarefied OTU tables at sequence depth of 10,000 (using R v3.3.3 package <italic>vegan&#x2019;s</italic> rrarefy() function) and then summarized rarefied OTUs at genus-level (or lower characterized level if genus was uncharacterized for an OTU). We filtered for rare taxa by removing taxa present in fewer than half of the number of samples in rarest ethnicity (i.e. fewer than 10/2 = 5 samples in HMP and 13/2 = 6 (rounded down) in AGP), retaining 85 distinct taxa in HMP dataset and 322 distinct taxa in AGP dataset at genus level. The resulting taxa were normalized to relative abundance and arcsin-sqrt transformed before being used as features for the RF models. We initially built multi-class RF model, but since the RF model is highly sensitive to the uneven representation of classes, all samples were identified as the majority class, i.e. Caucasian. In order to even out the class imbalance, we considered some sampling approaches, but most existing techniques for improving classification performance on imbalanced datasets are designed for binary class imbalanced datasets, and are not effective on datasets with multiple underrepresented classes. Hence, we adopted the binary classification approach and built four one-versus-all (OVA) binary RF classifiers to classify samples from each ethnicity compared to the rest. 10-fold cross-validation (using R package <italic>caret</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>)) was performed using ROC as the metric for selecting optimal model. The performance metrics and ROC curves were averaged across the 10 folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>). Without any sampling during training the classifiers, most samples were identified as the majority class, i.e. the Caucasian, by all four OVA RF classifiers. In order to overcome this imbalance in class representation, we applied two sampling techniques inside cross-validation: i) down-sampling, and ii) Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (or SMOTE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In the down-sampling approach, the majority class is down-sampled by random removal of instances from the majority class. In the SMOTE approach, the majority class is down-sampled and synthetic samples from the minority class are generated based on k-nearest neighbors technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Note, the sampling was performed inside cross-validation on training set, while the test was performed on unbalanced held-out test set in each fold. The ROC curves and performance metrics table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref> show the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff and classification performance for OVA classifier for each ethnicity for both the sampling techniques applied on both the datasets. For both the datasets, down-sampling shows higher sensitivity and lower specificity and precision for minority classes (i.e. African Americans, Asian-Pacific Islanders and Hispanics) compared to SMOTE. However, for the majority class (i.e. Caucasian), down-sampling lowers the sensitivity and increases the specificity and precision compared to SMOTE. The sensitivity-specificity tradeoff, denoted by the area under the ROC curve (or AUC) is reduced for Hispanics in both the datasets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g"><title>Taxon Associations</title>
<p>Taxon differential abundance across categorical metadata groups was performed in QIIME (QIIME: group_significance.py, <bold>S5 Table</bold>) to examine whether observation counts (i.e. OTUs and microbial taxon) are significantly different between groups within a metadata category (i.e. ethnicity, sex, BMI, age). The OTU table prior to final community quality control was collapsed at each taxonomic level (i.e. Phylum &#x2013; Genus; QIIME: collapse_taxonomy.py), with counts representing the relative abundance of each microbial taxon. Differences in the mean abundance of taxa between ethnicities were calculated using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric statistical tests. P-values are provided alongside false discovery rate and Bonferroni corrected P-values, and taxon were ranked from most to least significant. Results were collated into excel tables by taxonomic level and metadata category being examined, with significant (false discovery rate and Bonferroni P-value &#x003C; 0.05) highlighted in orange, and taxa that were false discovery rate significant in both datasets were colored red. The Fisher&#x2019;s exact test for the overlap of number of significant taxa between datasets was run at the online portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vassarstats.net/tab2&#x00D7;2.html">http://vassarstats.net/tab2&#x00D7;2.html</ext-link>), with the expected overlap calculated as 5&#x0025; of the number of significant lineages at all taxonomic level within the respective dataset, and the observed 25 taxa that overlapped in our analysis. The permutation analysis was performed by comparing the number of significant taxa (<bold>S5 Table</bold>, p<sub>FDR</sub>&#x003C;0.05) overlapping between the AGP and HMP to the number overlapping when the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed 1,000 times with ethnicity randomly permuted. In 1/1000 runs there was one significant taxon overlapping at the family level, and one in 3/1000 permutations at the genus level, with no significant taxa overlapping in any repetitions at higher taxonomic levels. The 12 families and genera that were significantly different were evaluated to not be &#x2018;unique&#x2019; if their abundances across ethnicities at each level represented at least 82-100&#x0025; (nearly all &#x003E;95&#x0025;) of the overlapping taxonomic level, and the genera was used if classified, and family level used if genera was unclassified (g__). Average relative abundances on a log10 scale among individuals possessing the taxon were extracted for each taxon within each ethnicity, and the abundance for 12 families and genera were made into barchart figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). The external whisker (AGP above, HMP below) depict the 75<sup>th</sup> quartile of abundance, and the internal whisker depicts the 25<sup>th</sup> quartile. Pairwise Mann-Whitney-U tests were performed between each pair of ethnicities using microbial abundances among all individuals, and were Bonferroni corrected for the six comparisons within each taxon and dataset. Bonferroni significant P-values are shown in the figure, and shown in bold if significance and direction of change replicate in both datasets. Ubiquity shown above or below each bar was calculated as the number of individuals in which that taxon was detected within the respective ethnicity. Additional confirmation of ethnically varying abundance was also performed at each taxonomic level (<bold>S6 Table</bold>), where the correlation of continuous age and BMI along with categorically coded sex and ethnicity were simultaneously measured against the log 10 transformed relative abundance of each taxon among individuals possessing it using linear regression (<bold>S6 Table</bold> - Abundance), and against the presence or absence of the taxon in all individuals with logistic regression (<bold>S6 Table</bold> - Presence Absence). Significance is presented for the models each with ethnicity alone, and with all metadata factors included (age, sex, BMI), alongside Bonferroni corrected p-values, and individual effects of each metadata factor.</p>
<sec id="s4g1"><title>Co-Occurrence Analysis</title>
<p>Bacterial taxonomy was collapsed at the family level, Spearman correlation was calculated between each pair of families using SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), and clustermaps were generated using seaborn (<bold>S2 Fig</bold>), and ethnic associations were drawn from <bold>S5 Table</bold>. Correlations were masked where Bonferroni corrected Spearman p-values were &#x003E;0.05, and clusters were identified as the most prominent (strongest correlations) and abundance enriched. Enrichment of ethnic association was evaluated by measuring the Mann-Whitney-U of cluster families ethnic associations (p-values, <bold>S5 Table</bold>) compared to the ethnic associations of non-cluster taxa. Cluster associated families were identified as having at least three significant correlations with families within the cluster.</p>

<sec id="s4g2"><title>Christensenellaceae Analysis</title>
<p>The abundance of the family Christensenellaceae was input as relative abundance across all individuals from the family level taxonomic table. Individuals were subset based on the presence/absence of Christensenellaceae and BMIs were compared using a one tailed Mann-Whitney-U test, then each was further subset by ethnicity and BMI compared using one tailed Mann-Whitney-U tests and boxplots within each ethnicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4g3"><title>Genetically Associated, Heritable, and Correlated Taxa Analysis</title>
<p>Genetically associated taxa from population heritability studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) with a minimum heritability (A in ACE models or H2r) &#x003E;0.1, and from GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) were examined for exact taxonomic overlap with our 12 ethnically-associated taxa. The 42 genetic variants associated with Unclassified Clostridiales are: rs16845116, rs586749, rs7527642, rs10221827, rs5754822, rs4968435, rs17170765, rs1760889, rs6933411, rs2830259, rs7318523, rs17763551, rs2248020, rs1278911, rs185902, rs2505338, rs6999713, rs5997791, rs7236263, rs10484857, rs9938742, rs1125819, rs4699323, rs641527, rs7302174, rs2007084, rs2293702, rs9350764, rs2170226, rs2273623, rs9321334, rs6542797, rs9397927, rs2269706, rs4717021, rs7499858, rs10148020, rs7524581, rs11733214, rs7587067 from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). These 40 variants along with variants in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> except for chr7:96414393 (total=49) were then assessed in 1,000 Genomes individuals for significant differentiation across superpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The 1,000 Genomes VCF files were downloaded (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/</ext-link>), and variants with a minor allele frequency less than 0.01 were removed with F<sub>ST</sub> calculated between each pair of superpopulations using vcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). The East Asian versus South Asian F<sub>ST</sub> rates were not used in the analysis. A custom script was used to examine the FST for each of the 49 variants and compare to the F<sub>ST</sub> of all variants on the same chromosome and all variants genome-wide for that pair of populations, with percentile calculated and the number of variants with a higher F<sub>ST</sub> divided by the total number of variants. The eQTL value and significance for rs7587067 were drawn from the GTEx database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>).</p>
