<title>Summary</title>
<p>Broadly neutralizing antibodies (Abs) that bind the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stem may enable universal influenza vaccination. Here, we show that anti-stem Abs sterically inhibit viral neuraminidase activity against large substrates, with activity inversely proportional to the length of the fibrous NA stalk that supports the enzymatic domain. By modulating NA stalk length in recombinant IAVs, we show that anti-stem Abs inhibit virus release from infected cells by blocking NA, accounting for their <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization activity. NA inhibition contributes to anti-stem Ab protection in influenza infected mice, likely due at least in part to NA-mediated inhibition of Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R dependent activation of innate immune cells by antibody bound to virions. FDA approved NA inhibitors enhance anti-stem based Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic> dependent immune cell activation, raising the possibility of therapeutic synergy between NA inhibitors and anti-stem mAb treatment in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The severe 2017-18 influenza season provides a timely if unwelcome reminder of the limitations of current vaccines in coping with antigenic drift in the viral surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA mediates viral attachment to cell surface sialic acid residues and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. NA releases nascent virus from infected cells by removing terminal sialic residues from glycoproteins and glycolipids.</p>
<p>Current vaccines induce antibodies (Abs) specific for the HA head. Head-binding antibodies neutralize IAV infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> by blocking virus attachment, and depending on the epitope recognized, by preventing the conformational alterations needed to trigger membrane fusion. Due to the immunodominance of the HA head following infection and standard vaccination, Ab responses drive rapid evolution in the head that enables viral escape. In contrast to the HA head, the stem domain is highly conserved and cross-reactive between strains within the same group. Early proof-of principle studies find that a stem-specific mAb could block HA mediated fusion, neutralize IAV and protect against IAV disease in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Okuno et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Okuno et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Russ et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Styk et al., 1979</xref>). Further studies from many labs indicate that broadly neutralizing (BN) stem-specific Abs are common in humans and can be induced by standard vaccination protocols, albeit at low levels relative to head-specific Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chiu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Corti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Henry Dunand and Wilson, 2015</xref>). Much more robust BN stem-specific responses can be elicited by native stem only immunogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Impagliazzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mallajosyula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yassine et al., 2015</xref>) or a prime-boost head-stem chimeric HA molecule strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Krammer et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Ab-driven antigenic drift in the stem may ultimately limit stem-based vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Doud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lees et al., 2014</xref>), as a promising &#x201C;universal&#x201D; vaccine strategy it is critical to understand the mechanism(s) of anti-stem Abs in reducing/preventing IAV disease in humans. Stem binding Ab have been reported to block viral entry into cells by preventing the acid-induced conformations alterations in HA required to catalyze viral-cell membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Vareckova et al., 2003</xref>), and to prevent release from infected cells, through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yamayoshi et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, anti-stem Abs may largely exert protection via Fc mediated activation of humoral and cellular innate immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">DiLillo et al., 2014a</xref>)</p>
<p>HA is typically present on virions at more than 5-fold higher molar amounts than NA. Abs specific for the HA globular as well as for stem domain can sterically interfere with NA activity against large protein substrates as long as virus remains intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kosik and Yewdell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rajendran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Russ et al., 1974</xref>), suggesting a possible mechanism for stem-Ab mediated inhibition of viral release from infected cells. Here we show that NA inhibition can be a major contributor of BN activity of stem-specific Abs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the latter case likely by interfering with Fc-receptor activated innate immune cell anti-viral effector activity.</p>

<title>BN HA stem specific mAbs inhibit viral neuraminidase</title>
<p>The commonly used ELLA method for measuring Ab-mediated NA inhibition (NAI) is complicated by blockade of viral access to the plate-bound substrate by anti-HA head Abs that block viral attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kosik and Yewdell, 2017</xref>). This does not, however, apply to stem-binding Abs which do not block virus attachment even at saturating concentrations (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Anti-stem mAbs 310-16G8 and 310-18F8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Whittle et al., 2014</xref>) efficiently inhibit N1 or N2 NAs using viruses with H1 HA stems (PR/8/34 (H1N1), Cal/4/09 (H1N1), chimeric cH5/1N2 (H5headH1 stem N2)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Similarly, we found that the CR8020 mAb that binds H3 HA (group 2) stems could block N2 NA in several H3N2 strains, and for FI6, also N1 in PR8, demonstrating that NAI can be mediated by a group I/II cross-reactive stem-specific Ab (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We measured the capacity of purified anti-stem mAbs on NA activity via ELLA against the viruses indicated. ELLA is based on NA removal of terminal sialic acids from plate bound fetuin, which is assessed by binding of a lectin for the exposed penultimate galactose. mAbs used are specific for either group 1 (G1), group 2 (G2) HA stems, or bind both groups (G1/2). We normalized data by NA activity in the absence of the Ab (set to 100&#x0025;). Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples acquired in three independent experiments.</p></caption>

<title>Neuraminidase inhibition of stem specific Abs is inversely related to NA stalk length</title>
<p>Curiously, the chimeric H5/1N2 virus exhibits 2-3 fold increased resistance to stem mAb-mediated NAI compared to PR8, despite sharing the identical stem sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>). Sequence alignment of the relevant N1 and N2 NAs revealed a 15-amino acid extension in the N2 NA stalk region (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>), suggesting that NA stalk length may influence the NAI activity of anti-stem Abs. The NA stalk exhibits natural length variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2011</xref>) and its modulation is frequently associated with host adaptation and pathogenicity changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Matsuoka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the influence of NA stalk length on anti-stem Ab function, we generated recombinant PR8 viruses with NAs lacking a stalk (del24) or with a 20-residue insertion (ins20) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Despite no obvious differences in the morphology of purified virions by cryoEm (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>), immunoblotting for NA confirmed the expected alteration in M<sub>r</sub> in SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). Using two independently generated recombinant virus preps we found that wt, del24 and ins20 purified virions contained similar amounts of NA and HA by quantitative immunoblotting (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). Kinetic analysis of NA activity in purified viruses using the small fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>) revealed that adding or deleting stalk amino acids had minor effects on NA V<sub>max</sub> or Km. By contrast, lengthening the stem greatly accelerated NA-mediated release from RBCs while shortening the stem retarded release (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>), confirming previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chockalingam et al., 2012</xref>). While ins20 and del24 exhibit altered release from RBCs compared to wt, all the viruses replicated with similar kinetics in MDCK SIAT1 cells, consistent with similar replication also <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>). We next examined HA stem-Ab mediated NAI using the stalk mutants.</p>
<p>Using ELISA, we established that NA stalk length does not affect the binding of anti-HA stem mAbs 310-16G8 and 310-18F8 to plate-bound purified virus (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref> upper panels). Similarly, flow cytometry revealed that the NA stalk does not affect stem Ab binding to HA on infected MDCK cells (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Despite this, shortening the NA stalk increased the NAI activity of the same mAbs by &#x223C;4-fold relative to wt virus while lengthening the stalk had the oppositeeffect, resulting in a 10-20-fold difference in NAI titers in ins20 vs. del24 viruses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>NA inhibition contributes to virus-neutralizing activity of stem-specific Abs by inhibiting release</title>
<p>Our findings predict that stem-binding Abs should neutralize viral infectivity by inhibiting NA-mediated release from infected cells. To test this prediction, we examined the effect of NA stalk length on mAb neutralization. For this, we generated a panel of reporter viruses that express mCherry, enabling precise flow cytometric enumeration of virus-infected cells. We added virus preincubated with mAbs at 37&#x00B0;C to MDCK SIAT1 cells and measured frequency of IAV infected cells 4 h post infection (p.i.). IC5-4F8, a control mAb specific for the Sb antigenic site in the head domainof H1 neutralized viruses equally regardless of NA stalk (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Neutralization by two stem-specific Abs was much less efficient (even when factoring in Ab avidity) but did not vary with NA stalk length after single replication cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, when infection time was extended by 14 h to enable multicycle infection both stem specific mAbs demonstrated a &#x223C; 100-fold increase in neutralization against del24 relative to wt or ins20 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This effect was stem-specific, as it was not observed with IC5-4F8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>A simple explanation for the NA-specific effect by anti-stem Abs in multistep neutralization of del24 is that anti-stem Abs block virus release, retarding cell to cell transmission. We therefore added mAbs 4 h after infecting MDCK-SIAT1 cells with wt, del24 or ins20 PR8, and measured NA activity of virus released into the media from cells over the next 6 h using NA activity with MUNANA as a proxy. We confirmed that mAbs did not alter the infection <italic>per se</italic> by quantitating intracellular NP and NA in fixed and permeabilized cells by indirect immunoassay (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Both stem mAbs tested blocked release of each virus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). By contrast, the HA head-specific mAb-IC5-4F8 as expected (or a control mAb specific for an irrelevant Ag) did not block virus release (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Importantly, both stem mAbs tested exhibited greatly enhanced effects on del24 release from cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), providing an explanation for the enhanced activity of anti-HA stem Abs in the multicycle neutralization assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>NA stalk length controls effectiveness of HA stem specific Abs in limiting IAV pathogenesis</title>
<p>Extending these findings to an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of IAV pathogenesis, we passively transferred stem or head specific mAbs into C57Bl/6 mice, 4 h later challenged with pathogenically equal high doses of wt or NA stalk variant viruses and monitored weight loss. Following infection without transferred Ab, 100&#x0025; of mice were humanely sacrificed between d 4 and 7 p.i. when they reached &#x003E;30&#x0025; weight loss. As expected, mice receiving the HA head-specific mAb IC5-4F8 were efficiently protected against each virus, with minimal weight loss and 100&#x0025; survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Surprisingly, in mice passively administered 310-16G8, infection with either wt or del24 resulted in delayed and attenuated weight loss and all mice recovered from by 10 d p.i. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In contrast, mice infected with ins20 receiving 310-16G8 lost weight with similar kinetics as control, PBS administered mice, with only 17&#x0025; of ins20-infected mice recovering (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Higher doses of wt virus resulted in more rapid weight loss and 100&#x0025; mortality in 310-168-treated mice infected with wt virus, but 80&#x0025; protection and recovery by day 13 in del24-infected Ab-treated mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

The only statistically significant difference in histopathological scoring was a decreased immune cell infiltration in alveoli of del24-infected mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), clearly shown in the insets. Fluorescent immunostaining of the IAV NP in 310-16G8 treated mice mirrors alveolar histopathological burden with decreased frequency of NP positive cells in particular for del24 infected mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). It is clear, that NA stem length, and therefore NA activity against sterically-susceptible substrates, can greatly affect the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of anti-HA stem Abs, decreasing alveolar damage in parallel with reducing virus infected alveolar cells.</p>

<title>NA Inhibits Fc receptor based innate cell activation</title>
<p>Despite the clear virus neutralizing activity of anti-HA stem Abs <italic>in vitro</italic>, several studies indicate that their protective effect in mice depends on their interaction with Fc <italic>&#x03B3;</italic> receptors (Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R), implicating the required participation of Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R bearing innate immune cells (NK cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and others) or/and complement. HA-stem specific Abs are known to activate cells via Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R interaction in a process that requires HA binding to SA residues on the Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R expressing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DiLillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dilillo et al., 2014b</xref>), since it is blocked by head-specific mAbs that block virus attachment.</p>
<p>We could confirm these findings using Jurkat reporter cells engineered to express luciferase after engagement of Ab-Ag complexes with the Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>RIIIa receptor expressed from a transgene (Jurkat cells are human T cell leukemia that do not naturally express Fc receptors or other NK activating receptors). Reporter cells were activated in a viral infection and stem Ab dependent manner. The addition of IC5-4F8, which binds non-competitively with stem Abs in close proximity to the HA receptor binding site, completely blocked activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>Having established a robust system for measuring stem-Ab based Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R coupled innate cell activation we next examined whether the anti-NA activity of stem-specific Abs enhances activation. After incubating reporter cells overnight with virus-Ab mixtures, cellular activation was enhanced implicating NA-based 2-fold by del24 relative to wt or ins20 virus, inhibition of Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R-based activation. Consistent with this observation, adding FDA approved NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) increased reporter cell activation in all circumstances (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> top panel). The greatest enhancement was observed with wt and ins20 virusesin the presence of NA inhibitors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Curiously, despite what should be complete NA inhibition with the drugs, activation remained less than observed with del24, or del24 &#x002B; NA inhibitors, which achieved maximal activation. NA inhibitors also enhanced anti HA-stem Ab-dependent innate cell activation by MDCK SIAT1 cells infected with wt or and NA stalk variant viruses. Interestingly however, NA stalk length did not modulate activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> bottom panel).</p>
<p>Our interpretation of these data are that first, virus or cell surface NA interferes with Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R-based cell activation by cleaving SA on reporter cells, which can be blocked with NA inhibitors. Secondly, stem Ab-based steric effects on NA inhibition are far less sensitive on infected cells <italic>vs.</italic> virus, probably due to the relaxed organization of HA and NA spikes on the cell surface relative to the highly organized geometry on virions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HA stem-specific Abs are perhaps the most promising approach for improving the duration and effectiveness of influenza vaccination. It is therefore important to better understand how anti-stem Abs provide <italic>in vivo</italic> protection. Evidence from mouse passive Ab transfer studies indicates a critical role for Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>Rs in protection at lower (i.e. more physiological) stem Ab concentrations, implicating innate cell mechanisms. These could include NK cell mediated killing of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bar-On et al., 2013</xref>), macrophage clearance of virus, and cytokine/chemokine secretion by any of the many type of Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R expressing cells.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate a potentially critical role for NA in the anti-viral activity of HA specific Abs. By modulating the anti-NA effect of stem Ab using NA stalk deleted and extended viruses, we could show that stem binding Abs inhibit NA activity against large substrates, thereby blocking nascent virus release from infected cells. This phenomenon was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yamayoshi et al., 2017</xref>), however the mechanism has not been defined.</p>
<p>Our findings have interesting implications for the organization of glycoproteins on the virion surface. We unequivocally demonstrate that anti-stem Ab have sufficient access to HA on intact virions to inhibit NA activity, extending cryoelectron microscopy-based observations that Abs can access HA stem on intact virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wasilewski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). Examination of the Ab NAI titration curves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) reveals several intriguing features.</p>
<p>First, in agreement with Rajendran et al., at anti-stem Ab saturation &#x223C; 25&#x0025; of NA activity remains. This suggests that this fraction of NA is sufficiently physically segregated from HA on virions to prevent steric inhibition from neighboring HA. Decreasing stalk length reduces the resistant fraction by &#x223C;50&#x0025;. As NA is generally present in clusters on the virion surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Calder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wasilewski et al., 2012</xref>), the resistant fraction may represent NA on the interior of clusters of 4 or more molecules. If shortening stalk length decreased cluster size, this could account for the decreased resistant fraction.</p>
<p>Second, as NA stalk length increases, the amount of anti-stem Ab needed to block NA activity increases up to 20-fold, despite stalk length having no apparent effect on anti-HA binding to virions. As the Ab concentration increases, monovalent interactions will be favored, perhaps enabling more Abs bound per NA cluster, thus increasing the reach of stem-bound Abs.</p>
<p>In as much as the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of stem-binding Abs is based on Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DiLillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dilillo et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mullarkey et al., 2016</xref>), such activities would not be expected to contribute to Ab based protection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this conclusion, we only detected up to three-fold decrease in viral replication in stem Ab treated mice, despite a clear protective effect. While <italic>in vivo</italic> viral replication was shown correlate with stem-Ab dose, protection was also reported at low doses. In such a case viral replication can be reduced less than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dilillo et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kallewaard et al., 2016</xref>) while still completely protecting against mortality.</p>
<p>Remarkably, extending the NA stalk greatly reduced the protective effect of anti-HA stem mAbs, strongly implicating NA inhibition in Ab-mediated protection in our experimental system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Conversely, shortening the NA stalk reduced immune alveolar inflammation and lymphocyte infiltration, and increased protection at high virus doses. These effects are likely due to modulating NA activity. Indeed, we show that NA inhibits Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R reporter cell activation as clearly revealed by the enhancing effect of small molecule NA inhibitors.</p>
<p>NA inhibition of Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R expressing cells is consistent with the finding that anti-HA head-specific Abs block NK cell ADCC killing while NA-specific Abs enhance it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He et al., 2016</xref>). The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that HA-mediated binding to SA on innate immune cells is required for cell activation. Indeed, Ab-independent NK cell recognition of IAV-infected cells requires HA binding to NK activating receptors NKp46, NKp44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mandelboim et al., 2001</xref>), 2B4 or NTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duev-Cohen et al., 2016</xref>), and viral NA inhibits this activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bar-On et al., 2013</xref>). Because the Jurkat Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R reporter cells we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">He et al., 2016</xref>) have used are not known to express NK activating receptors, it appears that their requirement for HA binding in Ab-based activation reflects HA binding to other cell surface ligands.</p>
<p>NA blockade of Ab-dependent and independent innate immune cell anti IAV activity supports the possibility that NA inhibitors owe their clinical efficacy to more than just blocking virus release, as suggested by Bar-On <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bar-On et al., 2013</xref>). Further, if innate immune effector functions limit IAV transmission, NA-mediated antagonism could contribute to NA evolution, with NA stalk length possibly being under selective pressure by virtue of its functional interaction with HA-stem specific Abs. Pragmatically, the ability of NA inhibitors to enhance Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>R-mediated innate immune cell activation of stem-Abs bound to viruses or infected cells suggests the possible clinical synergism between NA inhibitors and anti-stem mAbs in humans.</p>

We cultured human embryonal kidney 293T cells(HEK293T) in Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 8&#x0025; FBS (HyClone) and 500 &#x03BC;g/ml gentamicin at 37&#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO2. We used Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher) for BN HA stem mAbs expression. We propagated and cultured the cells as recommended by the manufacturer. We employed the following viruses in this study. The A/Puerto Rico/8/34/H1N1(Walter Gerhart), A/California/07/2009/H1N1, A/Texas/50/2012/H3N2, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013/H3N2, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014/H3N2, A/Puerto Rico/8/34/H1N1/ins20 NA, A/Puerto Rico/8/34/H1N1/del24 NA, chimeric HA influenza virus with HA head domain from the A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), HA stem domain from PR8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hai et al., 2012</xref>) and NA from A/Udorn/72/H3N2 (cH5/1N2). We generated the NA stalk viruses by co-transfection of the eight influenza gene coding plasmids (generously provided by Dr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, New York) as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kosik et al., 2018</xref>). To generate deletion in the NA stalk while preserving cysteine at position 49 we performed mutagenic overlapping PCR with forward primer: 5&#x2019;AGCCATTCA TGC AAGGACACAACTTCAGTGATATTAACC&#x2019;3 and reverse primer: 5&#x2019;TGTGTCCTTGCATGAATGGCTAATCCATATT GAG&#x2019;3. We used the pDZ-NA plasmid as template along with Kod Hot start DNA polymerase (Millipore Sigma). For the NA insertion variant, we used 5 prime phosphorylated forward primer: 5&#x2019;AATTTTCTTACTGAAAAAGTTGTTGCTGGGA AGGACACAACTTCAGTGATATTAACCG&#x2019;3 containing 30 nucleotides from NA stalk region of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96/H5N1 (AF144304): and reverse primer: 5&#x2019;GGTATTGCTGATGTTGACATATGTTTGATTT ACCCAGGTGCTATTTTTATAGGTAATG&#x2019;3 containing 15 nucleotides from NA stalk region of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96/H5N1 and 15 nucleotides from A/WSN/33/H1N1 (LC333187). We followed manufacturer recommendations to PCR mutagenize the pDZ-NA ORF. We recircularized linearized plasmid PCR products with Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche), transformed plasmids into DH5<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> competent cells (Thermo Fisher). After purification with plasmid purification (Qiagen), we sequenced plasmids. To rescue chimeric cH5/1N2, we co-transfected plasmid harboring chimeric HA with N2 plasmid (generously provided by Dr. Peter Palese and Dr. Kanta Subbarao respectively) combined with PR8 core plasmids and followed as described above. For the self-reporting NS1-mCherry expressing virus we first modified reverse genetics system pDZ plasmid as follows.</p>
<p>We cloned NS1-mCherry into the pDZ vector plasmid in several steps. First, we amplified NS1 by PCR with primers NS-5&#x2019;-SapI (GCTCTTCAGGGAGCAAAAGCAGGGTGACAA AG) and NS1-mCherry bot (GCCGCTGCCATCGATGCCAACTTCTGACCTAA TTGTTC). We PCR amplified mCherry with primers NS1-mCherry top (TGGCATCGATGGCAGCGGCATGGTGAGCAA GGGCGAGGAG)and mChe-2A-NEP bot (AGGCTAAAGTTGGTCGCGCCACCGCTGCCCT TGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC). We PCR amplified NEP with primers NEP-exon-1 (GAAAACCCGGGCCCGATGGATCCAAACACTG TGTCAAGCTTTCAGGACATACTGCTGAGGATG TCAA), which encodes NEP exon 1 fused to exon 2, and primer NS-3&#x2019;-SapI(GCTCTTCTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGGTGT TTT). After all amplification steps, we dissected PCR fragments from an agarose gel and purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). We extended NEP fragment further using primers 2A-NEP (GGCGCGACCAACTTTAGCCTACTGAAACAGG CGGGCGATGTGGAAGAAAACCCGGGCCCGATGGA) and NS-3&#x2019;-SapI, which added the &#x201C;self-cleaving&#x201D; 2A sequence of porcine teschovirus. We diluted purified mCherry and 2A-NEP fragments 1:50 and joined with splice-overlap extension PCR using primers NS1-mCherry top and NS-3&#x2019;-SapI. We digested the NS1 fragment and mCherry-2A-NEP fragment with SapI and ClaI restriction enzymes and ligated to pDZ vector digested with SapI. The final construct codes for NS1 fused to a six amino acid linker (GIDGSG) fused to mCherry followed by the 2A sequence and both exons of NEP. We sequenced the final plasmid and used it instead of pDZ-NS in rescue as described above. We propagated viruses in ten days old embryonated chicken eggs for 48 hours and we stored allantoic fluid at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C. For virus purification, we clarified allantoic fluid at 4700 RPM for 10 min, and pelleted virus by centrifugation for 2 hr at 27,000 RPM. We incubated pellets overnight in 2 ml PBS with calcium and magnesium (PBS&#x002B;&#x002B;) and purified virus by centrifugation on a discontinuous 15&#x2013;60&#x0025; sucrose gradient, collecting virus at the interface, and pelleting 34,000 RPM for 2 hr After resuspending the pellet in 500 &#x00B5;l PBS&#x002B;&#x002B; overnight we measured total viral protein with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).</p>

<title>Attachment inhibition (AI) assay</title>
<p>We performed AI assay as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kosik and Yewdell, 2017</xref>). Briefly, we coated black, half area high binding 96-well plates (Nunc) with 50 &#x03BC;l fetuin in DPBS (25 &#x03BC;g/ml) overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. We determined the highest dilution of the virus yielding sufficient signal. We diluted mAbs or H3N2 specific mouse sera initially to 200 nM or 20-fold respectively and then serially by half log<sub>10</sub> steps. We mixed Abs with diluted allantoic fluid and incubated for 60 min at 37&#x00B0;C. We then transferred 50 &#x03BC;l of Ab-virus mixture to washed fetuin-coated plates, incubated for 1h at 4&#x00B0;C, and removed free virus by washing 6-times with DPBS. We added 50 &#x03BC;l of 200 &#x03BC;M MUNANA in 33mM MES pH 6.5 with 4mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x00B0;C. We measured fluorescence (Ex=360nm, Em=450nm) using a Synergy H1 plate reader (Biotek). The signal in the absence of Ab defines 100&#x0025; attachment. We fitted nonlinear regression curves using the dose response inhibition model with GraphPad Prism7 software.</p>

<p>For flow cytometry-based neutralization assay we seeded 50,000 MDCK SIAT1 cells to ninety-six-well tissue culture treated plates (Costar). On the next day, we pre-incubated at 37&#x00B0;C for one hour 50 &#x03BC;l of half log<sub>10</sub> serially diluted Abs with 50 &#x03BC;l of the respective mCherry expressing virus at MOI=0.05-0.1 per well. We diluted Abs and virus in infection media. We transferred virus-Ab mixture to washed MDCK SIAT1 cells and incubated samples at 37&#x00B0;C for the time indicated (4-5 h/18 h). We washed cells twice with DPBS and added 30 &#x03BC;l of 0.005&#x0025; trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) for 20 min, 30 &#x03BC;l BSS-BSA and then 30 &#x03BC;l 1.6&#x0025; paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Science) for 20 min. We sedimented cells by centrifugation at 1,500 RPM for 5 min and washed samples with BSS-BSA two times. We also included uninfected and samples without Ab as controls. For comparing the access of the HA stem epitope in the context of cell expressed HA, we seeded 2.5 million MDCK SIAT1 cells per T25 tissue culture flasks and on the next day infected cells with viruses (moi=1) diluted in infection media. 18 hr p.i., we washed cells twice with DPBS, detached from the flask with trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and combined with half log<sub>10</sub> serial dilutions of mAbs. We incubated samples at 37&#x00B0;C for one hour, washed with BSS-BSA and combined with 50 &#x03BC;l 200x diluted mouse anti-human FITC (Pharmigen) or 5,000x diluted donkey anti-mouse AF488 (Jackson Immunology). We washed samples three times, fixed with 4&#x0025; PFA for 20 min washed three times again and resuspended in BSS-BSA. Samples were analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa X-20 instrument. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). We normalized the frequencies of mCherry positive cells by the non-antibody treated samples and fitted nonlinear regression curves using the dose response inhibition model for neutralization assay or one site binding for epitope access assay with GraphPad Prism7 software.</p>

<title>ADCC assay</title>
<p>We seeded 10,000 MDCK SIAT1 cells to ninety-six-well white tissue culture treated plates (Costar). The following day we washed cells twice with DPBS and infected cells with viruses (moi=5) as described above. At 6 hr p.i. we combined 25 &#x03BC;l of 200nM mAb with 25 &#x03BC;l of ADCC-RL cells (Jurkat cell line expressing luciferase gene under control of the NFAT response element and stably expressing human Fc<italic>&#x03B3;</italic>RIIIa V158) (Promega) containing 50,000 in RPMI 1640 medium with 4&#x0025; low IgG serum (Promega). We added the Ab-ADCC-LR mixture onto the MDCK SIAT1cells (E:T=5:1). After overnight incubation at 37&#x00B0;C in 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>, we added 50&#x03BC;l of Bright-Glo&#x2122; Luciferase Assay lysis/substrate buffer (Promega) and measured luminescence within 5 min using a Synergy H1 plate reader (Biotek). Alternatively, we combined 25 &#x03BC;l of respective virus containing 40 HAU with 25 &#x03BC;l of 300 nM mAb, incubated virus-Ab mixtures at 37&#x00B0;C for one hour and added 25 &#x03BC;l ADCC-LR (50,000). We incubated mixtures overnight at 37&#x00B0;C in 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> and measured luminescence signal as described above. We included samples in the absence of the virus as negative controls. When indicated, in addition to mAbs, mixture of the oseltamivir phospahe (TF, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and zanamivir hydrate (ZNV, Moravek inc) were added to samples at 2.5 &#x03BC;M final concentration. We normalized the data to the signal of FI6 or 310-16G8 on wt PR8 virus. We plotted the data using GraphPad Prism7 software.</p>

<title>NA catalytic activity</title>
<p>We diluted freshly purified viruses (&#x223C;2 &#x03BC;g/ml) in 33mM MES pH 6.5 with 4mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to contain equal NA amount based on multiple immunoblot experiments. We twofold-serially diluted MUNANA in the same buffer starting at 500 &#x03BC;M and pre-incubated virus solutions and MUNANA dilutions at 37&#x00B0;C for 30 min to equilibrate temperatures. We combined 20 &#x03BC;l of virus with 20 &#x03BC;l of respective MUNANA dilution in half area ninety-six-well plate (Costar) and incubated the samples at 37&#x00B0;C to generate fluorescent product of the catalytic reaction. After 60 min incubation we measured fluorescence generated (Ex=360nm, Em=450nm) using a Synergy H1 plate reader (Biotek). We measured background fluorescence of respective MUNANA dilutions and subtracted it from samples. In parallel, we diluted 4-MU (the catalytic product of MUNANA cleavage) serially (twofold) and we measured fluorescence as described above. We generated calibration curve by fitting linear regression in GraphPad Prism7 software and we interpolated amount of 4-MU produced by viruses. We fit the data to Michaelis-Menten regression in GraphPad Prism7 software.</p>

We blotted the grids for 2s at 99&#x0025; relative humidity using 1s wait and drain time respectively. We mounted plunge frozen grids in autogrids assembly and imaged under cryo conditions at 300kV on Titan Krios (ThermoFisher Scientific, Hillsboro, OR) using Falcon II direct electron detector. We collected Cryo 2D Images using a volta phase plate for increased contrast at a nominal magnification of 29K which corresponds to a pixel size of 2.87&#x00C5; with 1 micron defocus at a total dose of 12 e<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/&#x00C5;<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>We infected mice intranasally with PR8 influenza A wt, del24 or ins20 NA variant viruses (3,000-5,000 TCID<sub>50</sub>). At 4 days p.i., we sacrificed the mice and inflated lung by 10&#x0025; buffered formalin through the trachea We fixed lungs overnight and processed for paraffin embedding. We made serial sections at 5 um thickness and stained every 10th slides by Hematoxylin and Eosin. We dewaxed the unstained and stained with influenza NP antibody (rabbit, 172) followed with Alexa 488 conjugated rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). We also counterstained with 4&#x2019;,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI). We digitally scanned the light and fluorescence slides by NDP NanoZoomer XR whole slide scanning system (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) and stored as ndpi format for further analysis. We used Imaris Image analysis software (Bitplane USA, Concord, MA) for examining histopathology and influenza A NP stained cells. We exported the analyzed data to Prism 7 software (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA) for statistical analysis.</p>

<caption><title>Characterizing anti-stem Ab inhibition of attachment and NA activity</title>
<p><list list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>We pre-incubated the indicated viruses with the Abs indicated and added to fetuin coated plate at 4&#x00B0;C to enable virus attachment. After removal of free virus we added MUNANA (a fluorogenic substrate for NA) and measured fluorescent signal. Note that stem-Abs do not block attachment, which is efficiently blocked by head specific Abs (IC5-4F8 for PR8, polyclonal mouse serum for HK68). Data are normalized to the fluorescent signal in absence of Ab (set to 100&#x0025;). Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We tested BN HA Abs mediated NAI on the HA/NA detergent dissociated virus. TX100 dissociated PR8 H1N1 and HK68 H3N2 viruses were incubated with BN HA Abs. We transferred the mixtures to fetuin coated plate and performed ELLA. We normalized the data by NA activity in the absence of the Ab (set to 100&#x0025;). Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples acquired in two independent experiments. Similar results were obtained in two experiments.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>We tested mobility shift of the wt, del24 and ins20 NA in WB and we quantified the signal for NA and HA2 to determine relative amounts of glycoproteins in the virus. Two independent virus preparations were tested in duplicate-triplicates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We compared elution properties of NA variant viruses on RBCs. We normalized viruses by equal NA activity (determined by MUNANA) and maximal elution of wt at 7h was set as 100&#x0025; elution. Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples acquired in two independent experiments. We compared viral growth fitness of NA variant viruses on MDCK SIAT1 cell line (growth kinetics) or in mice (endpoint replication). Error bars indicate the SD of thriplicate-tetraplicate samples.</p></list-item>

<caption><title>BN HA Abs epitope accessibility</title>
<p>We performed ELISA on amount normalized purified NA variant viruses. We infected MDCK SIAT1 cells with NA variant viruses (moi=1) and at 18 h p.i. we pre-incubated cells with serial dilutions of BN HA Abs. After staining with secondary Ab we measured the positive fraction at given Ab concentration. Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples acquired in two independent experiments.</p></caption>

<caption><title>BN HA Abs influence on intracellular and cell surface expression of the viral proteins.</title>
<p>We relatively quantified NA and NP expression by indirect immunostaining (in cell western) in MDCK SIAT1 cells treated by BN HA mAbs 4 h p.i. with NA variant viruses. We present combined data for treatment with 310-16G8 and 310-18F8. Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples. Similar results were obtained in three to four independent experiments. Four hr p.i. of MDCK SIAT1 cells with the viruses indicated we added graded amounts of the TW1.3 mAb (irrelevant antibody). Six hr later, we collected the supernatant and used NA activity against a fluorescent substrate to quantitate released virions. The fluorescent signal in absence of Ab was set as 100&#x0025; for each virus. Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples acquired in up to four independent experiments.</p></caption>
