<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Imprinted genes are epigenetically modified during gametogenesis and maintain the established epigenetic signatures after fertilization, causing parental-specific gene expression. In this study, we show that imprinted paternally-expressed genes (PEGs) in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> endosperm are marked by an epigenetic signature of Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 together with heterochromatic H3K9me2 and CHG methylation, which specifically mark the silenced maternal alleles of PEGs. Based on the presence of this epigenetic signature on maternal alleles we were able to predict novel PEGs and could confirm several of those using published and novel datasets generated in this study. The combined activity of the otherwise largely exclusive H3K27me3 together with the heterochromatic H3K9me3 has also been reported to silence the maternal <italic>Xist</italic> locus in mammalian preimplantation embryos, suggesting an evolutionary conserved employment of both pathways during reproduction.</p>

<title>AUTHOR SUMMARY</title>
<p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon causing parental alleles to be active depending on their parent-of-origin. In plants, imprinted genes are mainly confined to the endosperm, an ephemeral tissue supporting embryo development. Differential methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) established by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a major regulatory mechanism determining activity of paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) in animals and plants. Here, we show that the coding region of many PEGs is marked by an epigenetic signature of H3K27me3, H3K9me2 and CHG methylation and that the combination of these three modifications correlates with paternally-biased gene expression in the endosperm. The maternal alleles of PEGs are marked by CHG methylation in the central cell, indicating that the repressive epigenetic signature of PEGs is established before fertilization. We use the presence of the three modifications to predict novel PEGs and propose that genomic imprinting is substantially more common than previously estimated based on expression data.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon causing maternal and paternal alleles to be differentially expressed after fertilization. In plants, genomic imprinting is mainly confined to the endosperm, an ephemeral nutritive tissue supporting embryo growth, similar to the placenta in mammals [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The endosperm is the product of a double fertilization event, where one of the haploid sperm cells fertilizes the haploid egg cell giving rise to the diploid embryo, while the second sperm cell fertilizes the diploid central cell to give rise to the triploid endosperm [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Imprinted genes are epigenetically modified during gamete formation and the established epigenetic asymmetry is maintained after fertilization. Differential DNA methylation is established by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME) that removes methylated cytosine residues in the central cell of the female gametophyte [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DME is not active in sperm, leading to differential DNA methylation between male and female genomes in the endosperm. DME acts on small transposable elements (TEs) in the vicinity of genes [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and its activity has been connected to the expression of maternally-expressed imprinted genes (MEGs). Hypomethylation can furthermore expose binding sites for the Fertilization Independent Seed (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], an evolutionary conserved chromatin modifying complex that applies a trimethylation mark on histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Arabidopsis FIS-PRC2 consists of the subunits MEDEA (MEA), FIS2, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1) [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is specifically active in the central cell of the female gametophyte and in the endosperm [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Repression of the maternal alleles of PEGs is mediated by the activity of the FIS-PRC2 [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], consistent with maternal PEG alleles being marked by H3K27me3 [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this manuscript, we addressed the mechanism of maternal allele repression in PEGs. We surprisingly found that PEGs are regulated by two otherwise largely exclusive epigenetic repressive pathways, the FIS2-PRC2 and the pathway establishing the heterochromatin-localized H3K9me2 modification [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We demonstrate that both modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2, overlap on the maternal alleles of the majority of PEGs. Our data suggest that most likely FIS-PRC2 acts first and is required to establish H3K9me2. Furthermore, we find maternal alleles of PEGs to be marked by CHG methylation in the central cell, indicating that repressive pathways establishing H3K27me3, H3K9me2 and CHG methylation act in the central cell of the female gametophyte. Finally, we use the presence of the three modifications to predict novel PEGs and propose that the number of PEGs predicted based on expression data strongly underestimates the real number of PEGs.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The maternal alleles of PEGs are marked by H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHG methylation</title>
<p>In a previous study, we revealed that H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 overlapped at paternal heterochromatic regions in the endosperm, suggesting a partial functional redundancy of both modifications [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We now addressed the question whether this redundancy extends to other regions of the genome. We found that about one-third of genes marked by H3K27me3 on the maternal alleles were also marked by H3K9me2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, hypergeometric test, <italic>P</italic>=0; S1 Fig, <italic>P</italic>=0). Genes containing both modifications on their maternal alleles had significantly higher levels of H3K27me3 compared to those only marked by H3K27me3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, S1 Fig). The majority of double-marked genes contained both modifications specifically on the maternal but not the paternal alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, S1 Fig) and increasing levels of H3K27me3 on maternal alleles correlated with increasing levels of H3K9me2 on the maternal but not the paternal alleles (S2 Fig). We thus proposed that the presence of both modifications on the maternal alleles correlates with paternally-biased expression. Consistent with this notion we found that genes previously identified as PEGs [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were substantially enriched for both modifications on their maternal alleles, while MEGs did not show enrichment of both marks on either maternal or paternal alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, S1 Fig). This trend was independent of the direction of the cross and similarly observed in Col x L<italic>er</italic> and L<italic>er</italic> x Col crosses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and S1 Fig). The presence of H3K27me3 is generally confined to gene bodies [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], consistent with the observed enrichment of H3K27me3 in gene bodies of PEG maternal alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and S1 Fig). Interestingly, H3K9me2 was similarly restricted to gene bodies of PEGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and S1 Fig), contrasting the exclusion of H3K9me2 from genic regions in sporophytic tissues [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The maternal alleles of PEGs were also strongly enriched for CHG methylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, S1 and S2 Figs), consistent with the chromomethylase 3 (CMT3) acting in a positive feedback loop with the histone methyltransferase proteins KYP/SUVH4, SUVH5, and SUVH6 [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Levels of CHH methylation were generally higher on maternal than on paternal alleles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, S1 Fig), consistent with depletion of CHH methylation in sperm [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

<title>Maternal-specific CHG methylation is established in the central cell and depends on FIS-PRC2</title>
<p>PEGs had increased levels of CHG methylation in the central cell, but low CHG methylation in sperm and vegetative cells of pollen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), revealing that differences in CHG methylation are established before fertilization. The FIS-PRC2 had been proposed to promote non-CG methylation [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], raising the hypothesis that increased CHG methylation on the maternal alleles of PEGs depends on the activity of FIS-PRC2 in the central cell. Consistently, we observed strongly decreased CHG methylation on the maternal alleles of PEGs in seeds lacking maternal FIE activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), suggesting that FIS-PRC2 activity is required to recruit CHG methylation. The DNA glycosylase DME is required for the activation of <italic>MEA</italic> and <italic>FIS2</italic>, both encoding subunits of the FIS-PRC2 [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Maternal PEG alleles had reduced levels of CHG methylation in seeds lacking maternal DME activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), supporting the notion that FIS-PRC2 activity is required for CHG methylation establishment on maternal PEG alleles.</p>

<p>Previous work revealed that loss of FIS-PRC2 function caused activation of maternal PEG alleles [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We addressed the question whether loss of CMT3 and the redundantly acting SUVH4,5,6 [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] similarly affect silencing of maternal PEG alleles. Based on published expression studies, <italic>CMT3, SUVH4</italic>, and <italic>SUVH6</italic> are expressed in the central cell of the female gametophyte [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The maternal alleles of seven tested PEGs remained silenced in reciprocal crosses of wild type with <italic>cmt3</italic> and <italic>suvh4,5,6</italic> triple mutants (S3 Fig), indicating that stable silencing of the maternal alleles of PEGs does not depend on CMT3 and SUVH4,5,6 activity before fertilization. We tested the requirement of CMT3 and SUVH4,5,6 for PEG regulation after fertilization by monitoring PEG expression in homozygous mutant <italic>cmt3</italic> and <italic>suvh4,5,6</italic> seeds. None of the seven tested genes was significantly upregulated in seeds of <italic>cmt3</italic> or <italic>suvh4,5,6</italic> mutants (S3 Fig), indicating that CMT3 and SUVH4,5,6 are not required for repression of maternal PEG alleles after fertilization. In the <italic>suvh4,5,6</italic> triple mutant, H3K9me2 is genomewide eliminated in vegetative tissues [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, whether H3K9me2 is similarly eliminated in the central cell and endosperm remains to be shown. Therefore, deciphering the role of H3K9me2 in repressing the maternal alleles of PEGs remains to be subject of future investigations.</p>

<title>Paternally-biased expression coincides with the combination of H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHG methylation</title>
<p>We addressed the question whether the presence of H3K9me2 and CHG methylation is functionally relevant for maternal allele repression by testing whether the presence of both modifications either alone or in combination with H3K27me3 correlates with maternal allele repression. Strikingly, while the presence of either CHG methylation, H3K9me2, or H3K27me3 on maternal alleles did not shift the allelic balance, the combination of more than one modification shifted the balance towards preferential paternal allele expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, S5 Fig), suggesting that the combined presence of H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHG methylation is a hallmark for maternal allele repression. Consistently, increased bias towards paternal allele expression correlated with increased levels of H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHG methylation on maternal alleles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, S5 Fig).</p>

<p>We tested which combination of marks would most reliably allow predicting paternally-biased genes. We assigned scores for the allele-specific presence of the three modifications (see S1 Table) and tested whether highly scoring genes were enriched for previously predicted PEGs [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The combination of CHG methylation in the central cell together with maternal-specific H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 allowed to predict the highest number of previously described PEGs in Col and L<italic>er</italic> accessions (24 out of 42 (57&#x0025;), [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) in relation to the number of genes in the category with the highest score (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, S1 Table) and was chosen for further analysis. The category with the highest score was significantly enriched for PEGs (hypergeometric test, <italic>P</italic>=1.0e-32); while categories with lower scores contained only few PEGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Similarly, out of 64 PEGs that had been predicted by a recent study re-evaluating previously published imprintome datasets [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], 40 (62&#x0025;) PEGs were present in the highest score category (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Nearly half (96 genes, 46.4&#x0025;) of those genes in the highest score category were significantly paternally biased (Chi-square &#x003C;0.05, Bonferroni corrected, S2 Table), which was significantly more than the 8&#x0025; paternally-biased genes identified among all genes tested (Hypergeometric test, <italic>P</italic>= 8.9e-52). We thus conclude that the presence of the three modifications, CHG in the central cell, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 on maternal alleles in the endosperm allows to predict genes with paternally-biased expression. Paternally biased genes were particularly involved in transcriptional regulation (<italic>P</italic>=7.54e-5) and chromatin organization (<italic>P</italic>=1.57e-3), consistent with previous reports on the functional role of PEGs [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Maternal seed coat contamination restricts the identification of PEGs</title>
<p>Published endosperm transcriptome data contain a substantial fraction of transcripts from the maternal seed coat, which may limit the correct prediction of paternally-biased genes [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We hypothesized that there are several genes that based on their epigenetic modifications (score 12, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> and S2 Table) are likely to be PEGs but based on available expression data are not correctly classified. A prediction of this hypothesis is that genes in the highest score category that have been classified as biallelically expressed or maternally-biased are more highly expressed in the seed coat than those with paternally-biased expression. We tested this hypothesis using available expression data of seed coat tissue [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] at a similar developmental stage as published endosperm expression data [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Indeed, genes with paternally-biased expression were significantly less expressed in the seed coat compared to genes that based on available expression data are either predicted to be biallelically expressed or maternally-biased (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.005; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), strongly suggesting that maternal tissue contamination in available expression data limits the prediction of PEGs. To further test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic reporter lines containing the promoter (&#x2243;2kb) and downstream genic regions fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of seven genes belonging to the highest score category but predicted to be maternally (<italic>AT2G33620, AT1G43580, AT1G47530, AT1G64660, AT2G30590, AT4G15390</italic>) or biallelically expressed (<italic>AT5G53160</italic>). We detected a GFP signal in the endosperm only for construct <italic>AT1G64660</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, S3Table). For construct <italic>AT1G47530</italic> a signal was detected in the seed coat, while for the other constructs no GFP signal was detected in seeds, indicating that the regulatory elements required for the expression of those genes are located outside the promoter and genic regions used to generate the reporter lines. Reciprocal crosses using the <italic>AT1G64660</italic> reporter lines revealed that this gene is indeed a PEG and strongly expressed in the endosperm when paternally, but not when maternally inherited (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This data support the hypothesis that seed coat contamination limits the transcriptome-based identification of PEGs.</p>

<p>To test whether we could confirm additional PEGs that have been predicted based on their epigenetic signatures, we applied INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) to purify endosperm nuclei at 4 days after pollination (DAP) from Col &#x00D7; L<italic>er</italic> and L<italic>er</italic> &#x00D7; Col reciprocal crosses. Isolated RNA was sequenced and profiled for allele-specific gene expression. By analyzing the maternal to total reads ratio in each epigenetic category, we confirmed that the genes in the highest score category (group with score 12) indeed showed a clear trend towards paternally-biased expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, S4 Table). Following previously established criteria [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we predicted 107 PEGs that were reciprocally imprinted in both directions of the crosses. There was a significantly higher number of PEGs present in the highest score category compared to a representative random sample of genes with informative reads (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the highest score category had the highest frequency of PEGs, with other categories having significantly fewer PEGs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Of the 107 genes that we predicted as PEGs based on our RNA sequencing data, 38 were present in the highest score category, which is significantly more than expected by chance (p=3.6 e-59, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Out of those, 20 were previously predicted based on published data [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while 18 genes are likely new high-confidence PEGs, revealing that PEGs are more common than previously estimated.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we identified the concomitant presence of maternal-specific CHG methylation, H3K27me3, and H3K9me2 as an epigenetic signature for paternally-biased expression in the endosperm. We furthermore predict that there are substantially more PEGs than previously reported in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], suggesting that in Arabidopsis the number of PEGs exceeds the number of MEGs. Recent re-evaluation of published imprintome data of Arabidopsis revealed that a large number of previously predicted MEGs were seed coat expressed genes, while the number of PEGs was underestimated [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our study supports and extends this notion by showing that there is a large number of paternally-biased genes that likely failed to be identified in previous studies because of maternal seed coat contamination or early stage-specific expression.</p>
<p>A previous study reported that the maternal alleles of PEGs in <italic>A. lyrata</italic> are marked by CHG methylation and implicated that closely related species use different mechanisms to regulate imprinted gene expression [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our study reveals that similar to <italic>A. lyrata</italic> the maternal alleles of many PEGs are also marked by CHG methylation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, highlighting that epigenetic mechanisms employed to maintain monoallelic expression are rather conserved between related species. Interestingly, while the maternal alleles of PEGs in maize are marked by H3K27me3, they are not marked by CHG methylation [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], indicating that diverged species may use different mechanism in maintaining maternal allele repression.</p>
<p>How H3K9me2 and CHG methylation are established at PRC2 target genes remains to be studied; however, the strong activation of maternal PEG alleles upon loss of FIS-PRC2 function [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] suggests that H3K9me2 and CHG methylation require FIS-PRC2 function. The PRC2 is generally targeting genes with specific roles during development [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while complexes establishing H3K9me2 are mainly targeting TEs localized in heterochromatic regions of the genome [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This functional division of PRC2 and machineries establishing heterochromatic marks is conserved in plants as well as in mammals [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, there are notable exceptions to this rule in both groups of organisms. In rice seedlings, about one-third of H3K27me3 marked genes are also marked by CHG and CHH methylation [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similar to the findings reported in our study, higher levels of H3K27me3 correlate with higher CHG and CHH methylation in gene bodies of rice [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The rice H3K27me3 methyltransferase SDG711 physically interacts with the CHH methyltransferase OsDMR2 and the SRA-domain containing SUVH protein SDG703, uncovering a mechanistic connection between PRC2 and non-CG methylation. In mammalian cells, H3K9 methyltransferases colocalize with PRC2 [<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], revealing crosstalk between these two major epigenetic silencing pathways that likely is required for stable gene silencing. The imprinted maternal <italic>Xist</italic> locus encoding an X-linked long-noncoding RNA is covered by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 in preimplantation embryos [<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Importantly, loss of maternal H3K27me3 induces <italic>Xist</italic> activation, indicating that maternal H3K27me3 is the major imprinting mark of <italic>Xist</italic> [<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is strikingly similar to findings made in this study revealing H3K27me3 as the major repressive mark for PEGs. Recent work revealed that maternal H3K27me3 controls DNA methylation-independent imprinting in mammalian preimplantation embryos [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While imprinted expression of most genes is lost in the embryonic cell lineage, few genes maintain their imprinted expression in the extra-embryonic cell lineage [<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The <italic>Xist</italic> locus that is marked by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 is among those loci that remain imprinted in extra-embryonic tissues [<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Whether the presence of both marks distinguishes those genes that maintain their imprinted expression from those that become biallelically expressed remains to be tested, but we consider this a very attractive hypothesis. We speculate that the presence of both marks in certain tissue types of mammals and flowering plants is a conserved epigenetic signature marking stably repressed genes.</p>

A total of 250mg of siliques per sample was collected at 4DAP. Tissue homogenization and nuclei purification were performed from three biological replicates as previously described [<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted from purified nuclei using the mirVana Isolation Kit Protocol (Ambion). mRNA extraction was performed using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation and the Libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit from Illumina. Samples were sequenced at the National Genomic Infrastructure (NGI) from SciLife Laboratory (Uppsala, Sweden) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in paired-end 125bp read length.
