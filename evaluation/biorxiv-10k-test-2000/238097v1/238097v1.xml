<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>The biological properties of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain incompletely defined and the central regulators are unknown. By bioinformatic analysis of a PCSC-enriched gene signature, we identified the transcription factor HNF1A as a putative central regulator of PCSC function. Levels of HNF1A and its target genes were found to be elevated in PCSCs and tumorspheres, and depletion of HNF1A resulted in growth inhibition, apoptosis, impaired tumorsphere formation, PCSC depletion, and downregulation of OCT4 expression. Conversely, HNF1A overexpression increased PCSC numbers and tumorsphere formation in pancreatic cancer cells and drove PDA cell growth. Importantly, depletion of HNF1A in primary tumor xenografts impaired tumor growth and depleted PCSCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we established an HNF1A-dependent gene signature in PDA cells that significantly correlated with reduced survivability in patients. These findings identify HNF1A as a central transcriptional regulator of the PCSC state and novel oncogene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is projected to be the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. by 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rahib et al., 2014</xref>). The exceeding lethality of PDA is attributed to a complex of qualities frequent to the disease including early and aggressive metastasis and limited responsiveness to current standards of care. While both aspects are in-and-of-themselves multifaceted and can be partially attributed to factors such as the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Olive et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Provenzano et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Waghray et al., 2016</xref>) and the mutational profile of the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Yachida et al., 2012</xref>), cancer stem cells (CSCs) have also been identified to contribute to promoting early metastasis and resistance to therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hermann et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>CSCs, which were originally identified in leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonnet and Dick, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Graham et al., 2002</xref>), have been identified in a number of solid tumors including glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Singh et al., 2003</xref>), pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hermann et al., 2007</xref>) and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">O&#x2019;Brien et al., 2007</xref>). In these cases, CSCs have been characterized by the ability to establish disease in immunocompromised mice, to resist chemotherapeutics, the capability of both self-renewal and differentiation into the full complement of heterogeneous neoplastic cells that comprise the tumor, and the propensity to metastasize. In each case, CSCs are distinguished from other tumor cell types by the expression of various, sometimes divergent cell surface markers. Our lab was the first to identify pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs), which were found to express the markers EPCAM (ESA), CD44, and CD24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to these markers, CD133 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hermann et al., 2007</xref>), CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hermann et al., 2007</xref>), c-MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2011</xref>), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), and autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miranda-Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>) have all been proposed markers of PCSCs. In all cases, the identified cells are characterized by being able to form spheres of cells (tumorspheres) under non-adherent, serum-free conditions, as well as an increased ability to form tumors in mice compared to bulk tumor cells. While a number of markers have been identified for PCSCs, relatively little is known about the transcriptional platforms that govern their function and set them apart from the majority of bulk PDA cells. Transcriptional regulators such NOTCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 2014</xref>), BMI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Proctor et al., 2013</xref>), and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Herreros-Villanueva et al., 2013</xref>) have been demonstrated to play roles in PCSCs, although these proteins are also critical for normal stem cell function in many tissues.</p>
<p>In this study we sought to better understand the biological heterogeneity of PCSCs and their bulk cell counterparts in an effort to identify novel regulators of PCSCs in the context of low-passage, primary patient-derived PDA cells. Using microarray analysis and comparing primary PDA cell subpopulations with different levels tumorigenic potential and stem cell-like function, we identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A), an endoderm-restricted transcription factor, as a key regulator of the PCSC state. Supporting this hypothesis, depletion of HNF1A resulted in a loss of PCSC numbers and functionality both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, ectopic expression of HNF1A augmented PCSC properties in PDA cells and enhanced growth and anchorage-independence in normal pancreatic cell lines. Mechanistically, we found that HNF1A regulates the stem cell transcription factor OCT4 (POU5F1), which is necessary for stemness in PCSCs. Based on these data we postulate a novel pro-oncogenic function for HNF1A through its maintenance of the pancreatic cancer stem cell state.</p>

<title>An HNF1A gene signature dominates a PCSC gene signature</title>
<p>A transcriptional profile of PCSCs has yet to be established, and we hypothesized that such a profile would contain key regulators of the PCSC state. To pursue this hypothesis, we utilized a series of low-passage, patient derived PDA cell lines to isolate PCSC-enriching and nonenriching subpopulations for comparative analysis. Using two of our previously described PCSC surface markers, CD44 and EPCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2007</xref>), we found that low-passage PDA cells generally formed three subpopulations (abbreviated P herein) based on surface staining: CD44<sup>High</sup>/EPCAM<sup>Low</sup> (P1), CD44<sup>High</sup>/EPCAM<sup>High</sup> (P2), or CD44<sup>Low</sup>/EPCAM<sup>High</sup> (P3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Similar expression patterns were observed in 10 primary tumor samples (data not shown). Using previously described measures of PCSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2011</xref>), including co-expression of the PCSC marker CD24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>), the ability for isolated subpopulations to reestablish cellular heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), the ability to form tumorspheres under non-adherent/serum-free culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>), and initiate tumors in immune-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we found that P2 cells showed greater enrichment for cells with PCSC properties than their P1 and P3 counterparts.</p>
<p>Using 2 primary PDA lines (NY8 and NY15), P1, P2, and P3 PDA cells were sorted by flow cytometry, prepped immediately for mRNA, and analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarray and validated by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that P2 cells from both lines exhibited a signature of 50 genes that was upregulated (&#x003E;1.5 fold) relative to both P1 and P3 cell counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further refine this gene cohort, we utilized oPOSSUM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>), a web-based system to detect overrepresented transcription factor binding sites in gene sets. Interestingly, HNF1A, a P2 cohort gene itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), had predicted binding sites in the &#x00B1;5000 regions (from start of transcription) of 17/50 of the enriched genes, and due to its stringent consensus sequence (DGTTAATNATTAAC) was the most highly ranked common transcription factor by Z-score (17.895). Of these 50 genes, HNF1A is known to positively regulate cohort genes <italic>HNF4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boj et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>NR5A2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Molero et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>CDH17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>IGFBP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babajko et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Powell and Suwanichkul, 1993</xref>), and <italic>DPP4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gu et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have recently identified certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HNF1A locus as risk factors for developing PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pierce and Ahsan, 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), although the mechanism by which these SNPs exert their influence is currently unknown. To further support the enrichment of HNF1A in PCSCs, sorted cells were western blotted for HNF1A and one of HNF1A&#x2019;s target proteins, CDH17. Both proteins were found to be elevated in P2 cell lysates compared to other subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in agreement with their transcript levels. Additionally, surface expression of DPP4 (CD26) was also found to be highest on cells in the P2 subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). CSCs are enriched in cancer cell populations grown under low-attachment tumorsphere (S) conditions compared to cells grown in adherent (A) conditions. In keeping with this observation, we found protein levels of HNF1A and CDH17 elevated in multiple PDA lines cultured under tumorsphere conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>, data not shown). Using a GFP-based reporter driven by 8 tandem copies of the HNF1A consensus sequence GGTTAATGATTAACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>), we found GFP expression was elevated in NY5, NY8, and NY15 cells grown under tumorsphere (S) compared to adherent conditions (A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). This construct showed excellent dependence on HNF1A expression as targeting HNF1A with an HNF1A-specific siRNA ablated expression of both the ectopic GFP and endogenous CDH17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). Lastly, we found the frequency of GFP positive cells increased in cells grown in suspension, with GFP expression being highest in the P2 subpopulation of NY15 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>). Based on our gene expression and tumorsphere data, we hypothesized that HNF1A is a central regulator of CSC function.</p>

<title>HNF1A is a critical regulator of CSC function in PDA cells</title>
<p>Consistent with our hypothesis that HNF1A may be an integral component of PDA biology we observed higher levels of HNF1A protein and transcripts in PDA cells compared to nontransformed immortalized pancreatic cell lines HPNE (N) and HPDE (D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3A, B</xref>). Immunostaining of a PDA tissue microarray showed HNF1A expression to be significantly elevated (p&#x003C;0.0001) in PDA neoplastic ducts (n&#x003D;41) compared to normal pancreatic ducts (n&#x003D;18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3C, D</xref>). To examine the role of HNF1A in PDA cells, we depleted the protein with two distinct siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Knockdown of HNF1A resulted in reduced cell numbers in several primary PDA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, knockdown of HNF1A resulted in more profound growth inhibition in cells with moderate to high HNF1A expression (NY5, NY8, NY15) than cells with low HNF1A expression (NY90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplementary Figure 3A, B</xref>). To determine whether the apparent loss in cell number was due to apoptotic cell death, we performed annexin V/DAPI staining on control and HNF1A-depleted NY5, NY8, and NY15 cells. In all cases, knockdown of HNF1A resulted in a significant (p&#x003C;0.05) increase in early and late apoptotic cells, while not affecting necrotic cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, increased cleavage of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9 was observed in cells depleted of HNF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating apoptotic cell death. These data indicate that HNF1A is important for PDA cell growth/survival and basal expression levels predict response to targeting.</p>
<p>Next we pursued whether depletion of HNF1A impacted PDA subpopulation distribution. Consistent with a central role in maintaining PDA cell heterogeneity, we consistently found that knockdown of HNF1A in multiple PDA lines resulted in loss of P2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), supporting a role for HNF1A in maintaining PDA cell heterogeneity. In addition to a decrease in CD44 surface expression, we also observed a marked decrease in CD24 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>) and mRNA levels (data not shown); suggesting that loss of HNF1A depletes the CSC compartment. Knockdown of HNF1A did not change surface expression levels of EPCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, data not shown). To assess functional consequences of HNF1A-depletion on the PCSC compartment, cells (NY8, NY15) expressing HNF1A shRNAs were grown under tumorsphere-promoting conditions. These shRNAs effectively depleted HNF1A as well as CDH17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating downstream signaling inhibition. Consistent with a role in PCSC function, HNF1A knockdown showed a marked reduction in tumorsphere formation (p&#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).</p>

<title>HNF1A exhibits oncogenic properties in pancreatic cells</title>
<p>We next sought to determine whether CSC properties could be augmented by ectopic expression of HNF1A in PDA cells. Using doxycycline-inducible expression of HNF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), we noted increased expression of CD24, CD44, and EPCAM in multiple primary PDA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>, data not shown). To determine whether HNF1A could drive tumorsphere formation, using NY15 and NY53 (a model for low endogenous HNF1A expression) we found that HNF1A-expressing cells formed &#x007E;2.5 fold more tumorspheres than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similar results were also seen in moderate-HNF1A expressing cells NY8 (data not shown).</p>
<p>We next examined the effects of ectopic HNF1A expression in the non-tumorigenic pancreatic ductal cell lines HPDE and HPNE, which were devoid of endogenous HNF1A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Doxycycline-inducible ectopic expression of HNF1A alone or in concert with ectopic KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> was readily achieved in HPDE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> induced phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and AKT in HPDE cells. Similar effects were seen in HPNE cells constitutively expressing HNF1A and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). We then tested the impact the of HNF1A and/or KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> expression, either alone or in combination, on HPDE cell growth. Under normal growth conditions with serum, (LacZ) HPDE cells grew to confluency but did not form colonies, presumably due to contact-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). Expression of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, however, resulted in colony formation, indicating a bypass of contact inhibition. HNF1A alone resulted in significantly increased colony formation, which was further enhanced by the additional expression of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. Similar effects were seen in HPNE cells (data not shown). In clonogenicity assays, HNF1A-expressing HPNE cells formed similar numbers of colonies to control and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G</xref>), however, HNF1A alone promoted enhanced colony size. HPDE cells failed to form colonies at clonal densities in the presence of serum. In addition to foci formation, anchorage-independent growth can indicate cellular transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>. When suspended in soft agar, control HPDE cells failed to grow over a 21-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). The addition of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> alone did not significantly promote colony formation, consistent with its relatively weak transforming ability in HPDE cells. Interestingly, HNF1A alone resulted in numerous small colonies which in turn synergized with the expression of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> in the form of numerous large colonies. Neither HNF1A nor KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> alone resulted in anchorage-independent growth in HPNE cells (data not shown). Lastly, we examined the effects of both transgenes on PCSC marker expression. Expression of HNF1A increased expression of EPCAM, CD44, and CD24 in HPDE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4A, C</xref>). Control HPNE cells lacked expression of both EPCAM and CD24, but expressed high levels of CD44. Expression of HNF1A was able to increase CD44 surface expression, while not changing EPCAM status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>, data not shown). Remarkably, CD24 was potently induced upon HNF1A expression, with nearly 84&#x0025; of HPNE cells expressing CD24 compared to 0.5&#x0025; of LacZ-expressing control cells. These data would suggest that HNF1A possesses properties of an oncogene capable of cooperation with oncogenic KRAS. <italic>HNF1A is required for tumor growth and cancer stem cells maintenance in vivo</italic> To determine whether HNF1A was necessary for tumorigenesis, we implanted two primary lines (NY5 and NY15) expressing control or two HNF1A-targeting shRNAs orthotopically in the pancreas of NOD/SCID mice. HNF1A-depleted cells showed significantly reduced tumor growth compared to their control cohorts (p&#x003C;0.05), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Similar results were observed with HNF1A knockdown in subcutaneous xenografts of NY 5 and NY15 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). To determine whether inhibition of tumor growth was due to effects on the PCSC compartment, NY5 tumors were dissociated and analyzed by flow cytometry. Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, the EPCAM&#x002B;/CD44&#x002B;/CD24&#x002B; cell population was significantly reduced in HNF1A-depleted tumors (p&#x003C;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). Importantly, western blot analysis of resultant tumor lysates confirmed that shRNAs remained effective at depleting HNF1A during the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, Mason&#x2019;s trichrome staining of NY5 tumors showed marked increase in mouse stromal infiltration and greater epithelial cell architecture in HNF1A-depleted tumors compared to control tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>), the latter suggesting a shift to a more differentiated tumor histology.</p>

<title>HNF1A regulates stemness through OCT4 expression</title>
<p>As a direct relationship between HNF1A and stem cell function has not been reported, we examined mRNA expression of central stemness regulators <italic>MYC, SOX2, KLF4, NANOG</italic>, and <italic>POU5F1</italic> (OCT4) in HNF1A-depleted cells. Of these transcription factors, only <italic>POU5F1</italic> mRNA showed consistent downregulation in multiple PDA cell lines in response to HNF1A knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, data not shown). Similarly, we found that <italic>POU5F1</italic> mRNA was upregulated in response to overexpression of HNF1A in both PDA cells and HPDE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating regulation of OCT4 expression by HNF1A in pancreatic-lineage cells. OCT4 has previously been shown to be elevated in PCSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miranda-Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Luo et al., 2017</xref>), although a functional role for the protein has not been demonstrated in this context. To determine if OCT4 regulation was a key event in HNF1A-dependent stemness, we targeted OCT4 with multiple siRNA, either in combination or as single sequences. Depletion of OCT4 resulted in a pronounced inhibition of tumorsphere formation, comparable to HNF1A knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-G</xref>). Importantly, knockdown of either HNF1A or OCT4 had comparable effects on the protein levels of OCT4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the isoform responsible for imparting stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). To determine whether expression of OCT4A was sufficient to rescue stemness of PDA cells depleted of HNF1A, NY8 and NY15 cells were transduced with OCT4A-expressing lentiviruses or vector controls and transfected with HNF1A siRNA. Consistent with our previous results, loss of HNF1A impaired tumorsphere formation in both lines expressing the vector control, however, this effect was overcome by the expression of OCT4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Supplementary Figure 6A, B</xref>). These data indicate that HNF1A mediates stemness of PCSCs through regulation of OCT4. <italic>An HNF1A gene signature is associated with poor survival in PDA patients</italic> Lastly we sought to gain insight into the transcriptional activity of HNF1A in PDA and determine whether its transcriptome held prognostic information similar to other signatures in PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Collisson et al., 2011</xref>). In order to identify transcriptional targets of HNF1A, we performed Bru-seq, a variation of RNA-seq which measures changes in nascent RNA levels <italic>(bone fide</italic> transcription rate) as opposed to steady-state RNA changes measured by conventional RNA-seq and microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Paulsen et al., 2013</xref>). Using concomitant ChIP-seq from control and HNF1A depleted NY8 and NY15 cells using an HNF1A-specific antibody, we identified 243 HNF1A-activated and 46 HNF1A-repressed transcripts shared between NY8 and NY15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). 139/239 (57.2&#x0025;) and 11/46 (23.9&#x0025;) HNF1A-activated/repressed genes showed detectable HNF1A binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), either distal or proximal to the transcriptional start site, supporting the role of HNF1A as a transcriptional activator. Importantly, a number of known HNF1A target genes exhibited HNF1A promoter-proximal binding and transcriptional responsiveness via Bru-seq/ChIP-seq, including <italic>CDH17</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Additionally, the PCSC marker <italic>EPCAM</italic> also showed HNF1A distal binding and transcriptional responsiveness, implicating HNF1A as a direct regulator of this gene. <italic>CD24</italic>, which showed changes in transcription in response to HNF1A loss, did not show direct binding, indicating an indirect mechanism of regulation (data not shown). <italic>POU5F1</italic> transcription was found to decrease in both NY8 (34.3&#x0025;) and NY15 (41.5&#x0025;) cells, with weak enrichment of a putative regulatory region previously shown to bind HNF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Consortium, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Malakootian et al., 2017</xref>) (data not shown).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we identified the transcription factor HNF1A as putative regulator of a PCSC gene signature. Functional studies revealed that HNF1A was not only central to the regulation of this gene signature, but also PCSC function. Depletion of HNF1A effectively inhibited PDA cell growth, tumorsphere formation, and tumor growth, with a loss of PCSC numbers observed both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanistically, HNF1A appears to promote stemness through positive regulation of pluripotency factor POU5F1/OCT4. Finally, we found that expression of HNF1A-activated genes significantly predicted poor survival outcomes in patients with PDA. These data point to a novel oncogenic role for HNF1A in pancreatic cancer, particularly in PCSCs.</p>
<p>A clear role for HNF1A in PDA has not previously been established. An early study of the putative oncogene FGFR4, frequently expressed in PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ohta et al., 1995</xref>), is directly regulated by HNF1A through intronic binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shah et al., 2002</xref>). More recently, 73&#x0025; of PDA samples were found to stain positive for HNF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kong et al., 2015</xref>). A more direct role for HNF1A in PDA has been suggested by multiple GWA studies implicating certain SNPs in HNF1A as risk factors for the development of PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pierce and Ahsan, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wei et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Nearly all of the identified HNF1A SNPs are non-coding and relatively common (minor allele frequencies between 30-40&#x0025;), suggesting these SNPs may serve as potential contributing rather than driving factors in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Interestingly, PDA associated HNF1A SNPs rs7310409, rs1169300, and rs2464196 are also associated with both an elevated risk (1.5-2 fold) of developing lung cancer and elevated circulating C-reactive protein (CRP). A well-established direct target of HNF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Toniatti et al., 1990</xref>), CRP is downregulated in patients with inactivating mutations in HNF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Thanabalasingham et al., 2011</xref>). As several</p>
<p>PDA-associated SNPs are associated with elevated CRP, it is therefore possible that these SNPs augment the activity/expression of HNF1A rather than diminish it, as in the case of maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3) variants which reduce or abolish HNF1A expression or function. Still, a tumor suppressive role for HNF1A in PDA has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hoskins et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies HNF1A was found to possess pro-apoptotic/anti-proliferative properties contrary to the data in this study. Differences in these results may be technical in nature (control cells in Luo et al. exhibited unusually high baseline apoptosis approaching 50&#x0025;), however it is also possible that the role of HNF1A may differ between different molecular subtypes of PDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>) or in a dynamic manner like fellow transcription factor PDX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Roy et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data on HPDE and HPNE cells support a partially transforming capacity for HNF1A, wherein it overcomes contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth. As cooperation with oncogenic KRAS was observed in these cells, it is feasible that HNF1A provides additional oncogenic input, possibly by altering the differentiation state of KRAS-mutant, precancerous pancreatic cells or by expanding the resident stem cell/cancer stem cell population. Indeed, expression of HNF1A alone was sufficient to increase CD24 expression/positivity in both HPDE and HPNE cells.</p>
<p>Typically a marker of endodermal differentiation, HNF1A has not previously been reported as necessary for normal or cancer stem cells. HNF1A plays a critical role in the normal functionality of the endocrine pancreas, with hereditary inactivating mutations in the gene and promoter region resulting in MODY3, an autosomal dominant form of diabetes resulting from &#x03B2; cell insufficiency. Additionally, murine knockout models recapitulate the diabetic phenotype seen in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lee et al., 1998</xref>), with elegant transcriptomic work demonstrating a requirement for murine Hnf1a in &#x03B2; cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Servitja et al., 2009</xref>). The role for HNF1A in the exocrine pancreas is less clear, and compared to islet and liver cells in the latter study, we only identified 11 overlapping HNF1A-activated genes <italic>(ANXA4, CEACAM1, CHKA, DPP4, HNF4A, HSD17B2, LGALS3, MTMR11, NR0B2, SLC16A5, TM4SF4)</italic>, suggesting distinct activity for HNF1A in PDA compared to either &#x03B2; cells or the liver. Regulation of OCT4 by HNF1A is an especially exciting finding, connecting HNF1A with a previously unidentified role in regulating stemness. Although we have yet to determine precisely how HNF1A regulates <italic>POU5F1</italic> transcription, previously published HNF1A ChIP-seq data performed in HepG2 cells by The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Consortium, 2012</xref>), identified a region of enrichment of HNF1A upstream of the POU5F1/PSORS1C3 gene loci proximal to recently identified promoter regions for the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Malakootian et al., 2017</xref>), supporting direct regulation of OCT4 by HNF1A. Additionally, enrichment of this region by TATA-binding protein (TBP) and acetylated lysine 27 histone H3 supports the involvement of this region in the transcription of OCT4. As this region, rich in repetitive elements/retrotransposons, is not conserved between humans and rodents, it is possible the interaction between HNF1A and OCT4 is an acquisition of human evolution and may explain why OCT4 has not previously been identified as an HNF1A target. Our ChIP-seq data show a weak enrichment of HNF1A within this region and direct HNF1A ChIP shows a 2.5-4 fold enrichment in NY8 and NY15 cells. This lack of a robust identifiable interaction does not preclude direct regulation, but it suggests other indirect mechanisms may be just as important in regulation of OCT4 expression by HNF1A.</p>
<p>Given that 26 HNF1A-activated genes (17 direct targets) were found to be significantly associated with poor survival in patients with PDA, it is likely that multiple target genes contribute to HNF1A&#x2019;s oncogenic influence, and future studies should be done to assess the functions of these genes in PDA to ascertain their value as either potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Further studies are also needed in regards to HNF1A&#x2019;s role in the exocrine pancreas and whether its function is redirected during the development of PDA, particularly under the influence of oncogenic KRAS. Overall, this study further validates the importance of HNF1A to PDA while providing a novel and critical role for HNF1A in driving pancreatic cancer stem cells.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Tumor growth assays</title>
<p>8-10 week old, evenly sex-mixed NOD/SCID mice were used for all experiments. Orthotopic implantation of PDA cells to the pancreas has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine/5 mg/kg xylazine, and a small left subcostal incision was performed. 10,000 PatGFP-Luc2-labeled tumor cells in a volume of 50 &#x03BC;l (1:1 volume of cell suspension in growth media and Matrigel) were injected into the tail of the pancreas using a 30-gauge needle. Weekly bioluminescent imaging of implanted orthotopic tumors in mice was performed using a Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System (Xenogen Biosciences, Cranbury, NJ). For subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells, 10,000 tumor cells in a volume of 50 &#x03BC;l (1:1 volume of cell suspension in growth media and Matrigel) was injected subcutaneously into both the left and right midflank regions of mice. Tumor growth was monitored weekly by digital caliper and tumor volumes calculated by the (length x width<sup>2</sup>)/2 method. All mice were sacrificed once any tumors reached 20mm<sup>3</sup> in volume.</p>

<title>Lentiviral constructs</title>
<p>Lentiviral destination vectors were generously provided by Dr. Andrew Aplin (Thomas Jefferson University). For construction of HNF1A, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, GFP and LacZ cDNA lentiviruses, pLentipuro3/TO/V5-DEST, pLentineo3/TO/V5-DEST, pLentihygro3/TO/V5-DEST were used. For OCT4A, pLenti6.3/UbC/V5-DEST was used. An EcoRV digested/re-ligated pLenti6.3/UbC/V5-DEST (removing the Gateway cloning element) was used as an empty vector control. For construction of shRNA lentiviruses, pLentipuro3/BLOCK-iT-DEST was used. Human HNF1A and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> were cloned from primary PDA cDNA into pENTR&#x2122;/D-TOPO<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (Invitrogen). Human OCT4A was cloned from pCR4-TOPO clone BC117435 (Transomic Technologies) into pENTR&#x2122;/D-TOPO<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>. LacZ and PatGFP (a variant of EGFP containing the following mutations: S31R, Y40N, S73A, F100S, N106T, Y146F, N150K, M154T, V164A, I168T, I172V, A207V) were also cloned into pENTR&#x2122;/D-TOPO<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> as control proteins. For labeling cells with firefly luciferase, PatGFP was fused to the N-terminus of firefly luciferase Luc2 (subcloned from pGL4.10) and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> using Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs).

<title>Mapping and analysis of ChIP-seq and Bru-seq</title>
<p>For ChIP-seq, 52-base, single end reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using Bowtie v1.1.1 (with options: -n 3 -k 1 -m 1). Peaks were called using MACS v1.4.2 using the default options. MACS peaks overlapping ENCODE blacklist regions were removed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR636HFF">https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR636HFF</ext-link>). Each peak was assigned to the closest gene&#x2019;s transcription start site (TSS). Then, for each TSS, the distance to the nearest peak was measured. If the nearest associated peak was within &#x002B;/- 5 kb of the TSS, it was considered proximal. In the absence of a proximal peak, the nearest associated peak within &#x002B;/- 100 kb of the TSS was considered distal. A gene was recognized as having a proximal or distal peak if at least one replicate in both cell lines identified a proximal or distal peak. If a gene was found to have both proximal and distal peaks (usually due to differences between replicates), the gene was identified as distal if it had distal peaks in both replicates of both cell lines, otherwise it was identified as neither. For Bru-seq, 52-base, single end reads were aligned first to ribosomal DNA (U13369.1) using Bowtie v0.12.8 and the remaining reads aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using TopHat v1.4.1. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq v1.24.0 (R v3.3.1).

Gene expression values were obtained from the Level 3 RSEM genes (normalized) data set and log<sub>10</sub>-transformed prior to analysis. Samples identified as tumors and of non-neuroendocrine origin were used. Genes were selected based on Bru-seq and/or ChIP-seq as per above and linked (where possible) to TCGA expression data through Entrez ID or HUGO gene symbol. Survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier estimate and log-rank test, was performed using the R package survival (v2.40-1). Patients were stratified as &#x201C;high&#x201D; and &#x201C;low&#x201D; based on the median gene expression. For genes within a given set, the fraction of genes associated with reduced (or increased) survival with p &#x003C; 0.05 was calculated. For each selected set of genes (e.g. HNF1A-activated genes), a permutation test (N&#x003D;10,000) was performed using randomly-selected sets of genes expressed in NY8 and NY15 cells. The fraction of genes significantly associated with reduced (or increased) survival was calculated (as above) and the resulting null distribution used to test significance of the given selected set of genes.

<caption><title>Overexpression of HNF1A and mutant KRAS in HPDE and HPNE cell</title>
<p>(A) HPDE and HPNE cells expressing LacZ (L), KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> (K), HNF1A (H), or HNF1A with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> (HK) were analyzed by Western blot to confirm transgene expression and activation of downstream signaling events. For doxycycline-inducible HPDE cells, cells were treated &#x00B1; doxycycline (Dox) (100 ng/ml) for 7 days prior to analysis. (B) HPDE cells expressing inducible LacZ, HNF1A, LacZ with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, or HNF1A with KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> were grown to super-confluency (2 weeks) in the presence of 10&#x0025; FBS &#x002B; Dox to test for changes in contact-inhibition. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Representative images (100X magnification) are shown. (C) Flow cytometry analysis of CD44 and CD24 surface expression on HPDE cells expressing LacZ or HNF1A for 7 days or HPNE cells expressing LacZ or HNF1A.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Effects of HNF1A depletion on PDA xenograft biology</title>
<p>(A) 10<sup>3</sup> control or HNFlA-depleted NY5 cells were implanted subcutaneously in NOD/SCID mice (10 mice per shRNA/bilateral injections) for 6 weeks. Tumors were measured by caliper to determine tumor growth. Statistical difference was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett&#x2019;s multiple comparisons test. Red and green p values indicate LacZ2.1 vs. HNF1A#1 or #2, respectively. Representative tumors are shown (lower panel). (B) Western blot analysis of HNF1A and Actin from NY5 tumors expressing LacZ2.1 or HNF1A shRNAs (4 tumors per group) demonstrating persistent knockdown <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<caption><title>Rescue of OCT4 expression in PDA cells</title>
<p>(A) NY8 cells transduced with OCT4A or empty vector control (EV) were transiently transfected with control (Ctl) or HNF1A-targeting siRNA for 72 hours, and then grown in tumorsphere media on non-adherent plates (1500 cells/well). Representative images of tumorspheres are shown. (B) Quantitative RT-PCR for OCT4 transcript <italic>(POU5F1)</italic> was measured in NY8 and NY15 EV or OCT4 transduced cells transfected with control or HNF1A siRNA for 72 hours. <italic>ACTB</italic> transcript was used as an internal control, n&#x003D;3.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Association of HNF1A-responsive genes and survival in PDA</title>
<p>(A, B) HNF1A-responsive genes were ranked according to log-rank test p-value and direction of survivability based on TCGA PDA patient data. All HNF1A activated genes (bound and unbound) (A) and repressed genes (B) were analyzed. Y-axis units are log<sub>10</sub>-transformed p-values (higher magnitude indicates greater significance). Positive y-axis indicates association of gene expression with increased survival; negative y-axis indicates association of gene expression with reduced survival. Red bars indicate p &#x003C; 0.05 (gray &#x003D; not significant). Dotted line indicates p-value threshold of 0.05. Inset: histogram representing null distribution for fraction of genes significantly associated with increased survivability. Vertical red lines represents value for set of HNF1A-activated or -repressed genes, respectively. For N&#x003D;10,000, the estimated error at p&#x003D;0.05 is &#x00B1;0.0034 (less than 10&#x0025;).</p></caption>
